this document is a summary of the European Public Relations Report ( EP@@ AR ) which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations on the application of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information regarding the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of tablets ( tablets which dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ l thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance , a mental disorder in which the patients alternate man@@ ic episodes ( periods of an@@ or@@ mal@@ er high mood ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe episodes and to prevent some episodes in patients who have approached the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces if the oral consumption of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used for inser@@ ting or sm@@ el@@ ting tablets in patients receiving difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
&quot; for patients who use other medicines at the same time , the same as abili@@ fy A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of abili@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably appears as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is like 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser degree the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itters work to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps norm@@ alize the activity of the brain causing mental or man@@ ic symptoms to be reduced and their re @-@ occurrence is prevented . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy , to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms , has been studied in three studies over a year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased anxiety over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , abili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ rence in 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with abili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study involving 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , suffering from increased anxiety , with which Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and plac@@ ebo were compared to a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the change in the patient &apos;s symptoms was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment . &quot;
the company also carried out studies to investigate how the body res@@ or@@ bs the sm@@ el@@ ting tablets and the solution to intake .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution showed patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than plac@@ ebo in four of the five short @-@ time studies . &quot;
abili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo for the re @-@ occurrence of some episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg cans also decreased more effectively than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of abili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyram@@ idal distur@@ ban@@ ces ( un@@ controlled ) , sed@@ ation ( con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , cereb@@ ral hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( increased s@@ ali@@ va production ) , fatigue and fatigue , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and severe some episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were predomin@@ ant compared to the risks .
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with some episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder , if oral therapy is not appropriate , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the traff@@ icking of A@@ bili@@ fy across the European Union . &quot;
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes responded to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient population , a lower initial dose should be taken into consideration when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induction is derived from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorder , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no elevated risk of suicide in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with known car@@ dio @-@ vas@@ cular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that are used for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; when treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occur should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a brain , or uncle@@ ar high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of brain , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including abili@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states that are related to sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant correlation between dosage and response for undes@@ irable cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including abili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with abili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side @-@ effects , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally acting drugs with over@@ bearing side effects such as sed@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist family , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects , and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; in CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabolism . &quot;
considering the common administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors with abili@@ fy the potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , like I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects , and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after passing the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose @-@ height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 to be administered together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the insufficient data security situation in humans and the concerns originated in animal reproductive studies , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for the fo@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) as under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of adverse events described below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ha@@ ze , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia were compared to patients treated with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy . &quot;
some episodes of Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ treatment .
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS is 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase for over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , in which potential clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with arias , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia , and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional acute over@@ doses with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in treating an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is useful in the treatment of an over@@ dose , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma protein ban@@ da@@ ging . &quot;
it is suspected that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D3 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tor .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ recep@@ tor and a ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to the alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and the hi@@ stam@@ ine H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; in the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks in healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 recep@@ tor lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the put@@ ative . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a semi @-@ op@@ i@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ dents were respon@@ sive in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measured values defined as secondary study objectives , including PAN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ min@@ ence rates , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for over 26 weeks of stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher rate of response was seen for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % among plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) in an average weight of ca . &quot;
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I @-@ disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed an effective efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therapy trial with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed an effective efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also showed a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia as lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partially over 2 weeks did not lie on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirror , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy in reducing some symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was considering the prevention of bi@@ polar retro@@ activity mainly in the prevention of a reg@@ ression into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the Deh@@ ydr@@ ation and Hydro@@ xy@@ lic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ell@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean elimination of elimination is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on extensive metabolism of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism over CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a Pop@@ ular @-@ specific analysis of the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not indicate clin@@ ically significant differences in the eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , pre@@ clinical data could not recognize any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent non @-@ alcoholic toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 @-@ 10 times the average Ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis as a consequence of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile after re@@ peti@@ tive oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day was established ( 1 @-@ 3 times the average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times of the recommended maximum dose in people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations found in human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole not more than 6 % of concentrations observed in the study over 39 weeks in G@@ alle of monkeys , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ sol@@ ub@@ ility . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dosage . &quot;
&quot; perfor@@ ated bli@@ ster packs for delivery of single cans made of aluminium in folding boxes with 14 x 1 , 28 x 1 , 49 x 1 , 56 x 1 , 98 x 1 tablets . &quot;
&quot; 15 late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
it is suspected that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D3 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tor .
&quot; 22 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was considering the prevention of bi@@ polar retro@@ activity , mainly in the prevention of a reg@@ ression into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; 27 late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;

&quot; 34 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was considering the prevention of bi@@ polar retro@@ activity , mainly in the prevention of a reg@@ ression into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; 39 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
it is suspected that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D3 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tor .
&quot; 46 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was considering the prevention of bi@@ polar retro@@ activity , mainly in the prevention of a reg@@ ression into the man@@ ia . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing A@@ bili@@ fy tablets can take the enam@@ el tablets alternatively to abili@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorder has been reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a brain are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side @-@ effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) as under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I @-@ disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed an effective efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .

&quot; the recommended starting dose for abili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to prevent recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , therapy should be continued with the same dose . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;

&quot; 92 In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 to be administered together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
some episodes of Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is suspected that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D3 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tor .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) in an average weight of ca . &quot;
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study about 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I @-@ disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy volunteers lay the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .

&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dosage . &quot;
abili@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control as@@ cul@@ ti@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep in the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ fer@@ ment of obes@@ e regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used already for maintenance or ac@@ utely therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if secondary oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy sm@@ el@@ ting tablets or abili@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no investigations on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution is considered necessary , patients should be monitored regarding severe sed@@ ation or blood pressure ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations on the safety and effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with known car@@ dio @-@ vas@@ cular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that are used for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a brain are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly regarding wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side @-@ effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; however , the intensity of the Sed@@ ative was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in which healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) was applied intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly and which simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist family , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism , the common use with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , like I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects , and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after passing the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose @-@ height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of the Sed@@ ative was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole after all@@ ure . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more frequently in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of adverse events described below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; 107 The subsequent adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under plac@@ ebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) : &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase for over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , in which potential clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with arias , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy include mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia , and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution combined with statisti@@ cally significant major improvements of ap@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity / behavi@@ our@@ al compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term trial ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , as well as as@@ cul@@ ti@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms as compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the mean improvement observed from the initial value to the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe det@@ achment , a similar effectiveness has been observed in relation to the total population , but a statistical significance could be determined on account of a decreased patient count . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ der respon@@ dents were respon@@ sive in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measured values defined as secondary study objectives , including the PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg Dep@@ res@@ ence rates , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for over 26 weeks of stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia ( oral ) showed a significantly higher decrease in the incidence rate at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % in plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) in an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partially over 2 weeks did not lie on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mirror , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy in reducing some symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was considering the prevention of bi@@ polar retro@@ activity , mainly in the prevention of a reg@@ ression into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the first 2 hours after intr@@ amus@@ cular injection , the AU@@ C is 90 % larger the AU@@ C after giving the same dose as a tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time until reaching the maximum plasma treatment was 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and apes and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after re@@ peti@@ tive application in a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) that were 15 and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intr@@ amus@@ cular .
&quot; in studies on reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity after intra@@ ven@@ ous application no safety @-@ related concerns arose after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ mal ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and can@@ o@@ inting potential , pre@@ clinical data could not recognize any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which clearly exceed the maximum dosage or exposure of humans ; therefore they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al @-@ rin@@ den toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 @-@ 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile duc@@ al dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day has been noted ( 1 @-@ 3 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16 to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ times of the average steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dosage . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters were used to obtain anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in any administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in the main study , 72 ( 31 % ) of the patients responded to the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; considering only patients treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time , there was no difference between the efficacy indicators such as time to deteri@@ oration of disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer in relation to these indicators showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; it is also not allowed to be used in patients , nursing or before the beginning of the treatment low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) states that Abra@@ x@@ ane was no longer propos@@ ing , more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and that in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines , drugs should not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited appro@@ ving the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in patients with the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series . &quot;
&quot; in case of sens@@ orial neu@@ rop@@ athy , grade 3 is to break down until a recovery is reached on grade 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no trials involving patients with impair@@ ment of ren@@ al function have not been carried out and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of ren@@ al function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to not sufficient data on the safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ articles formulated by pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el which may have much other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be removed and sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient should not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no new Abra@@ x@@ ane cycles have been introduced until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils rose again &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the number of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proven , cardiac promin@@ ence in the indicated patient &apos;s collective is not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if patients after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , they can be treated with common anti@@ em@@ ics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating agents . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used during pregnancy or in women in child@@ bearing age , which do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ tion method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to be@@ get no child during and up to six months after treatment .
&quot; before treatment , male patients should be advised about a sperm @-@ conservation , since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ versible in@@ fertility . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ red@@ ness ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) that can affect the traffic humidity and the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma who were treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III trial .
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most noticeable importance of hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly re@@ versible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in table 1 the side effects reported in combination with the dosage of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy occurred at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced pot@@ assium in the blood heart disease : &quot;
&quot; ha@@ ylo@@ id , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burn , dry mouth , pain@@ less g@@ ums , loose stool , es@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of kid@@ neys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot;
&quot; pain in the chest wall , weakness of the mus@@ cul@@ ature , head@@ ache , performance pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , flan@@ k pain , dis@@ comfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent : &quot;
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive fall in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules substance that promotes the accumulation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ col@@ oration .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to a in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and within the framework of in @-@ vitro studies has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport is convey@@ ed through the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ recep@@ tor and because of the alb@@ um@@ umin@@ ated protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the area of the tumour .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast carcin@@ oma is supported by 106 patients in two single @-@ armed un@@ blind@@ ed studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparative study .
&quot; in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an inf@@ usion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as inf@@ usion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma .
&quot; this multic@@ entre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el each 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion with pre@@ medication ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a affected overall condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy previously , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ as@@ ation and 19 % because of metast@@ as@@ ation and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line treatment are outlined below .
&quot; neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who , at a time during the therapy , evaluated peripheral neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ies grade 3 . &quot;
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for the sound of bas@@ eline based on the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the active substance ex@@ positions ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml as equivalent to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration took off in a multi @-@ phase mode .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to far @-@ reaching extra@@ vas@@ cular distribution and / or w@@ edge binding from pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour intra@@ ven@@ ous injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; the Clear@@ ance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ic ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the total total dose of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available on patients at the age of more than 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light light protected over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ular drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be handled with caution when dealing with abra@@ x@@ ane .

member states must ensure that the holder of the approval for the market launch brought the medical specialist staff in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials :
&quot; • Education brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , label and packaging allowance . • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product , provided cooling boxes for the transport through the patients . &quot;
this means that Ab@@ ys@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron values , where blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur , if a blood loss is not possible before the procedure and a loss of blood from 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ ys@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood don@@ ors , Ab@@ ys@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be done by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have given appropriate instructions . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
the iron values of all patients are to be controlled before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency is needed and iron supplements should be given throughout the treatment .
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used prior to surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the effects of blood loss .

&quot; Ab@@ ys@@ amed was compared to a v@@ ein in a v@@ ein as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , compared to the reference medicine . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to Ab@@ ys@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period during the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; furthermore , the company presented the results of a study in which the effects of ab@@ ys@@ amed under the skin were analysed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were placed on Ab@@ ys@@ amed were maintained in the same degree as with those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ ys@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , side @-@ like mig@@ raine like head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ ys@@ amed may not be used in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ ys@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ sec@@ ound according to the European Union regulations , evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , which makes Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information packages for medical personnel in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission approved Medic@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ t &amp; Co KG , a permit for the marketing of Ab@@ ys@@ amed across the European Union . &quot;

&quot; the treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate in case of planned larger operative interventions , which require large blood volume replacement ( 4 or more units of blood in men ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ ys@@ amed can be used in adults with no iron deficiency , where high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected . &quot;
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected bleeding loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml may not be applied to an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients with hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6,@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient over or below the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dosage is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permitted dose needed to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia .
these clinical findings suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by means of intra@@ ven@@ ous application , if necessary with an increase in dose of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target is reached ( this should take place in increments of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms and consequ@@ ential symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permitted dose needed to control the symptoms .
&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ yte number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be retained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in rise &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ yte number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l is increased compared to the bas@@ eline value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 treatment weeks with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ yte number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be retained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ yte number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , is an approach to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy impro@@ b@@ able and the treatment should be abor@@ ted . &quot;
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rine 33 - 39 % ) in which the pre @-@ stock@@ ed storage of ≥ 4 blood con@@ serving should be obtained twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - to allow large iron reserves to be available before the start of the Ab@@ ys@@ amed therapy .
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this case epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg on 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a feed needle , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to flush the hose and ensure sufficient inj@@ ections of the drug in the circulation . &quot;
patients suffering from the treatment with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ine at er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia ( PR@@ CA ) should not receive Ab@@ ys@@ amed or another er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ine ( see Section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ enia ) .
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous plat@@ el@@ ets ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are fores@@ een for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure and which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , esc@@ ort arter@@ ial oc@@ clusive disease , vas@@ cular disease of the carcin@@ oma or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular event . &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare has been reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ine .
&quot; in patients with sudden active loss , defined as a decrease in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions , the anti@@ lo@@ y@@ tic value should be determined and the usual causes of a non @-@ response ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ um toxic@@ ation , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ine antibody is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ine antibodies are determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row should be weigh@@ ed for diagnos@@ ing a PR@@ CA . &quot;
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ ys@@ amed in patients with a risk for antibody induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In cases of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , in case of maintenance therapy , the upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in case of maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , an increased mort@@ ality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating active agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical trials have demonstrated no significant benefit which is attribut@@ able to the dosage of epo@@ chs when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased over the concentration required for the control of the ab@@ norm@@ alities and the avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ f@@ usions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of increased blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evi@@ d@@ ent cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded with maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; in tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ine response should be taken into account ( patients may need to be trans@@ acted ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is exceeded 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ a@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; the decision for the use of re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment , taking into account the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , before starting the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should have an appropriate thro@@ mbo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vas@@ cular diseases , especially in a underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be ruled out that during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an output of &gt; 13 g / dl can be an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vas@@ cular events . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , it was not proven for epo@@ et@@ ins that they could improve overall survival in tumour patients or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer , receiving chemotherapy , a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7,5 - 8,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted &quot;
&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adjusted to the rising hem@@ at@@ oc@@ ite . &quot;
in @-@ vitro studies on tumour tissue no indications result from an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .

the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vas@@ cular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
&quot; independent of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ine treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after re@@ peti@@ tive blood supply can result in th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vas@@ cular complications . &quot;
&quot; the gene@@ tically obtained epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ ci@@ ated and in relation to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate part , identical to the end@@ ogen@@ ous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ine , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ aesthetic patients . &quot;
it could be shown with the aid of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and progression were examined in five large controlled trials involving 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo controlled studies and progression .
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ine and patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ine were consistent with an@@ a@@ emia due to various common mal@@ ign@@ ancies , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mort@@ ality than in controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ine patients and on controls satisfactory .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ine , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ine in tumour patients receiving chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa regulations after re@@ peti@@ tive intra@@ ven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um levels achieved after intra@@ ven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no accumulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well known comp@@ lication of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study on hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased by the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;

these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples which are for the clinical situation but of uncertain sig@@ natures .

&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ ys@@ amed once for a maximum of 3 days outside the fridge and not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; prior to the launch and agreement with the competent authorities of member states , the holder of the authorization for the marketing department has to provide the medical specialist staff in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials : • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product , provided cooling boxes for the transport through the patients . &quot;
the holder of the authorization for the placing on the market has to ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system imposed in version 3.0 is set up and functioning in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application application before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as the drug used in the traffic is applied .
&quot; the owner of the authorization for the placing of the company comm@@ its himself to the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) specified in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan , as agreed in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. and according to each subsequent update of the Risk Management Plan pursuant to each subsequent CH@@ MP update . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Nut@@ products for human use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided with the next updated report on the safety of the medicine ( peri@@ odic safety update report , P@@ ST ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • upon receipt of new information , the influence on current safety specifications ( safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or the risk reduction in question ) mil@@ estones • upon request by the E@@ MEA &quot;
• suffer a heart attack or stroke within a month prior to your treatment • if you suffer from un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or intensi@@ fied chest pain ) - if the risk of bleeding in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ) has occurred - if for example a such blood c@@ lot occurred .
&quot; you suffer from severe blood circulation disorders ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clusive disease ) , the arter@@ ial vas@@ cular disease ( vas@@ cular disease of the car@@ ot@@ ides ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ) you recently suffered a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; during the treatment with Ab@@ ys@@ amed it can result in a light dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood cells within the normal range , which is re@@ formed during further treatment . &quot;
your doctor will possibly perform regular blood tests to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment regularly .
&quot; iron deficiency , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or Follow @-@ acid deficiency should be taken into account and treated before the beginning of the therapy with Ab@@ ys@@ amed . &quot;
very rare has been reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ y after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ine .
&quot; if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ enia , it will ab@@ ort your therapy with Ab@@ ys@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
therefore Ab@@ ys@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intra@@ ven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value reduces the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; in case of elevated or ascending pot@@ assium levels , your doctor may consider inter@@ ruption of treatment with Ab@@ ys@@ amed until the pot@@ assium levels are back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically clear cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or disease signs by inadequate cardiac output , your doctor will make sure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to present findings , blood poverty treatment with ab@@ ys@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and the desired effect should be taken into account for ass@@ essing the efficacy of Ab@@ ys@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ sec@@ ound dosage accordingly in order to keep the risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully compared to the advantages derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vas@@ cular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if in the past already th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vas@@ cular events occurred ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ ys@@ amed appears like a growth factor for blood cells and in some circumstances affect the tumor neg@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; if you have an or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic surgery , before the start of treatment with Ab@@ ys@@ amed the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood pigment ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ ys@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood graf@@ ting after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take / apply other medicines , or have recently taken / use , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ ys@@ amed , your doctor may possibly arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF ( G @-@ C@@ SF and GM @-@ C@@ SF are a means to build up the immune system ( for example for cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
&quot; depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia ( an@@ a@@ emia ) refers to treatment , the dose may be adjusted every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor will possibly arrange regular blood tests to check the success of treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
&quot; once you are well set , you get regular doses of Ab@@ ys@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread over two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
your doctor will possibly arrange regular blood tests to check the success of treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
&quot; depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia respon@@ ds to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted about every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure this and to ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor treating doctor will perform regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of intervention and another 4 days after surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your physician considers this appropriate , also learn how to sp@@ lash out Ab@@ ys@@ amed yourself under the skin . &quot;

Ac@@ tu@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones become br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a sli@@ ghtest degree of hip frac@@ ture like with H@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or inj@@ ected into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after application of acet@@ am@@ ol can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after inf@@ usion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the substance in Ac@@ credi@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ ra , a portion of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ ra was used to evaluate acet@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of verteb@@ ral and hip frac@@ tures has been studied over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who had recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years . &quot;
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get ac@@ last@@ a was tested in two studies to a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) .
&quot; the main indicator for the efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in ser@@ um ( an enzyme , the bone substance ab@@ norm@@ alizes ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ credi@@ a ( excluding other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatments ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under Ac@@ credi@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicines ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study of men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ credi@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most of the side effects of acet@@ last@@ a occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less frequent with repeated inf@@ usions .
Ac@@ credi@@ a may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with Ac@@ credi@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the inf@@ usion site and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ond ( canc@@ er@@ ous bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of acet@@ am@@ ea provides information for physicians to prescri@@ be the Ac@@ credi@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;

&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package should be provided and include the following core messages : • The requirement of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When looking back on medical or nursing assistance &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg of acet@@ last@@ a is recommended once a year for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men .
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the dose of the inf@@ usion of acet@@ last@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the disease Pa@@ get . &quot;
&quot; after treatment of the Pa@@ get treatment with acet@@ one , a long re@@ mission has been observed in patients who responded to therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly recommended in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of acet@@ last@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first acet@@ last@@ a inf@@ usion . &quot;
the incidence of symptoms occurring within the first three days following the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen can be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see Section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance &lt; 35 ml / min ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended since limited clinical experiences exist for this patient population .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and adolescents under the age of 18 are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age .
Ac@@ last@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experiences exist for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia must be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before beginning the treatment ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary one may develop sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly recommended in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of acet@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered before applying bis@@ phosph@@ onate treatments with appropriate prev@@ ent@@ ative dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental implants , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ onate can reduce the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw range . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen can be reduced shortly after application of acet@@ am@@ ol ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; the incidence of adverse events reported by atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation was increased in patients receiving ac@@ last@@ a ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the total incidence of fibr@@ ill@@ ation ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; kidney function disorder Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ amine was associated with kidney dysfunction , which expressed itself as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase of the ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured before administration ) and the incidence of kidney failure as well as a limited kidney function were comparable in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to the acet@@ ate and plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after the application was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with acet@@ one compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , performed in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ credi@@ a in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ credi@@ a in the disease @-@ Pa@@ get trials . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on the prevention of clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on the prevention of clinical frac@@ tures after a recently suffered hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ credi@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the inf@@ usion point , such as red@@ ness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw range was used , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw area ) that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ onate , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ yel@@ itis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks . &quot;
7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients performed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw range in one with acet@@ last@@ a and in a patient treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the case of an over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hy@@ po@@ kal@@ z@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by offering oral calcium and / or an intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ credi@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) or a BM@@ D T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 2,5 with or without indications of an existing verteb@@ rate frac@@ ture . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric spine frac@@ tures were significantly reduced over a period of three years as well as after one year the incidence of one or more new verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
patients aged 75 and older had decreased by 60 % compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on acet@@ ate frac@@ tures Ac@@ credi@@ a showed an equal lasting effect over three years , resulting in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in one by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ credi@@ a increased bone density in the lum@@ bar spine , hip and the dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 increase of bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.7 % , the entire hips by 6.0 % , the shr@@ ink@@ age by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
bone hist@@ ology With 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) one year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the pel@@ vic dam .
&quot; in comparison with plac@@ ebo , a micro@@ computer tom@@ ographic ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone volume and the preservation of tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone architecture . &quot;
&quot; bone turnover marker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal test@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study duration . &quot;
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of acet@@ last@@ a reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the output value up to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the output value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the output value up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not measured rout@@ inely , but the majority of patients received a receiving dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ U. oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before inf@@ usion . &quot;
overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with ac@@ last@@ a compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the BM@@ D increase in the overall fragrances and fem@@ oral neck during plac@@ ebo treatment at all times . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with plac@@ ebo treatment , the Ac@@ credi@@ a treatment resulted in an increase in the BM@@ D by 5.4 % on total assets and 4.3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als . &quot;
clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 508 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ credi@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % in plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study in males ( Study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of ac@@ last@@ a compared to the weekly administration of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; clinical effectiveness of the treatment at the disease Pa@@ get des Kno@@ chen Ac@@ credi@@ a was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically approved , particularly light to moder@@ ately heavy morph@@ ine Pa@@ get of the bone ( medium Ser@@ um levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with 2,@@ 6@@ oC to 3,@@ 0@@ times age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) . &quot;
11 The effectiveness of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months has been proven in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
the combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control compared to the initial value for acet@@ last@@ a and ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( response to therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from the 143 patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a and the 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach of 141 of patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a could be maintained at a mean duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dos@@ sier independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma gas rose rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the highest value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life times t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early part phases ( α and β , with the above 1 ½ -@@ values ) presum@@ ably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body Clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h irrespective of the dose and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the inf@@ usion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the inf@@ usion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
&quot; a dimin@@ ished clearance of metaboli@@ zed substances by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or irre@@ versible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ amine cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing , and was in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function down down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require dosage adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ amine .
because there are only limited data for severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) there are no statements for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and at rats 0.6 m@@ g. / kg body weight .
&quot; in studies in dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C were 6@@ times of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intra@@ ven@@ ous application was given the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid in rats , administered in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to the fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , corresponds ) , well toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions that exceed the maximum of the intended Human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects with other organs , including the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract and liver , and the intra@@ ven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most common finding in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aph@@ or of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
&quot; on rats , one observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in doses of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton . &quot;
&quot; no ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed on rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the degra@@ ded ser@@ um calcium level . &quot;
&quot; if the drug is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; usually 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;

&quot; the patient information package should be provided and include the following core messages : • The requirement of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet 17 • Major signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When looking back on medical or nursing assistance &quot;
&quot; July 2007 , completed on 29 September 2006 , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation is and works before and while the product is marketed . &quot;
risk Management Plan The owner of the authorization for the placing of the office under@@ takes to conduct the trials and additional activities on the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance specified in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in Module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and all following versions of the R@@ MP approved by CH@@ MP .
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for human medicinal products , the revised R@@ MP was to be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ ST ) . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current statements on safety , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone has been reached ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ amine is a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ onate , used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , mainly est@@ ro@@ gens formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the more gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; in the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , the bone structure becomes too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tu@@ a works by norm@@ alizing bone reconstruction , ensuring normal bone formation and thus gives the bone strength again . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ credi@@ a . &quot;
&quot; if you use Ac@@ credi@@ a with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you take / apply other medicines or have recently taken / use , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is especially important to know if you are taking drugs , of which it is known that they damage the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when applying Ac@@ credi@@ a together with food and beverages , you are worried that you will receive sufficient fluids according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after treatment with Ac@@ credi@@ a . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is given to you by your doctor or nurse as inf@@ usion to a v@@ ein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to admini@@ ster Ac@@ credi@@ a two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is given to you by your doctor or nurse as inf@@ usion in a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; since Ac@@ credi@@ a has a long period of time , you may need another dose after one year or more . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood in time after inf@@ usion is not too low .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ credi@@ a can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need another treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of Ac@@ credi@@ a is missed , please contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before you end your treatment with Ac@@ credi@@ a Falls you are considering the completion of the treatment with Ac@@ credi@@ a , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
adverse reactions in connection with the first inf@@ usion occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of patients ) and are less frequent after inf@@ usions .
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days following the administration of Ac@@ credi@@ a . &quot;
&quot; at present it is uncle@@ ar whether Ac@@ credi@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Ac@@ credi@@ a . &quot;

&quot; allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if one of the listed side effects may adver@@ sely affect you or notice side effects that are not listed in this use information . &quot;
&quot; if the drug is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions right up to the application ; usually 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture are advised to carry out the inf@@ usion of acet@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of acet@@ amin@@ a , patients need to be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia develops , whose maximum occurs normally within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of ac@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ credi@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended prior to the inf@@ usion of acet@@ last@@ a . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; compli@@ a is used in addition to a diet and exercise for adult patients suffering from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above , respectively • which are over@@ weight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond one or more &quot;
&quot; in addition , four trials were carried out in more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting the smoking . &quot;
the studies on setting the smoking could not show consistent results so that the effectiveness of A@@ compli@@ a was difficult to assess in this area of application .
&quot; which risk is associated with compli@@ a ? it The most common side effects of compli@@ a , which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) , were nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tract n@@ g The complete list of adverse events related to A@@ compli@@ a is the package supplement . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti @-@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it can strengthen the risk of depression and can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among others in a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is advisable while using medication such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for using HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , Tel@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Clari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ compli@@ a with regard to weight reduction in patients with obesity or over@@ weight
medicines used in patients who need it from health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing education packages for patients and doctors ) and around the Ar@@ z
it appreci@@ ates diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or obes@@ e patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) who additionally have one or more risk factors like type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; compli@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , due to lack of data for effectiveness and safety . &quot;
&quot; La Dep@@ res@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms have been reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in up to 1 % of the patients receiving the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used in depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefit of the treatment in the individual case predomin@@ ates the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who - besides obesity - have no recognis@@ able risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other related persons ) should point out that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and seek emergency medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• Ol@@ der patients The efficacy and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) before less than 6 months were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

&quot; of over@@ weight patients , as well as in patients with obesity , and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in other indications . &quot;
the following table ( table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in patients who were treated for weight reduction and associated metabolic disorders .
it was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ate ( for undes@@ irable effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for undes@@ irable effects &lt; 1 % ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; often ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rarely ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä &quot;
&quot; in a toler@@ ability study , in which a limited number of persons were administered up to 300 mg , only slight symptoms were observed . &quot;
the patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
&quot; weight reduction after one year was more than 20 mg of 6.5 kg for compli@@ ments compared to the bas@@ eline value , compared to 1.6 kg for the plac@@ ebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4.4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ compli@@ a 20 mg and 1.2 kg in the plac@@ ebo group ( difference -@@ 3.8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4.4 ; -@@ 3.3 ; p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
&quot; after 2 years the difference in the total weight reduction between compli@@ a and plac@@ ebo -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3.4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
9 Weight reduction and other risk factors In studies in patients without diabetes in which a mixed population of patients with

&quot; in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.9 % for both groups ) after 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 among plac@@ ebo &quot;
the percentage of patients who achieved a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % amounted to 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; the difference of mean weight changes between the 20 mg and the plac@@ ebo group was 3.8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2,@@ 6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients that had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % caused by direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % by reducing weight reduction . n eim Ar@@ z

patients with black skin color can have a reduction of up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ x and a reduction of 43 % lower AU@@ C than patients of other ethnic populations .
n popul@@ ation@@ - har@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analyses ( age range 18 - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year @-@ old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ X and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
&quot; 5.3 Pre@@ clinical data for the safety of the following adverse effects , which were not observed in clinical studies , but which were n@@ g in animals after exposure in the human therapeutic sector , were considered possibly relevant for clinical use : &quot;
&quot; in some , but not in all cases , the beginning of con@@ vul@@ sions involving proced@@ ural stress seems to be associated with animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant has been given over a longer period prior to mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no undes@@ irable effects on fertility or cycle disorders have been observed . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study on rats for pre@@ - and post @-@ nat@@ al development , an exposure to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behavior or memory . &quot;

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Relations Report ( EP@@ AR ) which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations on the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) .
&quot; it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , which can not be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ ated dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ resin or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ resin or insulin can be maintained with the commen@@ cement of the Ac@@ tos @-@ Treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here should be reduced the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ resin and insulin . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level drops , whereby type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ gic was studied ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels were lowered to 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the trial study , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ resin in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values increased by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional administration of plac@@ ebo resulted in a decrease of 0.35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study where the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 289 patients , patients receiving ac@@ tos in addition to insulin showed a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who additionally took plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ es@@ thesia ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , or in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high blood levels - in the blood ) . &quot;
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients during a mon@@ otherapy ( in common use ) in which Met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
October 2000 the European Commission issued the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to appro@@ ve Ac@@ tos in the whole European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and wear on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and e@@ dem@@ a , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
cardiovascular out@@ patient study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in heart failure reports , which did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output of liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal range ) , or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzymes are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , super@@ structure complaints , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dar@@ ker urine , the liver enzymes are to be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the patient &apos;s treatment continues with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be conducted by the clinical evaluation prior to the use of the laboratory parameters .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can ag@@ itate fat deposits and in some cases linked to a fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction of the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) occurred during the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral dual or triple combination therapy with insulin , or as a two @-@ fold combination therapy with insulin , is the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , thi@@ az@@ ol@@ ite Indi@@ ans , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , were reported about a occurrence or deteri@@ oration of di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a decrease in visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is uncle@@ ar whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients talk about disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding frac@@ tures of random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one &quot;
&quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medi@@ co . &quot;
&quot; in Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were observed in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 Fra@@ gran@@ ces per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with PI@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Fra@@ gran@@ ces per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medi@@ co . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or this occurs , treatment is recommended ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; drug interactions that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , i.e. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ C@@ A reduc@@ ers are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a lowering of the AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the Hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ a@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the parent can be reduced and thereby reduced the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for the fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very frequently &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the molecule and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents across three times the upper limit of the normal range were often similar to plac@@ ebo , but less than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ ates . &quot;
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease incidence of severe heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than under plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one res@@ p .
&quot; since the market launch it has rarely been reported about heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies has been conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medi@@ co . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures found 44 / 870 ( 5.2 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medi@@ co . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific key recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome prolifer@@ ator activated re@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose levels in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial for 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three months optimi@@ zing stage with insulin , were random@@ ised to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients receiving only insulin , a reduction in insulin doses in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , there was a statisti@@ cally significant decline in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent compared to the bas@@ eline values . &quot;
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small study of type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics in a small study on 18 weeks .
&quot; in most clinical trials compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slightly , however clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel was observed under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one while observed under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active trial , a cardiovascular disease study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease were random@@ ized in groups that received either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ bed , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in plasma are usually achieved 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , M @-@ IV &apos;s contribution to effectiveness is approximately three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , it was demonstrated that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral application of radio@@ active mark@@ eter pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the subjects ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma elimination period of unchanged Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and all active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced ren@@ al function lower than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of the oral Clear@@ ance of the mother substance are similar . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies coinci@@ ded with mice , rats , dogs and apes respectively after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and re@@ versible hyper@@ trop@@ hic hyper@@ trophy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the Hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ a@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the parent can be reduced , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for the fet@@ al growth . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder were induced . &quot;
&quot; in an animal model of the famili@@ al aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ ites resulted in increased frequency of col@@ on tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and wear on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medi@@ co . &quot;
&quot; in Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were observed in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 Fra@@ gran@@ ces per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with PI@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Fra@@ gran@@ ces per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medi@@ co . &quot;
in another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were investigated .
&quot; in clinical studies over 1 year , there was a statisti@@ cally significant decline in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent compared to the bas@@ eline values . &quot;
&quot; in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , which has an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study missed the target regarding its primary end@@ point , which presented a combination of the overall mort@@ ality , non @-@ mort@@ al m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , cor@@ on@@ ary vas@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the ing@@ es@@ tion of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not involve cardiovascular long @-@ term risks . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events relating to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients receiving treatment medi@@ cal@@ ation , increased incidence of bone frac@@ tures in women showed itself . &quot;
&quot; in Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were observed in 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 Fra@@ gran@@ ces per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with PI@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Fra@@ gran@@ ces per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medi@@ co . &quot;
&quot; in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one did not only reduce the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is usually applied once or twice daily if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror that indicated that the blood sugar levels were significantly reduced as with another human insulin insulin .
Ac@@ ro@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ one may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to remove the package contents ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
October 2002 the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to introduce Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane to the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; for example , patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly by an intensi@@ fied insulin therapy can change the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change in terms of starch , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA opposite insulin of animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change of animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; before travelling , going over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used and taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the doctor must consider possible interactions during the therapy and always consult his patients after other medicines taken by them . &quot;
4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia which can occur in a non @-@ controlled di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ therapy increase the risk of de@@ form@@ ities and fruit death in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias may lead to un@@ consciousness and / or con@@ vul@@ sions and end with temporary or permanent disorders of brain function and even death .
disorders of the nervous system Gels - Peri@@ pher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy A quick improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are referred to as acute pain neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually re@@ versible .
5 An intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar setting can however be associated with a temporary decrease in di@@ ab@@ etic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and the breath@@ able tissue Gel@@ ally - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point may develop a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy if failed to switch the inc@@ isions within the injection area .
&quot; public hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection point during insulin therapy can occur local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ ness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) . &quot;
&quot; diseases of the immune system gel @-@ free - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized skin r@@ ash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , g@@ astro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ on@@ eur@@ otrop@@ ic oil , pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and power@@ lessness / un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; however , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be gradually developed : • Light gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can be treated through the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods . &quot;
&quot; therefore , di@@ abe@@ tics should always have grape vines , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cu@@ its or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) through a proven aid person or through glucose that is given intra@@ ven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of cle@@ av@@ age ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by the cle@@ av@@ age are active .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and the reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot;
it is recommended - after the acet@@ oph@@ ane pier@@ cing bottle was taken out of the fridge - increase the temperature of the insulin to room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is res@@ us@@ cit@@ ated according to the operating instructions for the first use .
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change of animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the doctor must consider possible interactions during the therapy and always consult his patients after other medicines taken by them . &quot;
12 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia which can occur in a non @-@ controlled di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ therapy increase the risk of de@@ form@@ ities and fruit death in uter@@ o .
13 An intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar setting can however be associated with a temporary decrease in di@@ ab@@ etic retin@@ opathy .

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ yl@@ ide may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
October 2002 the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to introduce Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id to the European Union .
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin that can be quickly acting must first be raised , then the amount of insulin acting . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; before travelling , going over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used and taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; 5 General conditions and complaints at the place of performance Gel@@ eg@@ lig - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions to the injection point Wh@@ ile the insulin therapy can occur local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ ness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) . &quot;

&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the entire duration of action is approximately 7 to 8 hours . &quot;
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of acet@@ yl@@ ide was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) di@@ ab@@ etic children ( between the ages of 6 and 12 ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
&quot; the data is limited , but suggests that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to adults . &quot;
&quot; inf@@ usion systems with acet@@ yl@@ ide in concentrations 0,@@ 05 I.@@ U. / ml - 1.0 I.@@ U. / ml insulin human in inf@@ usion fluid 0.9 % sodium chl@@ oride , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % D- Glu@@ cose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l pot@@ assium chl@@ oride are stable when using inf@@ usion bags made of polypropylene at room temperature for 24 hours . &quot;

&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level still lies more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 m@@ g. a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , g@@ out attacks can still occur ; therefore , patients should take at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines to prevent g@@ out attacks . &quot;
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t since it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( fake medications ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for treating hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood in the last three measurements were below 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients receiving a dose of 80 mg once a day , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients , who once daily intake 120 m@@ g. a day in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and ab@@ normal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular , patients with heart complaints in pre @-@ history may also have an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to at@@ yp@@ al deposits ( including one from the patient &apos;s history known or currently available gyp@@ sy node and / or a gyp@@ sy arthritis ) .
&quot; if the ser@@ um acid bar is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose of dosage can be taken into account on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;

&quot; children and adolescents There are no experiences with children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ta@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients . &quot;
&quot; since organ transplan@@ t recipients have no experience in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ta@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure , the treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ eis is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ astic medicines , it may cause acute aband@@ on@@ ment during the course of treatment because , by lowering the ser@@ um acid acid pi@@ eg@@ els , it is initially possible to mobili@@ ze ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissues . &quot;
&quot; B. in mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases so far that it comes to a depos@@ iting in the urine tract . &quot;
&quot; during Phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3,5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test prior to the beginning of the Feb@@ ux@@ sta@@ atic treatment and in subsequent course depending on clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ was did not have interactions with Feb@@ ux@@ ta@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition could lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( a in@@ hibition of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
&quot; in subjects , the simultaneous administration of Feb@@ ux@@ ta@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated with an increase in Feb@@ ux@@ peri@@ ate exposition ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
in clinical trials the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase of undes@@ irable events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ sta@@ ate can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dosage adjustment for Feb@@ ux@@ oc@@ ate or the simultaneous active ingredient is required .
&quot; in a study involving subjects 120 m@@ g. of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of Feb@@ ux@@ ta@@ at on the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous sei@@ z@@ ure of an ant@@ acid , magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminium hydro@@ x@@ ide , delayed intake of Feb@@ ux@@ ta@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease of C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not allow any side effects of Feb@@ ux@@ ta@@ at to include pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect negative effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC has no adverse effect on their performance . &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events was observed in the overall fine pa@@ ve group compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al link with Feb@@ ux@@ oc@@ ate could be detected .
the risk factors determined in these patients were arter@@ i@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could occur in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg Feb@@ ux@@ ta@@ at and which have been reported in all Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at treatment groups in total more than once , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in simultaneously . * * In clinical trials no severe r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 90@@ 6 patients have been treated for up to 3 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients for up to 4 years with Feb@@ ux@@ ta@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the treatment @-@ related events related to long @-@ term studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at treatment groups in total more than once and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ ux@@ peri@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 for these doses or with less frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hyp@@ na@@ es@@ thesia , con@@ spic@@ uous EC@@ G , cou@@ gh , short breath , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in the blood , decrease of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic count , decrease the number of white blood cells . &quot;
ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ in@@ metabolism in humans and arises as part of the reaction chambers Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
&quot; Feb@@ ux@@ ta@@ at is a potent , non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for the in vitro @-@ in@@ hibition that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;
&quot; clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month had specific ser@@ um @-@ acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 267 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) for patients with a ser@@ um incre@@ ment at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the conven@@ tionally used dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with ser@@ um incre@@ mental values &gt; 1,5 and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were collected for analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg &quot;
the lowering of the ser@@ um acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor visit during week 2 and sustained throughout the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um in@@ in@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function limitation ( i.e. h .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decrease in ser@@ um acid concentrations in patients , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dysfunction ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study together ) had a ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data gathered in the open extension study phase 3 showed that the permanent lowering of the ser@@ um acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out attacks , so that less than 3 % of patients needed a treatment against a po@@ ison rate in the months 16 @-@ 24 . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the size of the plaster node , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the no@@ des until month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ W / ml ) were observed in patients receiving a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ta@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ ux@@ sta@@ ate increased dose of dose of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for j@@ ars between 120 mg and 300 mg a rise in AU@@ C is observed for Feb@@ ux@@ peri@@ at which is greater than the dos@@ si@@ ro@@ por@@ tional increase .
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 m@@ g. a day , the C@@ MA@@ x is approximately 2,8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decline in ser@@ um acid concentration was observed if this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of Feb@@ ux@@ sta@@ ate is between 29 and 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the Plasma Cutting of Feb@@ ux@@ sta@@ ate amounts to approx . 99.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites , these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are mainly formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ oc@@ at@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide is mainly caused by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ ized Feb@@ ux@@ ta@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose found in the urine as un@@ altered Feb@@ ux@@ sta@@ ate ( 3 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide of the active substance ( 30 % ) , whose well known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) , as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair found itself as an imm@@ utable February @-@ block ( 12 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide of the active substance ( 1 % ) , whose well known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) , as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; special patient groups of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 m@@ g. of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of Feb@@ ux@@ ta@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal ren@@ al function . &quot;
the mean total @-@ AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ ta@@ at took about the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 Li@@ ver function limits After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ - Pu@@ gh classification B ) or medium @-@ severe ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Classi@@ fication B ) of liver function restriction modified the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C from Feb@@ ux@@ ta@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites did not change significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age No significant changes were observed with regard to the AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ oc@@ ate or its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites following taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats was found a statisti@@ cally significant increase in ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ors ( Transi@@ tional cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed group , with approximately 11 times the exposure in humans . &quot;
these findings are considered as a consequence of a specific pur@@ ging and urine composition and are considered not relevant to clinical application .
it has been found that Feb@@ ux@@ ta@@ at has in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
&quot; in case of high doses , which were approximately 4.@@ 3- times of human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which associated with a decrease in breeding capacity and a develop@@ mental retard@@ ation in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; Ter@@ at@@ ologic studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions that are about 4.@@ 3 times and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which are approximately 13 times the human@@ Therapeu@@ tic exposure , have no ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic effects . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ sta@@ ate can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dosage adjustment for Feb@@ ux@@ oc@@ ate or the simultaneous active ingredient is required .
&quot; di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in simultaneously . * * In clinical trials no severe r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 21 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 90@@ 6 patients have been treated for up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients for up to 4 years with Feb@@ ux@@ ta@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month had specific ser@@ um @-@ acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; the data gathered in the open extension study phase 3 showed that the permanent lowering of the ser@@ um acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out attacks , so that less than 3 % of patients needed a treatment against a po@@ ison rate in the months 16 @-@ 24 . &quot;

in some people the ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid is in@@ soluble .
&quot; if you keep the ur@@ inary acid concentration low due to the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the cryst@@ alli@@ sation is prevented and thus a decrease in the dis@@ comfort is achieved . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may not be used , if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the drug Feb@@ ux@@ it@@ at or any of the other components of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
inform your doctor before you start taking this medicine if you have a heart failure or suffer from any other heart problem . • If you suffer from a high ur@@ inary acid concentration result in a cancer illness or the Les@@ ch Ny@@ han syn@@ dro@@ mes ( a rare con@@ genital disease where too much ur@@ ic acid is in the blood ) .
&quot; if you have a g@@ out attack at the moment ( sudden appearance of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , red@@ ness , warmth and joint swelling ) wait before you start treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to be with everyone , but may also occur with you , especially during the first treatment weeks or - months , when you take AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
your doctor will prescri@@ be you other medicines when needed in order to prevent a g@@ out attack or to treat the symptoms associated with it ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take / apply other medicines , or have recently taken / use , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; it is especially important that you inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking drugs / apply one of the following substances since interactions with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may occur , and your doctor may consider necessary measures . • The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in ( for the treatment of as@@ thma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood th@@ inning in heart disease ) &quot;
no trials have been carried out on the impact of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC on transport humidity and the ability to operate machinery .
please do not take AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC after consultation with your doctor if you know that you suffer from intoler@@ ance to certain sugars .
&quot; on the back of the bli@@ ster pack the individual week@@ days are printed , so you can check if you have taken one tablet every day . • The tablets need to be swal@@ lowed and can be taken with or without food . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day that should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data obtained from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who received exclusively al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot;
the company also presented data that suggest that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( swelling ) , irrit@@ ated abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as su@@ cking cl@@ ut@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any of the other components AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used for diseases of the es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission , Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . , granted approval for the traff@@ icking of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only used with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following hints are to be observed exactly to reduce the risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or break the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not lie before the first dietary intake of the day that should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract , except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions such as es@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al strips , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( some were severe and required hospit@@ alization ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore attention to all signs and symptoms pointed to possible mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to susp@@ end the medicine at the occurrence of symptoms of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn , and seek medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of serious op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms , which indicate an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate no increased risk was found , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ yel@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regime contains predominantly intra@@ ven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available that indicate whether or not using bis@@ phosph@@ onate treatment in patients who need a s@@ late surgical procedure , the risk of oste@@ on@@ osis of the jaw . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is crucial for the treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted to take a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after notic@@ ing their failure .
&quot; they should not take two tablets on the same day , but will continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned at the scheduled day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may imp@@ air the absorption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate when taken at the same time . &quot;
therefore patients need to wait at least 30 minutes after taking al@@ end@@ ron@@ at before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;

&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D from the spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to maintain ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur hal@@ ses and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily dose of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new fluid bed by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate 7.9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption on an intra@@ ven@@ ous reference dose was the medi@@ al bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after fast fasting and two hours before consuming a standardized breakfast .

&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot;
in healthy volunteers the oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) did not lead to any clin@@ ically meaningful change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .

&quot; characteristics of patients with pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , which is not depos@@ ited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available , it is nevertheless expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , using Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f using Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a treatment duration of one year ( for example investigating how often a new organ transplan@@ t or re @-@ recording of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
&quot; in addition , more than 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were conducted and examined how Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is absorbed by the body in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;

&quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other components , Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f may not be applied . &quot;

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clinical @-@ relevant differences in the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this may result in transplan@@ t rejection or an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over @-@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and appropriate daily dosage ; change@@ overs of the formulation or the regime should be carried out only under tight control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a change to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level provisions ( see below )
&quot; after the conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror should be controlled before conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; day 4 was the systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , with both form@@ ulations in both ni@@ er@@ a- and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clearance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient in the first postoperative period does not permit oral consumption of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be initiated intra@@ ven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate to produce an inf@@ usion fluid ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; for the suppression of the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral advoc@@ ate therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustments can be required later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of the stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
&quot; dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation , proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral advoc@@ ate therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f must be converted from twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , so this change in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , referred to the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once daily the treatment with the recommended oral dose for transplan@@ t treatment with the recommended adult dose for kidney and liver transplan@@ tation has to begin .
&quot; heart transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ t recipients Even though there are no clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and rec@@ tos@@ sed patients in an oral initial dose of 0,2 mg / kg / day and in case of pancre@@ atic recep@@ ts in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions , dose adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function in the targeted field may be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions . &quot;
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Since the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , careful monitoring of ren@@ al function ( including regular determination of the ser@@ um cancer , a calculation of the cre@@ atine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f With the conversion from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the blood level in the thorou@@ gh@@ bred The dose should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the help of full @-@ blood tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us level controls .
it is recommended to perform common checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic inspec@@ tions during maintenance therapy .
&quot; blood @-@ Tal@@ ks of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while using substances that could alter the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us whole blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a drug with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the ste@@ ady state has occurred . &quot;
the data in clinical trials can be concluded that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the level of seb@@ um in the blood cannot exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the blood level of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation is usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and ven@@ eers - and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious undes@@ irable events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects caused by tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and appropriate daily dosage ; change@@ overs of the formulation or the regime should be carried out only under tight control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f are still available . &quot;
no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f are still available for proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients .
&quot; because of possible interactions leading to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements containing cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other herbal remedies during a treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea there is a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases a cardiac or sep@@ tic hyper@@ trophy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore occur under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clin@@ ically dis@@ rup@@ tions are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , hyper@@ tension and o@@ est@@ rogen . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to possible risk mal@@ ign@@ ant skin les@@ ions due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ ache , changed levels of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f Hart@@ kap@@ capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded , lac@@ tose are present in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , and consequently increase or decrease the blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore advisable to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels while offering substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism , and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain even concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ic such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole , as well as with the Macro@@ eyel@@ id antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies showed that the increase in blood levels largely resulted from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the in@@ hibition of g@@ astro@@ intestinal decay . &quot;
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other drugs Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; hence , the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is associated with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , whose metabolism impacts . &quot;
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us lowers the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus can increase the hormone exposure , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures should be particularly cau@@ tious . &quot;
the results of animal testing have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us may potentially decrease the Clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure a monitoring of the new@@ born child is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on the kid@@ neys ) .
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ re@@ ali@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the side effects profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va can often be identified precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; the side effects are listed in descending order : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often increased in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , prot@@ o@@ zo@@ al ) . &quot;
cases of F@@ BK virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy including therapy with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors related to the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and high bonding to er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ tic . &quot;
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On a molecular level the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should be convey@@ ed by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ oli@@ an protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular nucle@@ us .
this results in a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent revers@@ ing of sign@@ alling path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymph@@ oma genes .

&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to the observations in the large studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was applied in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; lung Transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis over a recently conducted , multic@@ entre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported over 110 patients receiving either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in during 1 : 1 random@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; chronic corneal gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ate syndrome , was less frequent in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot;
patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us came to 21.@@ 7 % of cases to develop bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) as the number of patients converted from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection , was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.7 % versus 45.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) in the treatment transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ated syn@@ dro@@ mes was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
P@@ ank@@ re@@ ast@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation A multic@@ entri@@ c study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was carried out to 205 patients simultaneously receiving pancre@@ atic and ren@@ al transplan@@ tation following a random@@ ized Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0,2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to achieve the desired level of the valley from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric clinical trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive after intestinal transplan@@ ts showed a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ sh@@ aug@@ mentation , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ists D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , which lead to tal@@ low levels between 10 and 15 n@@ g / ml and recently fet@@ al gra@@ ft radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as a low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ ite value and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher Clear@@ ance rati@@ os observed after transplan@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly via the bile . &quot;
&quot; in stable patients who were converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( once daily ) in proportion 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) below Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than in Pro@@ gra@@ f . &quot;

&quot; advoc@@ ates are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( caused by the lack of factor VIII , con@@ genital blood co@@ ag@@ ulation disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether adv@@ ate is used for the treatment of bleeding or for preventing bleeding in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VIII lack , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced according to a method known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; : &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it conduc@@ ts for the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced differently so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the drug used to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of advoc@@ ates in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ is@@ odes has been &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of advoc@@ ates ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ ates may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII , mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the marketing of advoc@@ ates throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII , according to the location and the extent of the bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition . &quot;
&quot; in the following ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII @-@ activity should not fall under the specified plasma gas ( in % of the standard or I.@@ U. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
repeat injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is over .
&quot; during the course of treatment , it is recommended to control the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections to control the dose of VIII . &quot;

3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. by factor VIII per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out in order to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
the dosage of dosage should be based on the patient &apos;s condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII oriented Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml of plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with exposure to factor VIII , determining the risk within the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in untreated patients ( P@@ TP ) with more than 100 re@@ positioning days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically well @-@ known inhibit@@ or development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low tide ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s encountered in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which have higher risk of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ ache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients respectively ) . &quot;
&quot; very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII @-@ spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ate inf@@ usion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the VI@@ II@@ - mirror in plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th postoperative day .

&quot; in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed serious to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) was found after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or . &quot;
in previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical study 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) patients treated with A@@ DV@@ ate inhibit@@ ors inhibit@@ ors to factor VIII .
&quot; the immune response of the patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by investigating the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an persistent peak of anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise no signs or symptoms occurred , indicating an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients were isolated from the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ i gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions during the study . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP continued to evaluate the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ate , which makes a submission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the approval owner should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited announced the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company takes its application for approval of the Adv@@ ex@@ in Office for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer .
&quot; normally , however , the breasts , the brain , bones or soft tissues ( tissues which connect other structures in the body are affected and supported ) are affected . &quot;
this is a type of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the non @-@ defective gene in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study involving a patient , in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer occurred in the area of the abdom@@ en , bones and brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP checked the company &apos;s answers to the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; based on the review of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP generates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ours brings benefits to patients . &quot;
&quot; the Committee also had concerns regarding the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not know whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed active ingredients &quot; means that the tablets are so combined , that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( ha@@ y fever by an allergy to pol@@ len caused inflammation of the nas@@ al passages ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are abbrevi@@ ated . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be trac@@ ed to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main ap@@ titude measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y fever symptoms which were reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; considering all ha@@ y fever symptoms , except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients receiving the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease of the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients receiving p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; when only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients with aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze showed a decrease of the symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who received dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , head@@ ache , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow @-@ angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension caused by cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the marketing of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without bit@@ ing , breaking or ch@@ ew@@ ing ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after closing the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use duration to 10 days , as in long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ in can decrease with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary . &quot;
&quot; as aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after termination of such a therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ eyel@@ id , cab@@ erg@@ olin , ox@@ idi@@ az@@ ep@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s collective and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce the appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze was not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suff@@ ice to award appropriate dosage recommendations .
&quot; patients need to be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythms , nau@@ sea , or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or strengthening of head@@ aches ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; treating patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before the completion of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines can otherwise inhi@@ bit positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to their degree . &quot;
&quot; in the course of clinical trials with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed . &quot;
&quot; the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests showed no significant differences between the patients with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be excluded completely .
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate , nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , however , experience from a large number of affected pregnant women did not result in increasing the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to frequency in the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; patients should however be informed that in very rare cases , it may lead to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , which may lead to impair@@ ment of traffic humidity or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( sed@@ ation , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ ors , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible Latvian procedures . &quot;
&quot; head@@ ache , anxiety , difficult mi@@ tion , muscle weakness , and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ ale pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , ap@@ tax@@ ia , hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ il rigi@@ dity , and dil@@ at@@ ation , skin oils , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human stem cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on the standard measurement parameters of the flight gli@@ ding , including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in recommended dosage can indu@@ ce other sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , with 414 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the caus@@ tic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall results for the symptoms ( except nose @-@ mu@@ c@@ um swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex , age or ethnic origin . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow @-@ equilibrium of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , it was discovered that four test persons were badly metaboli@@ zed . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole administration of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was equivalent to exposure to the gift of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination possessed no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the content of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
in reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic in dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits at a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described is established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines contribute to alle@@ vi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hi@@ stam@@ ine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets rel@@ ieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( ha@@ y fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and so@@ othing or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;
&quot; 20 In certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ cos@@ a ab@@ rup@@ ting drug p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine which is contained in this medicine . &quot;

if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform@@ ing immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
&quot; if you have forgotten the dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose on time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the appropriate time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects may adver@@ sely affect you or notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
&quot; heart ch@@ ase , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , neck pain , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in the urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , head@@ ache , sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , nerv@@ ousness and ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness . &quot;

&quot; after the launch of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , very rare cases of severe allergic reactions ( breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin r@@ ashes have been reported . &quot;
&quot; cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart hunting , stomach pain , nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , stomach complaint , di@@ zz@@ iness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness with increased physical activity , over cases of liver inflammation and about cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver values was also very rare . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 ml and 5 mg of tablets ( tablets which dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.25 mg once a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup and respectively . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and two studies to patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; effectiveness has been measured by determining the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the square , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance during the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body utilize the sy@@ rup , the solution to inhal@@ e and the sm@@ el@@ ting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe . &quot;
&quot; in allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom ( symptom rating ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the reduction of the symptom was based on six @-@ weeks treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit for the Office of Inland A@@ erial Transportation in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to rel@@ ieve symptoms in allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see under section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the use of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents between 12 and 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous disease progression and can be ended after the symptoms of symptoms and can be res@@ um@@ ed when re@@ occurring .
&quot; in the case of persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks ) , patients may be recommended during the allergy term . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol , alcohol did not increase the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should however be informed that in very rare cases , it may appear to be ligh@@ the@@ aded , which may lead to impair@@ ment of traffic humidity or the ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials of various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us daily than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; adverse events reported more frequently than with plac@@ ebo were ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study at which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were administered .
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human stem cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered daily over 14 days .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was revealed . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on the standard measurement parameters of the flight gli@@ ding , including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can be classified as an alternative also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated by the total quality of the questionna@@ ire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , regardless of eti@@ ology , is similar in the different forms and chronic patients can be easily pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; since the hi@@ stam@@ ine of hi@@ stam@@ ines is a caus@@ al factor in all age @-@ related diseases , it is expected that dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n will also lead to an improvement of symptoms in other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , which is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines was excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness significantly as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to assess these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , where patient demo@@ s were comparable to the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis population , a higher concentration of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant accumulation following once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo , dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate , nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no comparable degree of exposure to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independent of meals , to rel@@ ieve symptoms in allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see under section 5.1 ) . &quot;
prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see under section 4.4 ) and that no data is available that support a treatment of inf@@ ectious r@@ hin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are restricted to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and have a higher rate of substance ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years , which is inhi@@ bited , is identical to that of children who are normally metaboli@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol , therefore patients should not take with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials using A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children from 2 to 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up Group similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
children between 1 and 11 years old who were eligible for an anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy received a daily lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dose of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chronic i@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was revealed . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. daily for adults and adolescents was not observed by increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets led to no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or in adults and adolescents in clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not lead to a strengthening of alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment or an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adults and you@@ thful patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the total quality of the questionna@@ ire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively dimin@@ ish the caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this constra@@ ined phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black people ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis that are restricted .
the loading ( AU@@ C ) through des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x is about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient co@@ ag@@ ulation following once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were compared with those of adults who received the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be excluded completely . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up is available in type III bra@@ ce bottles with a child @-@ resistant Poly@@ propylene output cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;

&quot; immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate must be removed without dam@@ aging it . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials using A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials of various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study in which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were used .
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used daily over 14 days .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was revealed . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day . &quot;
&quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight gli@@ ding , including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the total quality of the questionna@@ ire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , where patient demo@@ s were comparable to the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis population , a higher concentration of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;

&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us processed enam@@ el tablet as a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets Formul@@ ation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat for the det@@ achment formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses , which was used for a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight gli@@ ding , including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this badly metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 3 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
&quot; in single @-@ dose @-@ crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us Schmel@@ z@@ enges with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in conjunction with dose @-@ fin@@ ing studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;
&quot; food does not have significant influence on AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x of A@@ eri@@ us A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat , while food T@@ max of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n increased from 2.5 to 4 hours and T@@ max of 3 @-@ O@@ H@@ - Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n from 4 to 6 hours . &quot;
the overall analysis of pre@@ clinical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the enam@@ el tablet found that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ation in clinical application .

&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg elt tablets proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets Formul@@ ation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat for the det@@ achment formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used daily over 14 days .
&quot; in a 30 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight gli@@ ding , including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
in single @-@ dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg enam@@ el tabl@@ ette with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat for intake were the form@@ ulations bio@@ equivalent .
the overall analysis of pre@@ clinical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the enam@@ el tablet found that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ation in clinical application .
&quot; the safety of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which is inhi@@ bited , is identical to that of children who are normally metaboli@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol , so patients should not take this medicine with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
the total incidence of adverse events in children from 2 to 11 years was similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; in inf@@ ants between 6 and 23 months , the most frequent adverse events reported more frequently than with plac@@ ebo reported di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , at a single dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years . &quot;
the recommended doses were the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see Section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. daily for adults and adolescents was not observed by increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can alternatively also be found in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the total quality of the questionna@@ ire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively dimin@@ ish the stress caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this constra@@ ined phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black people ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; because A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s solution to take the same concentration of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio@@ equivalent study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were compared with those of adults who received the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company receives its application for approval for the use of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of flu virus which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a influ@@ enza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new stem of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to man , because people have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; after the vaccine is approved , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will later be able to produce faster antibodies in contact with a influ@@ enza virus . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognizes as body @-@ alien ) was dis@@ connected , stir@@ red up and used as part of the vaccine . &quot;
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine is insufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information regarding the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti @-@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , as@@ thma is available as a solution to intake , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination was not studied . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked out which anti@@ viral drugs the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus is addressed to the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ a is based on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , as@@ gener@@ a reduces the amount of blood in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; aids not cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of associated infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ a was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adult adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; this high @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced drug A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 206 adults , who previously had prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after treatment .
&quot; in studies with patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml compared to plac@@ ebo after 48 weeks , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , although of the children who previously had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who previously had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drugs called Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came to a stronger decrease in the viral load after four weeks than with the patients receiving their previously prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of as@@ thma ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence , nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , r@@ ash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ a may not be applied to patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as@@ gener@@ a must not be used in patients , the cur@@ rant ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or pharmaceuticals that are degra@@ ded as well as aspir@@ ase and are health @-@ harmful in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients who are v@@ ast@@ ase take the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ osis ( canc@@ er@@ ous bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the relaxing immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ generic drugs used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years have prev@@ ailed against the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken along with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of as@@ gener@@ a in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited a permit for the marketing of as@@ gener@@ a across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ a is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be given to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic booster of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ ther@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for as@@ thma capsules is 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ a ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for as@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ thma in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children . &quot;
as@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be performed in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ a must not be given simultaneously with medicines , which have a low therapeutic width and also represent the sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a decreased therapeutic effect of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ thma or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ thma does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ generic capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant technical information of this medicine .
patients with previously restricted liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis have demonstrated an increased incidence of liver dys@@ functions under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ tical oids , which are metaboli@@ zed via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the possible benefits of a treatment predomin@@ ate systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , including mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is highly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ a with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some drugs that cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the active substance concentration . &quot;
&quot; for patients taking this medicine at the same time , as@@ gener@@ a can be less effective because of reduced plasma pi@@ v@@ ots ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r the effectiveness of hor@@ m@@ onal contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r at the same time , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if even low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are given . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ on content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
as@@ gener@@ ase should be ab@@ used in duration 5 if a r@@ ash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported about the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases in which medications were required to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; higher age , and associated with drug addi@@ cts factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ äm@@ op@@ hil@@ en patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in bleeding including spon@@ tan@@ er cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ sis are present . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections , leading to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial ae@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ osis were reported in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines , which have a low therapeutic width and also represent the sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with medicines whose agents are mainly metaboli@@ zed via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
&quot; in trying to compens@@ ate the degra@@ ded plasma cutting through a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often undes@@ ired effects were observed at the liver . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um@@ mirror of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient already includes St. John &apos;s Wort , the am@@ it@@ a@@ virus level and , if possible , to check the viral load and remove the cur@@ rant &apos;s wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vir@@ enz below ) .
&quot; on the other hand , for C@@ MA@@ x it is reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg used twice daily to determine the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme . &quot;
52 % hum@@ bled when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma produced twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ hed surveillance is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , however , due to the fantasy component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and as@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , in the case of E@@ fa@@ vir@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment is required . &quot;
E@@ fa@@ vir@@ enz treatment in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be lower .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in reduces the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , be cau@@ tious as Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeu@@ tical plasma gas . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be undertaken as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ ine is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous dosage of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin resulted in a rise in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ ine is recommended at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ thma in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out but the plasma of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of two daily 700 mg of F@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole on a daily basis resulted in an increase of C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2.@@ 69@@ x compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous use of f@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , among them also sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can , if used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , may cause interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these medicines when applied in combination with as@@ thma .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids do not be used at the same time as as@@ thma as it may result in respiratory disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of anti @-@ con@@ vul@@ sions known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can result in a degra@@ dation of the plasma gas of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um levels of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of this drug . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous ing@@ es@@ tion with as@@ thma can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and intensi@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ onate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ onate plasma was decreasing by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ a with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids is not recommended unless the possible use of a treatment predomin@@ ates the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metaboli@@ zation is highly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced increases in plasma gas at the same time as a@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since plasma gas levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors lead to my@@ opathy including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these medicines is not recommended with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations until stabili@@ zation of the mirror is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased while using Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , as@@ gener@@ a must not be applied together with oral @-@ absorbed Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while caution is recommended while using as@@ gener@@ a with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data on simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma pi@@ ping of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if even low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are given . &quot;
&quot; because of the very low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given at the moment , as the Am@@ pren@@ a@@ vir@@ - dose is to be adjusted when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; while using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with as@@ gener@@ a , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti@@ the@@ rom@@ atic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ m@@ onal contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
&quot; in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study involving pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ pple to the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 12 body weight during breast @-@ feeding . &quot;
&quot; the further development of the seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mat@@ ernity . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most of the side @-@ effects associated with as@@ thma were mild to moderate , early on and rarely led to treatment ab@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether or not they are used in connection with the intake of as@@ thma or another medicine applied to HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of as@@ gener@@ a twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , classified by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication , were performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as during treatment performed under the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fast sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , hyper@@ trophy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cle fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ din / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stal@@ ks ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , 245 NR@@ TI@@ - treated patients under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different NR@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ qui@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontane@@ ously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontane@@ ously within two weeks without the treatment had to be abor@@ ted with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ osis cases were reported in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection , or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre@@ treated patients receiving 600 mg of as@@ gener@@ a twice daily together with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of side @-@ effects ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable to those who received as@@ gener@@ a along with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is observed on signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gas and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ pro@@ ein stages with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ inf@@ ectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blast cells ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ p Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the area of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the relationship between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ble@@ ached treatment schemes with prot@@ eas@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described were rarely observed .
&quot; in sixteen out of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ avi@@ r with 100mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not appear pre @-@ treated patients showed resistance patterns , similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 46@@ I , M@@ 36@@ I , M@@ 46@@ L / M / T / V , I@@ 55@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and their extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred in patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or f@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to f@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions as to the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for analyzing the results of resistance tests . &quot;
in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates can be applied in combination with phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic pattern creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ ossi@@ ble avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated patients ( one out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; in reverse , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems dependent on the number and type of resist@@ ence mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early depar@@ tures of a sin@@ king therapy are recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that may have a det@@ ri@@ mental effect on the subsequent treatment .
&quot; evidence of the efficacy of as@@ gener@@ a in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre @-@ treated adults ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ osi@@ dan@@ dan@@ alo@@ a ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly presented with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to ather@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the part study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis showed the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted average rate of the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ support threshold of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; evidence of the efficacy of un@@ ble@@ edings ar@@ rests is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of whom 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , as@@ thma solution to intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2,5 mg / kg twice daily studied , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the majority of patients treated with PI received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the NR@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml at a medi@@ an increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
19 Based on this data the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; as@@ gener@@ a should be considered in the optimisation of therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children .
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the scale and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l@@ tr ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissues .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in total concentration of the active ingredient in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Ste@@ ady State across the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a substrate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time with as@@ thma ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the dosage of as@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is a 14 % less bio@@ availability than out of the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
&quot; the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of kidney function disorder should be reduced to the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
this treatment regim@@ en leads to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma pi@@ ping similar to those obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas were observed in male animals ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure in humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg am@@ oti@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is uncle@@ ar .
&quot; in the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic use , there was little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vitro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro @-@ core test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ ed nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in the clinical routine by measuring GH@@ F , AL@@ T , and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of as@@ thma or after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed a high mort@@ ality in both the control animals and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in systemic plasma ex@@ positions which were significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage intake , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus elong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which point to a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ a ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for as@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be carried out with caution in patients with weak or minor liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some drugs that cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the active substance concentration are available . &quot;
as@@ gener@@ ase should be canc@@ eled in duration 27 if a r@@ ash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; increased risk of Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug addi@@ cts factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
&quot; on the other hand , for C@@ MA@@ x it is reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma produced twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ hed surveillance is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known . &quot;
E@@ fa@@ vir@@ enz treatment in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ in@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be lower .
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be undertaken as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ ine is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ ine is advised to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available for this . &quot;

&quot; in a clinical trial , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ onate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ onate plasma was decreasing by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with as@@ gener@@ a , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti@@ the@@ rom@@ atic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % res@@ p .
this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fo@@ etus .
&quot; a reproduction study involving pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ pple to the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast @-@ feeding . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ a was studied in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is observed on signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blast cells ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ p Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the area of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M for chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; in reverse , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems dependent on the number and type of resist@@ ence mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; as@@ gener@@ a should be considered in the optimisation of therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component during the dosing interval varies depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Ste@@ ady State across the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or a substrate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time with as@@ thma ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible ; therefore the effect of a ren@@ al function disorder should be reduced to the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas were observed in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure in people after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ele Aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is uncle@@ ar .
&quot; however , there were little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings from the existing exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vitro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ nucle@@ us test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ation test in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ ed nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed a high mort@@ ality in both the control animals and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these results suggest that in k@@ itt@@ ens the metabolic path@@ ways are not yet fully mature , so am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . &quot;

the benefits derived from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; oo@@ ster@@ ous &quot; A@@ tr@@ ase Solution for use was not covered in patients treated with PI previously treated with PI .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore A@@ ther@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swal@@ low capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for as@@ gener@@ a solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , there is no dosage recommendation for simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ a solution to take and low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to avoid this combination in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dosage adjustment for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of as@@ gener@@ a solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col@@ ge@@ hal@@ ts , A@@ gener@@ a solution is contra@@ indicated in case of small children and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;

&quot; in cases where such reactions occur at the output of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ it@@ ated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous acquired means for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and per@@ ine@@ al region , no clinical experiences are present . &quot;
&quot; limited data may indicate a higher rate of ti@@ lt reduction in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient group regarding the elimination of ti@@ lt war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , nose , lips , or hair approach has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during the therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s dis@@ comfort or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin for approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; as currently , no data on long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after the treatment is available , other suitable therapies should be taken into consideration in super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs no clinical experience is present , so the use of previously untreated tum@@ ors is not recommended . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicates that large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) are less likely to respond to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lip . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
local skin reactions often occur but these reactions usually decrease in the course of therapy on intensity or go back after sett@@ ling the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause great dis@@ comfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment can be exposed for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 ac@@ - les@@ ions showed a lower complete cure rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with care in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; from animal studies no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant or after multiple top@@ ical application of quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) were reached , no recommendation should be given during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the most frequently communicated and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in the studies with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions in the field of treatment of the recep@@ tions ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
&quot; among the most commonly reported and probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with side effects include dis@@ comfort at the application location with a frequency of 28,@@ 1 % . &quot;
the bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III reported side effects are shown below .
&quot; the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Creme in the context of side @-@ effect were in these studies a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
the side effects reported by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; this assessment of clinical signs fores@@ een that this plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream frequently came to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ec@@ o@@ sion ( 23 % ) and oils ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the assessment of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these studies , five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is very often caused by severe er@@ y@@ topics ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe scar@@ ring and c@@ abling ( 19 % ) . &quot;
in clinical studies investigating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ sis Alo@@ p@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
&quot; the accidental occurrence of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized itself after oral or intra@@ ven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination , systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies could be demonstrated that the efficacy in regard to a complete healing of the appropri@@ ation in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment is clearly superior .
&quot; at 60 % of patients with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , patients were completely healed ; this was 20 % of the patients with plac@@ ebo treated patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI :
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all patients treated clin@@ ically and stayed for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s effectiveness in three weeks of weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - les@@ ions within a coher@@ ent 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
the yearly data from two combined monitoring studies show a recur@@ ren@@ al rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the permitted indications external ti@@ lt war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not usually occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and therefore have not been investigated . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 years with m@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um cont@@ ag@@ i@@ os@@ um ( i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) . &quot;
minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three weekly application for 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest concentrations of drugs in ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml when applied in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ time after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after top@@ ical application was low to MC @-@ infected skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and was comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ leen weight ; a study carried out for four months to der@@ mal application yiel@@ ded no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in the case of mal@@ ign@@ ant administration on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ours on the application .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ ed , a risk for humans due to systemic exposure is regarded as very low . &quot;
&quot; tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the substance @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;
&quot; it can harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the listed side effects may adver@@ sely affect you or notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
● Col@@ ours ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the gen@@ itals ( sex organs ) and anus ( anus ) ● super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma This is a frequently encountered and slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body .
&quot; if left untreated , it may cause ab@@ norm@@ alities , especially in the face - hence , early detection and treatment are important . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin , which occur in people who were exposed to sun radiation during their previous life . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a should only be used for flat @-@ ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in the face and scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system , where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body combat the super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or the virus responsible for the infection . &quot;
&quot; O If you have previously applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations , please inform your doctor before you begin with the treatment . o Use Al@@ dar@@ a Cream first when the area to treat after a previous drug or surgical treatment is cured . o A@@ void contact with eyes , lips and nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in case of accidental contact the cream should be removed by r@@ ins@@ ing with water . o Do not use the cream inside . o Do not use any more cream than your doctor prescri@@ . o Falls respond to the treated place after applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream not with a ban@@ dage or plaster . o Falls pose any reactions to the treated place , which will give you strong in@@ convenience , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot;
&quot; once the reactions are cleared , you can continue the treatment . o Inform@@ ing your doctor if they do not have normal blood picture &quot;
&quot; if this daily cleaning is not performed under the fores@@ kin , it can be expected with increased occurrence of swelling , th@@ inning of the skin or difficulty in with@@ drawing the fores@@ kin . &quot;
&quot; apply Al@@ dar@@ a Cream not in the ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) , in the vagina ( vagina ) , the cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or within anus ( anus ) . &quot;
&quot; if other medicines have serious problems with your immune system , you should not use this medication any more than one treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; if you have intercourse with genital war@@ ts in the genital region , treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Cream after sexual intercourse ( not before ) can be carried out . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you apply other medicines or have recently applied , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
breast@@ feed your inf@@ ant during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Cream as it is not known whether I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od goes into the breast milk .
&quot; the frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of ti@@ lt , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis ( see specific instructions for each application area ) . &quot;
&quot; apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream on the clean , dry skin place with the ti@@ lt war@@ ts and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is fully absorbed . &quot;
men with fores@@ kin under the fores@@ kin must withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area underneath ( see section 2 &quot; What do you need to consider before applying Al@@ dar@@ a Cream ? &quot; ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
&quot; for 6 weeks , you can apply a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream 5 days a week to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects ( with more than 1 of 10 patients expect ) Frequ@@ ent side effects ( in case of less than 1 of 100 patients ) severe side effects ( in less than 1 of 1,000 patients are expected ) Very rare side effects ( in less than 1 of 10,000 patients ) &quot;
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist as soon as you do not feel comfortable during the application of Al@@ dar@@ a Cream .
&quot; if your skin is too much respon@@ sive to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream to wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
a reduced number of blood cells can make you sus@@ cep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause that a blue stain proceeds in you faster or she can cause fatigue .
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects may adver@@ sely affect you or notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
&quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you applied to Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot;
these are lighter skin reactions which end up again within approximately 2 weeks after the treatment is completed .
&quot; occasionally , some patients notice changes in the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , skin irrit@@ ation , skin irrit@@ ation , swelling , der@@ m@@ atitis ) or irrit@@ ability , nau@@ sea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot;
&quot; occasionally , some patients suffer from changes in the application location ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tions , ul@@ c@@ ers , s@@ ore throat , swelling , swelling , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , s@@ ore throat , fever , weakness or ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the condition ( the symptoms not associated with brain or nerve related ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage it . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neurolog@@ ical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , ag@@ grav@@ ating movements , reduced lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place at a hospital or clinic with rehabilitation aids , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; the study was mainly examined by the safety of the drug , but it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by examining its effect on reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , skin r@@ ash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the inf@@ usion site . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of pul@@ mon@@ ary function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be severely hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; every year the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all the new information that may be known , and where necessary to update this summary . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me manufactures patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with regard to the reactions to the inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit for Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. to manage Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me traff@@ ick@@ ers across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by means of re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese hamster ov@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese hamster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been identified , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect occurring during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should be closely monitored closely , and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be conducted in an appropriate clinical setting in which rehabilitation centres for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical Phase 3 study , nearly all patients are Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usion @-@ related response must be treated with caution when applying al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; because there is little experience regarding res@@ um@@ ption of the treatment after a prolonged break , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions has to be cau@@ tious after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
treat 60 minutes before the inf@@ usion starts with medication ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) in order to minim@@ ise the potential occurrence of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of mild or moderate inf@@ usion related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of inf@@ usion rate to half of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the event of a single , serious inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
the inf@@ usion can be res@@ um@@ ed with a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of inf@@ usion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used at the same time using chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or pro@@ ca@@ ine because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect negative effects on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over mother &apos;s milk , it is recommended to breast@@ feed with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me during treatment . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were primarily reported as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the phase 3 study and their extension with a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older on a treatment duration of up to 4 years are very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial oils ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study involving a total of 20 patients aged under 5 , with a predominantly severe stroke rate and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version occurred within 3 months of the beginning of the treatment , with a more severe form of ser@@ o@@ con@@ ium in patients aged under 5 ( average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 and over ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or to a premature departure from the study ) 13 / 45 patients were not detected by radio immun@@ op@@ sy ( RI@@ P ) as@@ say det@@ ectable antibodies , among them 3 patients , with whom it never came to ser@@ o@@ con@@ ium . &quot;
&quot; patients with low to low antibody levels reported robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG was detected in the urine . &quot;
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ ginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic tumor activity in vitro which did not appear to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reason for enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pa@@ edi@@ cal therapy lies in an adequate restoration of the enzyme activity in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated medium and the prevention of further accumulation .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from circulation and absorbed by cells into the lymp@@ h no@@ uns , most likely via Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients between 6 and 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received a further 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and ability to function , which is presented in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as indicated in the following table .
the decrease of the FE@@ V expected to be expected is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the total lung volumes increased further in proportion to the size of growing children .
&quot; from the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant drop in the G@@ AG mirror was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) that remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the hetero@@ geneous disease incidence between the patients , which was taken into account through the use of a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes overall for five efficacy variable ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a decrease in 9 patients ( 20 % ) were observed . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion ( 16 patients with the heavy cross @-@ country form and 4 with the middle course ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg because of increased G@@ ag@@ i levels in the urine in week 22 .
&quot; in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) found a normal mental development speed according to Z @-@ Score ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle course @-@ form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with difficult course @-@ form only limited or even no progress was detected in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , investigations on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me dosing regim@@ ens were carried out onto the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a pro@@ vable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions ; however it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years of age was similar to those affected by older and less affected patients .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ time administration , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration and reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data cannot detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; since no tolerance studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines other than those mentioned below 6.@@ 6. &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not immediately used , it is not longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C to be stored , provided the di@@ lution under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;

&quot; within the specified time , the holder of the authorization for the placing of the office has to complete the following study program whose results constitute the basis for the annual assessment report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio . &quot;
this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information for patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data on natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
&quot; for patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase that divi@@ des certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans ) , either in a small amount before or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the components of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have occurred a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion day ( see Section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines please inform your doctor if you are taking drugs that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or pro@@ ca@@ ine , because a possible risk of a decreased effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me exists . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken care of , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
indications for handling - th@@ inner and application The concentrate for producing an inf@@ usion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intra@@ ven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical personnel ) .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; however , in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions arose , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , respir@@ ation , and facial oils . &quot;
&quot; very common ( occurrence at more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • head@@ ache • nau@@ sea • skin r@@ ash • irrit@@ ation • joints , pain in arms and legs • elevated pul@@ ses • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the inf@@ usion site &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available every year , and if necessary , the package will be updated . &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not immediately used , it is not longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C to be stored , provided the di@@ lution under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me inf@@ usion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • first determine the number of di@@ lu@@ ent vi@@ als after body weight of each patient .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have no chemotherapy ( cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread slightly to other parts of the body ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce side effects , patients should take with A@@ lim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and vitamin B@@ 12 inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the application of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti @-@ drug &quot; ( drugs for v@@ om@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluid ) should be given before or after the application of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood type changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be delayed , removed , or the dose is reduced . &quot;
the active form of p@@ emet@@ ry thus slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents cells sharing .
&quot; the transformation of p@@ emet@@ ry into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin were average 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.2 months in the sole administration of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell &apos;s epithel@@ ial cells were given for longer survival times than with the comparative drug . &quot;
September 2004 the European Commission issued Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta across the European Union .
each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.9 % sodium chl@@ oride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary wick sis is taken from the pier@@ cing water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chl@@ oride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - Inf@@ usion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial carcin@@ oma after prior @-@ day chemotherapy , the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of KO@@ F is administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
the reduction of frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions must be given a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids on the day before and on the day after the treatment .
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ re@@ bo@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also need to get intr@@ amus@@ cular inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first p@@ emet@@ ry mixed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving a p@@ emet@@ ry , a complete blood @-@ picture should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te counting . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times of the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place with the consideration of the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood @-@ picture or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients need to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , applying for ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grad 2 Blood .
&quot; should patients not develop non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment must be interrupted with ALI@@ M@@ TA , until the patient has the value before treatment &quot;
treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 doses of doses an hem@@ at@@ ologic Tox@@ ic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort at occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or more than 65 years of age an increased side effect risk exists .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical studies patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min were no dosage adjustments that go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with liver dysfunction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit ( in case of absence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ times of the upper limit ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in studies . &quot;
&quot; patients need to be monitored with respect to bone and p@@ emet@@ ry , before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils again reach a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tic number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te and maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 of hem@@ at@@ ologic and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ og@@ ological toxic@@ ity , such as neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia was be@@ ached when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 was taken place . &quot;
therefore all patients with P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed patients need to be reli@@ ed on fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous taking of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ ics ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ ls@@ i ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , for which a therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ xes is intended , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ time period for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion is to be considered before the p@@ emet@@ ry treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events have occasionally been reported in clinical trials involving p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixes , when this drug is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated living vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this ino@@ cul@@ ation is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; because the possibility of irre@@ versible traum@@ atis@@ ation of reproductive capacity by means of p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixes , men should be advised in front of the treatment command to obtain advice regarding the sperm @-@ conservation . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ ics ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) can lead to a reduced P@@ emet@@ ry mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
caution is advisable when used in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or ac@@ e- t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ de@@ - tens 2 days after the therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ bo@@ xed avoided ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ value such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b are available , the simultaneous application with P@@ emet@@ re@@ bo@@ xed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ emet@@ ry . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring rate of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixes in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected to be used during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; p@@ emet@@ ry can not be used during pregnancy , except when strictly necessary and after careful balancing of benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; because the possibility of irre@@ versible damage of reproductive capacity by means of p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixes , men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice on the sperm account . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ emet@@ ry &apos;s mixed into the mother &apos;s milk and undes@@ irable effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with Mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma and the random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed @-@ held and 163 patients with Mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma who were random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .
&quot; side effects : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) and not known ( based on the available data of Spon@@ tane@@ ous reports ) . &quot;

&quot; for this table , a threshold of 5 % was defined as regards the recording of all events where the reporting physician held a connection with p@@ emet@@ ry and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for possible . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported in &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixes comprised ar@@ rhyth@@ mia and motor neu@@ rop@@ athy .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 265 patients , who were random@@ ised to receive em@@ aci@@ dic and vitamin B@@ 12 as well as 276 patients who random@@ ized doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;

&quot; for this table , a threshold of 5 % was defined as regards the recording of all events where the reporting physician held a connection with p@@ emet@@ ry . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported in &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received random@@ ised p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixes comprised sup@@ rav@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mia .
&quot; clinical relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity level 3 and 4 was similar to Phase 2 for the combined results of three individual P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy studies , excluding neut@@ rop@@ enia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) . &quot;
these differences are likely to result in differences in the patient population because the pha@@ k@@ se 2 studies both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or ab@@ normal initial values of liver function tests are included .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of unwanted effects that could be possible in connection with the study medication ; they were received at &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with N@@ SC@@ LC who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed and received 830 patients with N@@ SC@@ LC who random@@ ised C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine .

&quot; for this table , a threshold of 5 % was established for the inclusion of all events in which the reporting physician had a connection with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
clinical relevant toxic@@ ity that were reported at ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( common ) of patients who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed :
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported in &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received ran@@ - dom@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ xed included :
&quot; serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular occup@@ ants and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks have been reported in cl@@ ini@@ - studies with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixes that are commonly used in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic active substance . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies have occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , intestinal per@@ fo@@ - ration , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ li@@ tis ) . &quot;
&quot; from clinical studies , patients with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed treatment have occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial type of pul@@ mon@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
it was reported about cases of acute ren@@ al failure in P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were treated before or after their p@@ emet@@ ry mixed treatment ( see Section 4.4 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fung@@ ate that breaks its effect by inter@@ rup@@ ting important metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies that P@@ emet@@ re@@ bo@@ xed acts as anti@@ fung@@ ate with several Attack points by blocking the thy@@ me drug syn@@ th@@ ase ( GAR@@ FT ) and Gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( GAR@@ FT ) which are fol@@ ate @-@ dependent enzymes from thy@@ mid@@ in- and pur@@ ul@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ ides .
&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ entre , random@@ ized , simple @-@ blind phase 3 study of ALI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma showed that with ALI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin treated patients had a clin@@ ically significant advantage of a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month prolonged survival against such patients , which were only cau@@ c@@ - d@@ elt with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medication ( random@@ ized and treated ) in the treatment arm .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clinical symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ oma was shown in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared with the sole c@@ is@@ pl@@ ine arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving lung function parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function over time in the control arm .
&quot; a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ised , open Phase III trial with ALI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC after prior chemotherapy occupied patients ( Int@@ ent to treat Population n = 283 ) and from 7.9 months to patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;
&quot; analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival result in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epithel@@ ial hist@@ ological type ( n = 0,@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1,00 , p = 0,0@@ 47 ) , adjusted HR = 1,@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0,0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data of a random@@ ized controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ emet@@ ry between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ parti@@ tioning of ALI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in combination with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
&quot; mean P@@ FS was 4.8 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1,@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1,@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 30.@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 27,@@ 3 - 33.@@ 9 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; the analysis of the influence of N@@ SC@@ LC Hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in the hist@@ ology , see the table below . &quot;
&quot; CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = Int@@ ent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = Size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ sub@@ tl@@ ety , with a total convention interval of HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ le@@ verage limit of 1,17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin needed less trans@@ f@@ usions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28,@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ f@@ usions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te trans@@ f@@ usions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the patients needed the dose of er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ C@@ SF / GM @-@ C@@ SF ( 3.1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0,0@@ 21 ) . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ re@@ xes as a mon@@ otherapy were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tum@@ ors in doses of 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in inf@@ usion regions over a period of 10 minutes .

the resulting solution is clear and the col@@ oring lasts from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish without compromising the quality of the test .
&quot; it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter combined with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , fatty nutrition . &quot;
patients taking All@@ i and after 12 weeks no weight loss can contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they can not reduce some fats in the diet , resulting in about a quarter of the fats led by nutrition in@@ aut the intest@@ ines . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 over@@ weight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in the two studies on patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients receiving All@@ i 60 m@@ g. had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches on after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ d speed , stu@@ d drive , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , leaving o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( f@@ eces ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it should not be applied in patients who are treated with c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it may not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited to appro@@ ve or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; All@@ i is inde@@ xed to weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) , and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ cr@@ ative , fat @-@ induced diet . &quot;
&quot; All@@ i should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , as there is insufficient data for efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , as Or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ized , the dosage is not necessary in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• Sensi@@ tivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Still time ( see Section 4.6 ) • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of occurrence g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken along with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
&quot; since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic monitoring , patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy because the dosage of anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic should be adjusted if necessary . &quot;
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs should be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures in order to prevent possible failure of the oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe di@@ arr@@ he@@ a ( see Section 4.5 ) .
a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma gas was observed in a study on drug interactions and in several cases involving or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
&quot; when applying war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( internationally norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients who have been treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E , and K , as well as beta car@@ ot@@ ene , remained in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , the patient should be advised to take an additional mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the application of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers , who received or@@ list@@ at simultaneously , a minor decrease in A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentrations . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect negative effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal and related to pharmac@@ ological effects of the medicine as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
the incidence of known side effects reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and over@@ weight subjects without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of cases reported after the market launch , there were either no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects caused by the lip@@ ase inhibit@@ ory properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect sets in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ remainder of ga@@ stri@@ c and pancre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ ae .
&quot; clinical studies were derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 confirm the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ cr@@ ative , fat @-@ induced diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , has been evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their basic weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in Gesamt@@ cholester@@ in was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( bas@@ eline value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the mean circum@@ ference was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral dosing of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , not metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be demonstrated spor@@ a@@ dic@@ ally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without any indication of a cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study with obes@@ e patients receiving the minimum systemic res@@ or@@ b@@ ated dose , two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 according to the division of the N @-@ form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , could be identified which represented approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data can no longer detect any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system The owner of the authorization for the placing on the market must ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system , according to the version of July 2007 as described in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application application , is applied and works before and while the product is available on the market . &quot;

&quot; remember to consult your doctor beforehand , if you are not ac@@ custom@@ ed to physical activity . • Stay ab@@ normal while taking and even after the intake of all@@ i . &quot;
&quot; • Al@@ i should not be taken for more than 6 months . • If you can &apos;t find any reduction in weight after twelve weeks of use of all@@ i , please consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice . &quot;
&quot; in certain circumstances , you must stop taking all@@ i . • In case of a successful weight loss , it is not about changing the diet at short notice and then returning to the old habits . &quot;
&quot; • When less than an hour has passed since the last meal , take the intake of the capsule . • If more than an hour has passed since the last meal , take no capsule . &quot;
&quot; flat@@ ul@@ ence with and without the o@@ ily discharge , sudden or increased stool and soft stool ) are due to the mechanism of action ( see section 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; severe allergic reactions • Seri@@ ous allergic reactions occur in the following changes : severe short@@ ness , sweat out@@ breaks , r@@ ashes , it@@ ching , swelling in the face , heart ras@@ en , circul@@ atory collapse . &quot;
29 Very common side effects These can occur in more than 1 of 10 people who are all@@ i . • Ble@@ eding ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) with and without any o@@ ily discharge • Soft chair Inform@@ ative your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of these side effects increases or you considerably com@@ promised .
&quot; • Ga@@ stri@@ c ( abdominal ) pain , • In@@ kontin@@ enz ( stool ) • aqu@@ eous / liquid stool • aug@@ mented / liquid stool • aug@@ mented / fluid stool • Incre@@ ased pace • Ad@@ ditions to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of these side effects increases or you considerably com@@ promised . &quot;
effects on blood tests It is not known how frequently these effects occur . • Incre@@ ase of certain liver enz@@ ym@@ ates • The effects on blood cl@@ ot@@ ting in patients that take war@@ far@@ in or other blood @-@ dil@@ uting ( anti @-@ inflammatory ) drugs .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects may adver@@ sely affect you or notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
the most common side effects depend on the mode of action of the capsules together and thus arise that more and more fat is ex@@ cre@@ ted out of the body .
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first weeks after the beginning of the treatment , as you may not yet have reduced the fat percentage in your diet . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize nutritional intake symptoms : start a few days , or better a week before taking capsules with a fat @-@ induced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fat amount evenly on daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a ta@@ ste@@ ful night table , as you may possibly have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in which these accompanying symptoms occur , learn to control them with time by adapting their diet . &quot;
• Ke@@ ep treatments for children in@@ accessible . • Do not use all@@ i after the exp@@ iry date stated on the box . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel which serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swal@@ low it . • You can carry your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( Shuttle ) which is enclosed in this package .

obesity has an influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • Blood pressure • Diabetes • heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancer treatments • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis speak to your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
&quot; permanent weight loss , for example by improving the diet and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals containing a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ oj@@ ou@@ les , which you also find as indication on food packaging . • Recomm@@ ended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot;
keep in mind the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
&quot; what quantity is suitable for you , refer to the information below that indicates the number of calories suitable for you . • D@@ ue to the mode of action of the capsule is the observ@@ ance of the recommended fat intake . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot handle that amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize the weight loss and at the same time reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of nutritional recei@@ v@@ ables . • You should try to take gradual and continuous weight loss . &quot;
&quot; 34 This dimin@@ ished cal@@ orie intake should enable you to gradually lose weight approximately 0.5 kg per week , without developing fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Less physical activity &quot; means you burn up to 150 k@@ cal daily , i.e. through 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
• For permanent weight loss it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and keep them in . • Re@@ qu@@ ire is a nutrition journal with information on cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • Tr@@ y to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combined the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you to feed cal@@ orie and fatty alcohol and give guidelines to become physically active .
&quot; in combination with a program tailored to your type , this information can help you develop a heal@@ thier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are moderate tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , di@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional administration of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine used as an anti@@ em@@ ic ) .
the application in patients under 18 years is not recommended as there is insufficient information about the effects of this age group .
&quot; this means that the active substance preser@@ ves the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in three main studies , Alo@@ xi was studied in 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or even tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , showed 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate tri@@ ggers for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , showed 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) . &quot;
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 out of 189 patients ) and 53 % for dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 the European Commission approved Helsinki &apos;s Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the marketing of Alo@@ xi within the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in strong em@@ ental chemotherapy due to cancer and v@@ om@@ iting of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ ental chemotherapy due to cancer .
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , induced by a strongly em@@ powered chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on stage , patients should be closely monitored with am@@ nesty for ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable at the same time as Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not supposed to be used either for prevention or treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit tumor activity in pre@@ clinical studies ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , di@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interactions between a single intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration or@@ ginal met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population @-@ based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis it was shown that the simultaneous use of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( di@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ch@@ ini@@ dine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common at a dose of 250 mc@@ g. of observed side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly associated with Alo@@ xi , head@@ ache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the place of performance ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort , and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports . &quot;
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in other dos@@ ages ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to observe .
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , but due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy with an al@@ geri@@ an over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , 1,@@ 132 patients receiving a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1.500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mc@@ g. of dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.4 hours ) were given , given on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intra@@ ven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were given to patients who were given intra@@ ven@@ ously on Day 1 . &quot;
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study of strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron were comparable . &quot;
&quot; after the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion@@ ic channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the EC@@ G effects of mac@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in individual doses of 0,25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption According to intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the complete dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans the average ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
&quot; from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , the total exposure achieved at a once daily intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage of 0.25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable with the value measured after one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the dispos@@ ing of 0.75 mg . &quot;
approximately 40 % are eliminated through the kid@@ neys and about 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites that have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor .
&quot; in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser degree , are involved in iso @-@ enzymes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
elimination After an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine . Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an imm@@ utable ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous lens injection the total body diameter 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; although patients with severe liver dysfunction have increased the terminal elimination threshold and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction in dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only following ex@@ positions , which are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
10 Results of pre@@ clinical studies indicate that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and can pro@@ long the duration of action .
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose was correspon@@ ded in approximately the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which have been given daily over two years , led to an increased incidence of liver tum@@ ors , end@@ oc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , pit@@ u@@ itary cell , secondary ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and da Alo@@ xi is determined in humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is low as for the human being . &quot;
the European Commission must inform the owner of this approval for the placing of the drug in the context of this decision approved by the European Commission .

&quot; June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which the approval of the approval for the marketing of the drug used for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference medicine &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by virus infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ opic examination , the liver tissue damage damages , and the values of the liver enzymes alan@@ ine amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood are ab@@ normal . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates these to the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon submitted data that prove the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
the study was measured according to how many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was treated ( i.e. no evidence of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged
&quot; in addition , concerns were given that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed does not suff@@ ice . &quot;
the number of hepatitis C patients responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
&quot; after setting up the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease re@@ treated more patients than in the case of the reference surgeon . Al@@ ph@@ eon also had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study investigated the question how far the drug is immune to an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not adequately vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected la@@ ges ( cra@@ cks or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or presum@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go may not work against this kind of infection .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but patients under 18 are not allowed to be more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had been cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under plac@@ ebo discussed treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin findings , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response : when the results of both studies were taken together at home customers , about 90 % of patients in both groups responded to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , it was noted that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( egg @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissues ) or infections prov@@ ably or probably caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the job .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks of short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small fir@@ ing , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the marketing of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the event of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine Sal@@ be , treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment must be carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gens or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials with secondary , open wounds the efficacy of retin@@ opathy in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient . &quot;
alternative therapy should be taken into consideration if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected spot occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of retin@@ ulin and other top@@ ical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations achieved in humans after top@@ ical application on sk@@ ewed skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After an oral dose of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on sk@@ ewed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical use in patients , dosage adjustments are not considered necessary if top@@ ical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hibition . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are insufficient in regards to a statement regarding the birth and the fet@@ tal / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
&quot; re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy , when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able in the application of a systemic antibiotic . &quot;
the decision whether breast@@ feeding continues / terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated is between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women .
&quot; in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go used was the most commonly reported secondary effect irrit@@ ation at the place of performance that concerned approximately 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding point of the 50@@ S sub @-@ unit of the bacterial pul@@ p which differs from the binding posts of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding body of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bin@@ ding stelle and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Center .
&quot; by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , partially block P @-@ binding inter@@ activity and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms should appear question@@ able , an expert consultation should be sought by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of a non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption in a healthy adult study , 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment has been taken daily under oc@@ clusi@@ on on intact and slo@@ ped skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma pi@@ geons were obtained . &quot;
sampling occurred within days 3 or 4 in adult patients prior to medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however the maximum individual systemic image of the human being after top@@ ical use of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ ewed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 @-@ times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
&quot; metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ opathy in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily convey@@ ed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with lower participation of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;

the Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; the Ambi@@ rix will be used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while imm@@ uni@@ zation and ensures that the vacc@@ ination plan can be completed in two doses . &quot;
if a refres@@ her dose is desired against hepatitis A or B. Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis A or B vaccine can be given .
&quot; vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , as it can defend itself against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix includes the same components as the vacc@@ ination approved since 1996 Twin@@ rix adults and the vacc@@ ination for Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the use of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
&quot; between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix took a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B. &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix in a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections was similar .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in excess of 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , fatigue , as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals S.@@ a. a permit for the placing on transports of Ambi@@ rix in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; the standardis@@ ation plan for prim@@ di@@ mm@@ ing with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a discovery vacc@@ ination is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ hepatitis B@@ - surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) , are in the same magnitude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; it is not yet fully assured that immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have approached hepatitis A vacc@@ ination need a discovery procedure as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even with no longer det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As for all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units with a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ ert hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in patients with hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels may be achieved , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ination doses may be required . &quot;
&quot; as an in@@ tra @-@ male injection or intr@@ amus@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ etus in the glut@@ eal muscle , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in case of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or co@@ ag@@ ulation distur@@ ban@@ ces , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous as an exception , as in these cases it can come to bleeding after intr@@ amus@@ cular suppl@@ em@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poly@@ ph@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ ent type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , or in patients with immun@@ o@@ deficiency , it has to be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , red@@ ness , swelling , mat@@ ri@@ val@@ ence , g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever is comparable to the frequency observed in the previous thi@@ omer@@ ano@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , Ambi@@ rix &apos;s compatibility with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine was compared . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and quality on a basis of a comp@@ uted dose of Ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis of calculation per person . &quot;
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.7 % of the subjects compared to 39.@@ 1 % in the test persons following the dosage of a dose of 3 @-@ doses @-@ combination vaccine .
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who had received Ambi@@ rix reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ri@@ ence was comparable to a proportion ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle of 39.@@ 6 % of the participants who received the Ambi@@ rix compared to 36.@@ 2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ doses @-@ combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the incidence of pronounced pain and fatigue was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses @-@ vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study at 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old imp@@ fl@@ ingen , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ doses @-@ combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units , and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; however , for the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix there was a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per subject , reported . &quot;
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses @-@ vacc@@ ination schem@@ as with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ I@@ SA@@ - units formally in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not different .
&quot; in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % were 1 month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ HB@@ s ser@@ o@@ version rates were 7@@ 4,@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three cans . &quot;
&quot; for the 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evaluated , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the responses received in a clinical comparative study at 1- to 11 year old one month after the complete vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ ines were either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
&quot; in individuals who were aged between 12 and 15 years of age , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected over at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
the immun@@ ore@@ action observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to those obtained after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be demonstrated that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination diagram .
&quot; when the first dose Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered at the same time with the discovery of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poly@@ ph@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient . &quot;
&quot; a clinical trial , which was conducted with 3 cans of current formulation in adults , showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for the previous formulation . &quot;
the vaccine is examined both before and after the release of the patient for any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

&quot; hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as swimming in water contaminated by wast@@ ewater . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot be fully protected from infection with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ination doses ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or ill / feel ) vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections affecting the liver or causing symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be convey@@ ed .
• if you have already shown an allergic reaction to the Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) with you / your child .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ chy skin r@@ ashes or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you / your child have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • if you / your child have a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usual dosage of the second vaccine ) .
&quot; at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / her child from vacc@@ ination with ambient . &quot;
instead he will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced amounts of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix will be inj@@ ected among people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense / is or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; ambient can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the response to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take another medicine ( including those you can get without any prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated recently or have been given immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) or have planned this in the near future .
&quot; however , in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; normally , Ambi@@ rix is not given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgently needed that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. &quot;
important information about certain other ingredients of Ambi@@ rix please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) with you / your child .
&quot; if you miss the appointment scheduled for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
♦ very frequent ( over 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ inated cans ) : • P@@ ain or dis@@ comfort at penetration or red@@ ness • Mat@@ ousness • irrit@@ ability • head@@ ache • appetite
♦ frequent ( up to 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ inated cans ) : • swelling at the injection point • F@@ ever ( above 38 ° C ) • num@@ b@@ ness • g@@ astro@@ intestinal complaints
&quot; other adverse events , the days or weeks following vacc@@ ination with similar combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B , are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 dec@@ im@@ ated doses ) reported are : &quot;
&quot; these include local limited or expanded r@@ ashes which can be it@@ chy or can be bli@@ stering , swelling of the eyes and face , bru@@ ising breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and un@@ consciousness . &quot;

23 Check your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects you / your child significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this package supplement .
the ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data that has become known since the issu@@ ance of the first permit for the placing on the market , the CH@@ MP assumed that the benefits @-@ risk relationship for the Ambi@@ rix remained positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix remained in circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited because of low patient exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ ia can also be used in pre @-@ history of patients aged over one month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) .
&quot; ammon@@ ia - split into several individual doses to meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a g@@ astro@@ lo@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of the leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; no comparative study was concerned , as ammon@@ ia could not be compared with another treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a head@@ lamp drug , i.e. , no active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ia can also cause appetite loss , a ab@@ normal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , ob@@ s@@ essive , fluid retention , irrit@@ ability , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , unpleasant body od@@ or , or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevents high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; ammon@@ ia was approved under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , &quot; because due to the rar@@ ity of the disease there were only limited information on this medicine at the time of approval . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme defect has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form ( complete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first months of life ) there is an indication of the use when hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy exists in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient for the growth and development . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ eth@@ in@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase .
ar@@ gin@@ ine with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must have ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk of the emergence of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and o@@ dem@@ formation . &quot;
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate over the liver and kid@@ neys is done , AM@@ TH should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ 1@@ s during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation and an increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also a delayed irrit@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in humans is ex@@ cre@@ ted into mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ 1@@ s is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ TH , 56 % of patients had at least one undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were considered that they were not associated with AM@@ TH . &quot;
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ or@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate glasses , severe hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of an over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month old inf@@ ant with an accidental dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity during intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound that con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kid@@ neys .
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ con@@ amin can be compared with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ lu@@ glut@@ amine can therefore be used as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen . &quot;
5 patients with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen for each gram .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcomes .
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of early manifest@@ ations of the disease with on@@ set of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ant , and the disease even led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alogues within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; through hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen removal ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl acet@@ ate ) , protein reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life month ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time with many too mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its . &quot;
patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ otic form of the or@@ ni@@ m@@ trans@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) who were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein @-@ reduced diet were 98 % survival rate .

&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is ox@@ idi@@ zed into phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in the liver and kid@@ neys with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ con@@ glut@@ amine is created . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in a so@@ ber healthy adult and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; in the majority of patients with urine cycle disorders or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma was det@@ ectable in the next morning after no@@ c@@ turn@@ al fasting . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma gas were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mon@@ os@@ o@@ dium glut@@ amine .
&quot; after the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at had no ration@@ alized effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at is either taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children who cannot swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or a g@@ astro@@ lo@@ stom@@ ia or a nas@@ al probe . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in plasma should be held within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ eth@@ in@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gar@@ net contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; if rat fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex came to les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ or@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate glasses , severe hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ y@@ top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ con@@ amin can be compared with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ con@@ amin is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fat &quot;
&quot; on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ mon@@ os@@ o@@ dium glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it may be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly re@@ versible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition may occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral dose of 5 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ule form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure contains the small measuring spo@@ on 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spo@@ on 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on of 8,@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ 1@@ o. may also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so they can not ex@@ crete the nit@@ ro@@ genous waste products which accum@@ ulate after eating proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ 1@@ o. since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate may influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you take AM@@ TH products with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken care of , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , you may not take AM@@ MONA@@ PS as the medicine may pass into mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , head@@ ache , taste distur@@ ban@@ ces , decrease of the hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory distur@@ ban@@ ces and a deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions have also been observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , please contact your doctor or emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating an appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you forget the intake of AM@@ 1@@ s , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;

&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example , with un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest of varying thick@@ nesses ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) ( an an@@ om@@ al measured value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; when applied to preventing blood cl@@ ots in patients entering a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the inf@@ usion can continue up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on AC@@ S treatment , in which the effect of an@@ gi@@ ox has been compared or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) and compared to a GP@@ I with conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ x@@ ima@@ b and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift from GP@@ I - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year in total as effective as traditional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who undergo a PCI , an@@ gi@@ ox in relation to all indicators was as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , other her@@ ds@@ men or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for he@@ par@@ in during AC@@ S treatment and during one PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is carried out in a further sequence , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the inf@@ usion is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical necessity . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a dosage of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an immediate intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us administration of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI interference is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shor@@ tened to less than 225 seconds , a second bol@@ us should be 0.3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ formed and dil@@ uted drugs should be bl@@ ended carefully before the application and the stu@@ d dosage can be administered intra@@ ven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second dose of 0,3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose of the bolt will be re @-@ examined . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI trial ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which were included , the ACT was 5 minutes after the application of the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients an@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with an@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the end of the intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ized he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular le@@ par@@ in .
• Seri@@ ous hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredients or against her@@ m@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ o@@ bi@@ al system and / or irre@@ versible cereb@@ ral end@@ o@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if the majority of bleeding in arter@@ ial punc@@ ture points occur in case of PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din , there may be bleeding in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) during treatment . &quot;
patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din should consider monitoring the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine once again reaches the level before treatment .
&quot; based on the knowledge about the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te Aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ itation or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ id parameters in each case are regularly checked . &quot;
&quot; the animal experiments are insufficient in terms of effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din alone , 4@@ 604 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ira @-@ Group and in the comparative groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , it occurred more frequently in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding was defined according to the A@@ cu@@ ity and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding such as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
&quot; an A@@ cu@@ ity severe bleeding has been defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding centre , re@@ operation due to hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed blood loc@@ ali@@ zations that occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; points of position , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
the following information on side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din in 6000 patients under@@ going PCI .
&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine group and the comparative groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes listed in Table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ira is immediately broken off and the patient closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ atic inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and the ion binding region of thro@@ mb@@ ine , regardless of whether thro@@ mb@@ in is bound in liquid phase or t@@ inn@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; binding from Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is re@@ versible , because in its part , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thus re@@ generating the function of the active center of thro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there was no thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) to indu@@ ce thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia and thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ ira shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent an@@ tic@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect obtained by the extension of ACT , a@@ P@@ TT , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was carried out in the following cases , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5mg / kg bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din should be given and the inf@@ usion is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
in the arm A of the A@@ cu@@ ity study un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ mid@@ market ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either prior to angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or PCI .
&quot; in the A@@ cu@@ ity study , the characteristics of high risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the 3 arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ar@@ kers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients under@@ gone a angi@@ ography within 72 hours . &quot;

clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ob@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ ine were evaluated in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) and in patients with AC@@ S .
it is expected that Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din as a pep@@ tide enters into his amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent re@@ valuation of the amino acids in the body pool .
&quot; due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic centre of thro@@ mb@@ in , the primary metabolism that results from the separation of the N @-@ terminal sequence through thro@@ mb@@ in is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic centre of thro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
elimination occurs in patients with normal ren@@ al function after a first order process with a half @-@ duration of 25 ± 12 minutes .
&quot; based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproduction toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data cannot detect any particular haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
the toxic@@ ity of animals in repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks with exposure to 10 @-@ fa@@ eces of the clinical @-@ state plasma concentration ) was limited to super@@ imposed pharmac@@ ological effects .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need insulin treatment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the upper arm , or as a permanent inf@@ usion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugars ) in the blood or unable to handle insulin effectively .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin differenti@@ ates very slightly from human insulin and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter time of action than a short @-@ acting human insulin analog insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , in which the body of insulin could not be processed effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was to change the concentration of gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes was observed after six months a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin progression .
in adults with type 2 diabetes the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.30 % in human normal insulin analog insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission approved the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH appro@@ ving the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h , or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous inf@@ usion into the area of abs . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin response , insulin demands can be reduced in patients with a restriction of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active strength , the brand , the type of insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zin@@ k@@ lag , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can undergo a change in the insulin sensi@@ bility . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dosage or absence of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
the change@@ over of a patient to another type of insulin or insulin of another manufacturer should be conducted under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage required .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment regim@@ en .
&quot; the substances that can increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias include oral anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , do@@ x@@ if@@ y@@ ll@@ ene , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; additionally , under the effect of sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic medications such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and Reser@@ pins , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c anti@@ regulation may be weak@@ ened or missing . &quot;
&quot; animal studies on reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin related to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin enters into human breast milk , but in general insulin is not absorbed into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral application . &quot;
&quot; the following are listed in clinical trials dispos@@ ed of undes@@ irable medications , group@@ ed by system organ@@ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;

&quot; Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ ph@@ ie Will negl@@ ect to change the injection site continuously within the injection area , can result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by a correspon@@ d@@ ingly trained person or by an intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of glucose by a doctor .
&quot; after glu@@ ing injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primary cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially by skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) and the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that during sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin the impact occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin insulin .
&quot; in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus , insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin showed a dose of propor@@ tion@@ ately glu@@ co@@ sis effect , and 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in the glu@@ cos@@ lens effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ izing effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; the data showed that in an application of insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal , a similar post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; received insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ cal control than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal , was achieved . &quot;
&quot; insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a similar gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - gro@@ oves before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) , is achieved . &quot;
&quot; insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal in comparison with human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin at gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human Nor@@ - mal@@ insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
