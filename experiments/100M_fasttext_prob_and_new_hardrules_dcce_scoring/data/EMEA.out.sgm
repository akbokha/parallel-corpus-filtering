<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of tablets (tablets which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. wirl thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I-disturbance, a mental disorder in which the patients alternate manic episodes (periods of anormaler high mood) alternately with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe episodes and to prevent some episodes in patients who have approached the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased unrest or behavioural disturbances if the oral consumption of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used for inserting or smelting tablets in patients receiving difficulty swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"for patients who use other medicines at the same time, the same as abilify Abilify, the dose of abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably appears as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for neurotransmitter dopamine and 5 hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole is like 5 hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in a lesser degree the neurotransmitters work to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps normalize the activity of the brain causing mental or manic symptoms to be reduced and their re-occurrence is prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify, to prevent recurrence of symptoms, has been studied in three studies over a year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased anxiety over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients in which the manic symptoms have already been stabilized with abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study involving 301 patients with bipolar disorder, suffering from increased anxiety, with which Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medicine) and placebo were compared to a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the patient's symptoms was examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to investigate how the body resorbs the smelting tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution showed patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-time studies."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo for the re-occurrence of some episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg cans also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled), sedation (constipation), cerebral hypersecretion (increased saliva production), fatigue and fatigue, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in schizophrenia and severe some episodes in bipolar I disorder and the prevention of a new manic episode in patients with Aripiprazole were predominant compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with some episodes of bipolar I disorder, if oral therapy is not appropriate, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the trafficking of Abilify across the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes responded to treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for abilify amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient population, a lower initial dose should be taken into consideration when clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 induction is derived from combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorder, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no elevated risk of suicide in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with known cardio-vascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, cardiac insufficiency), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are used for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including aczelerated and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="39">"when treated with Abilify, signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesia occur should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a brain, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of brain, all antipsychotics, including abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at states that are related to seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years old with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, had an increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant correlation between dosage and response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events associated with abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs treated patients who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly regarding worsening glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia and in patients with bipolar disorder, the use of anti-psychotics, in which weight gain is known as side-effects, or an unhealthy lifestyle, and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally acting drugs with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist family, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects, and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolism, the joint application with highly effective inhibitors from CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism."</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with abilify the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, like Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects, and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after passing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose-height before the beginning of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 to be administered together with Abilify can be expected with a moderate increase in the Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan-Ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data security situation in humans and the concerns originated in animal reproductive studies, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justifies clearly the potential risk for the foetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazol has no negative influence on them."</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) as under placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">"the frequency of adverse events described below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100)."</seg>
<seg id="63">"schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks, in patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akhaze, Dystonia and Dyskinesia were compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%)."</seg>
<seg id="64">"in a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy."</seg>
<seg id="66">Some episodes of Bipolar-I-disturbance - In a controlled trial over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients under Aripiprazol- Treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">"in another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS is 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment."</seg>
<seg id="68">"in the long-term maintenance phase for over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="69">"a comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potential clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred, showed no medically significant differences."</seg>
<seg id="70">"CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with arias, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"the side effects reported in connection with an antipsychotic therapy include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia, and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional acute overdoses with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in treating an overdose with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is useful in the treatment of an overdose, since Aripiprazol has a high plasma protein bandaging."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is suspected that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D3 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptor.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripiprazole showed a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and a serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to the Dopamine D4-, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to the alpha-1-adrenergic and the histamine H1receptor."</seg>
<seg id="76">"in the application of Aripiprazole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks in healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at Nucleus caudatus and at the putative."</seg>
<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a semi-opidol-controlled trial, 52% of respondents were responsive in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%)."</seg>
<seg id="79">"current values of measured values defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and Montgomery Asminence rates, showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled trial for over 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher rate of response was seen for Aripiprazole, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% among placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study goal was' weight gain ', a weight gain of at least 7% compared with the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg) in an average weight of ca."</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I-disorder Aripiprazole showed an effective efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy against placebo in a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed an effective efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazol also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which partially over 2 weeks did not lie on lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirror, the companion therapy with Aripiprazole showed a superior efficacy in reducing some symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled trial for over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase prior to randomisation, Aripiprazole was considering the prevention of bipolar retroactivity mainly in the prevention of a regression into the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the Dehydration and Hydroxylic of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkyellation is catalyzed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination of elimination is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole on extensive metabolism of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolism over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazol there are no differences in the pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenia patients showed no gender-dependent effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">A Popular-specific analysis of the pharmacokinetics did not indicate clinically significant differences in the ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not recognize any particular dangers to humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions, which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent non-alcoholic toxicity (Lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3-10 times the average Steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">"in addition, a cholelithiasis as a consequence of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the bile after repetitive oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day was established (1-3 times the average Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81times of the recommended maximum dose in people based on mg / m2)."</seg>
<seg id="98">"however, the concentrations found in human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- aripiprazole not more than 6% of concentrations observed in the study over 39 weeks in Galle of monkeys, and lie far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro-solubility."</seg>

<seg id="301">"since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual incidence are possible and no causal connection with these events was established."</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubules substance that promotes the accumulation of the microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibiting their decoloration.</seg>
<seg id="303">"this stabilization leads to a inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions."</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and within the framework of in-vitro studies has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is conveyed through the gp-60 albuminreceptor and because of the albumuminated protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumour.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast carcinoma is supported by 106 patients in two single-armed unblinded studies and 454 patients treated in a randomized Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">"in one study, 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2."</seg>

<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or wedge binding from paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared with the values after a 3-hour intravenous injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">"the Clearance of paclitaxel was higher (43%) after the Abraxane administration (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%)."</seg>
<seg id="321">In published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers it is reported that paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">"after a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, the mean value for cumulative ic excretion was 4% of the total total dose of 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3" -p hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal Clearance.

<seg id="753">"this means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level drops, whereby type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="754">"in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in triplegic was studied; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyresin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years."</seg>

<seg id="864">"Actraphane was studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the pancreas can not produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively."</seg>
<seg id="865">"in the study, after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set."</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror that indicated that the blood sugar levels were significantly reduced as with another human insulin insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Acrophane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">"in addition, the doses of acetone may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (the complete list is to remove the package contents)."</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Actraphane outweigh the risks in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">October 2002 the European Commission issued a permit for the company Novo Nordisk A / S to introduce Actraphane to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">"for example, patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly by an intensified insulin therapy can change the hypoglycaemia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly."</seg>
<seg id="874">"any change in terms of starch, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNA opposite insulin of animal origin) may cause a change in dosage."</seg>
<seg id="875">"if a dose adjustment is required when changing to Actraphane in the patient, it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion."</seg>
<seg id="876">"some patients, in which hypoglycemic reactions after a change of animal to human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin."</seg>
<seg id="877">"before travelling, going over several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used and taken at other times."</seg>
<seg id="878">"for this reason, the doctor must consider possible interactions during the therapy and always consult his patients after other medicines taken by them."</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia which can occur in a non-controlled diabetestherapy increase the risk of deformities and fruit death in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemias may lead to unconsciousness and / or convulsions and end with temporary or permanent disorders of brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Disorders of the nervous system Gels - Peripheral neuropathy A quick improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are referred to as acute pain neuropathy and are usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5 An intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in blood sugar setting can however be associated with a temporary decrease in diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Diseases of the skin and the breathable tissue Gelally - Lipodystrophy at the injection point may develop a lipodystrophy if failed to switch the incisions within the injection area.</seg>
<seg id="884">"public hypersensitivity reactions at the injection point during insulin therapy can occur local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and hematoma at the injection site)."</seg>
<seg id="885">"diseases of the immune system gel-free - Urticaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylaktic reactions symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity, including generalized skin rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angioneurotropic oil, palpitations, low blood pressure and powerlessness / unconsciousness."</seg>
<seg id="886">"however, hypoglycemia can be gradually developed: • Light glycemias can be treated through the oral supply of glucose or sugary foods."</seg>
<seg id="887">"therefore, diabetics should always have grape vines, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Heavy Hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) through a proven aid person or through glucose that is given intravenously by the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="888">"the effect begins within half an hour, the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours."</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of cleavage (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the cleavage are active.</seg>
<seg id="891">"based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and the reproductive-toxicity, preclinical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans."</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after the acetophane piercing bottle was taken out of the fridge - increase the temperature of the insulin to room temperature (not above 25 ° C) before it is resuscitated according to the operating instructions for the first use.</seg>
<seg id="893">"some patients, in which hypoglycemic reactions after a change of animal to human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin."</seg>

<seg id="1277">"in order to avoid irritation of the esophagus, the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day that should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"since Alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union, the company presented data obtained from previous studies and published literature."</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of ADROVANCE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"after a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those who received exclusively alendronate (32%)."</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data that suggest that the Alendronat dose contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (diarrhoea), flatulence (swelling), irritated abdomen (bloated abdomen) as well as sucking clutches."</seg>
<seg id="1283">"in patients with hypersensitivity (allergy) against alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other components ADROVANCE may not be applied."</seg>

<seg id="1288">The following hints are to be observed exactly to reduce the risk of malignant irritation and associated side effects (see Section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after the day. • The patients should not chew the tablet or break the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcera. • The patients should not lie before the first dietary intake of the day that should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>

<seg id="1293">"3 The risk of serious ophageal side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms, which indicate an esophageal irritation."</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">"while in large-scale clinical trials with alendronate no increased risk was found, stomach and duodenal ulcera, among them some severe and with complications, were reported (see section 4.8)."</seg>

<seg id="1302">"alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may impair the absorption of alendronate when taken at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore patients need to wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronat before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">"although specific interaction studies were not carried out, alendronate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines, without clinically relevant interactions."</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended only for use in post-menopausal women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breastfeeding women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">"animal studies with alendronate do not indicate directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development."</seg>

<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of flu virus which could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">"a influenza pandemic breaks out when a new stem of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from man to man, because people have no immunity (no protection) on the other hand."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"after the vaccine is approved, the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as" "foreign" "and forms antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"as a result, the immune system will later be able to produce faster antibodies in contact with a influenza virus."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"subsequently, the diaphragm of the virus with the" surface antigens "(proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognizes as body-alien) was disconnected, stirred up and used as part of the vaccine."</seg>
<seg id="1900">Inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">"as a result, the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine is insufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for prepandemic vaccines."</seg>

<seg id="1903">"if you would like more information regarding the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR)."</seg>
<seg id="1904">"it is used in combination with other anti-viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years, infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)."</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for patients who cannot swallow the capsules, asthma is available as a solution to intake, but it cannot be taken together with Ritonavir as the safety of this combination was not studied."</seg>
<seg id="1906">"asgenerase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked out which antiviral drugs the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood of the virus is addressed to the drug."</seg>
<seg id="1907">"the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with twice daily 100 mg ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of asgenera is based on body weight."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"in combination with other antiviral medicines, asgenera reduces the amount of blood in the blood and keeps them at a low level."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"aids not cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of associated infections and diseases."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"asgenera was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adult adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"this high-dose Ritonavir reinforced drug Agenerase was compared with 206 adults, who previously had protease inhibitors, compared to other protease inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">"in studies with patients who had previously not taken a protease inhibitor, more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml compared to placebo after 48 weeks, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir."</seg>
<seg id="1915">"in children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, although of the children who previously had been treated with protease inhibitors, only very few responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1916">"in the study with adults who previously had been treated with protease inhibitors, the drugs called Ritonavir increased the viral load after 16-week treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:"</seg>
<seg id="1917">"in the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, it came to a stronger decrease in the viral load after four weeks than with the patients receiving their previously protease inhibitors:"</seg>
<seg id="1918">"the most common side effects of asthma (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence, nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue)."</seg>

<seg id="1922">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Ageneric drugs used in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years have prevailed against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Agenerase is usually taken along with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of asgenera in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously did not have protease inhibitors has not been proven."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"Agenerase was originally licensed under" "exceptional circumstances", "since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"in October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited a permit for the marketing of asgenera across the European Union."</seg>

<seg id="1928">The use of Amprenavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and pre-treatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from Amprenavir as capsule; therefore Atherase capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for asthma capsules is 600 mg Amprenavir twice a day together with 100 mg ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"2 If asgenerase capsules are applied without the amplifying addition of Ritonavir (boosters), higher doses of asgenera (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for asgenerase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">"the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asthma in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children."</seg>
<seg id="1934">Asgenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">"based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"the simultaneous application is to be performed in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, they are contraindicated (see section 4.3)."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"asgenera must not be given simultaneously with medicines, which have a low therapeutic width and also represent the substrates of the cytochrom P450-Isoenzenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4)."</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a decreased therapeutic effect of Amprenavir while taking Amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that asthma or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The present antiretroviral therapy including treatment with asthma does not prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>

<seg id="1944">Patients with previously restricted liver function including chronic-active hepatitis have demonstrated an increased incidence of liver dysfunctions under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"simultaneous use of asgenerase and ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocortical oids, which are metabolized via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the possible benefits of a treatment predominate systemic corticosteroids, including morbus Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"since the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors lovastatin and Simvastatin is highly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of asgenera with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended due to the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis."</seg>

<seg id="1948">"for patients taking this medicine at the same time, asgenera can be less effective because of reduced plasma pivots (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="1949">"due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Amprenavir the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"if methadone is given to Amprenavir at the same time, patients should therefore be monitored on opium removal symptoms, especially if even low doses of Ritonavir are given."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"due to the potential risk of a toxicity due to the high propylene glycolon content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups."</seg>

<seg id="1957">"in HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections, leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening symptoms."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"although a multifactorial aetiology is accepted (including use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, higher Body-Mass-Index), cases of osteonosis were reported in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART)."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase must not be given at the same time with medicines, which have a low therapeutic width and also represent the substrates of the cytochrom P450-Isoenzenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4)."</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir must not be combined with medicines whose agents are mainly metabolized via CYP2D6 and are associated with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of Amprenavir which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>

<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma produced twice daily with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">"dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, a close-meshed surveillance is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known."</seg>
<seg id="1971">"no pharmacokinetic study was carried out in combination with didanosine in combination with didanosine, however, due to the fantasy component of didanosine, it is recommended that the revenues of didanosine and asgenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below)."</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for this reason, in the case of Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dosage adjustment is required."</seg>
<seg id="1973">Efavirenz treatment in combination with Amprenavir and Saquinavir is not recommended since the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be lower.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggests that nevirapin reduces the serum concentration of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">"if these drugs should be used at the same time, be cautious as Delavirdin may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutical plasma gas."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"if these drugs are used together, caution is advised; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be undertaken as an exact prediction of the effect of the combination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirine is difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous dosage of Amprenavir and Rifabutin resulted in a rise in plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193% and thus to an increase in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">"if it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in dosage of rifabuine is recommended at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available."</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with asthma in combination with erythromycin were not carried out but the plasma of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of two daily 700 mg of Fetoconazole with 200 mg ketoconazole on a daily basis resulted in an increase of CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2.69x compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg of ketoconazole once daily without simultaneous use of fritonavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">"other medicines that are listed below, among them also substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, can, if used together with Agenerase, may cause interactions."</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these medicines when applied in combination with asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1983">"based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids do not be used at the same time as asthma as it may result in respiratory disorders."</seg>
<seg id="1984">"the simultaneous use of anti-convulsions known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with Amprenavir can result in a degradation of the plasma gas of Amprenavir."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"the serum levels of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipine and Verapamil can be increased by Amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of this drug."</seg>
<seg id="1986">"simultaneous ingestion with asthma can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and intensify with PDE5 inhibitors related side effects including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1987">"in a clinical trial, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma was decreasing by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%)."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"as a result, the simultaneous use of asgenera with Ritonavir together with these glucocorticosteroids is not recommended unless the possible use of a treatment predominates the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1989">"HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as lovastatin and simvastatin, whose metabolization is highly dependent on CYP3A4, are pronounced increases in plasma gas at the same time as agenerase."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"since plasma gas levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors lead to myopathy including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these medicines is not recommended with Amprenavir."</seg>
<seg id="1991">"a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations until stabilization of the mirror is recommended, as the plasma concentrations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased while using Amprenavir (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1992">"therefore, asgenera must not be applied together with oral-absorbed Midazolam (see Section 4.3) while caution is recommended while using asgenera with parenteral midazolam."</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma piping of Midazolam around 3 to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">"if methadone is administered together with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opium removal symptoms, especially if even low doses of Ritonavir are given."</seg>
<seg id="1995">"because of the very low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can be given at the moment, as the Amprenavir- dose is to be adjusted when Amprenavir is administered at the same time with methadone."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"while using warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with asgenera, increased control of INR (International Normalised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening of the antitheromatic effect (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"the effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods of contraception are recommended."</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended at the same time as Agenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally in the complete dose range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous dosage of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 cans the average (± SD) increase in Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">"from pharmacokinetic simulations, the total exposure achieved at a once daily intravenous dosage of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was comparable with the value measured after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAx was higher after the disposing of 0.75 mg."</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated through the kidneys and about 50% are converted into two primary metabolites that have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">"in-vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lesser degree, are involved in iso-enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 on the metabolism of Palonosetron."</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine. Palonosetron as an immutable ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>

<seg id="2644">"although patients with severe liver dysfunction have increased the terminal elimination threshold and the average systemic exposure to palonosetron, however, a reduction in dose is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"in pre-clinical trials, effects were observed only following expositions, which are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Results of preclinical studies indicate that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations that are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and can prolong the duration of action.</seg>

<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after setting up the treatment with Alpheon, the disease retreated more patients than in the case of the reference surgeon. Alpheon also had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test used in the study investigated the question how far the drug is immune to an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), not adequately validated."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used to treat impetigo (skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected lages (cracks or cuts), abrasions and sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against this kind of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but patients under 18 are not allowed to be more than 2% of the body surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin findings, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response: when the results of both studies were taken together at home customers, about 90% of patients in both groups responded to treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in these two studies, however, it was noted that Altargo is not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (egg-filled cavities in the body tissues) or infections provably or probably caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is an irritation at the job.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the risks of short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small firing, abrasions or sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission issued Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the marketing of Altargo throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in the event of a sensitization or severe local irritation by the use of Retapamine Salbe, treatment should be aborted, the ointment must be carefully wiped and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started."</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not intended to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogens or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in clinical trials with secondary, open wounds the efficacy of retinopathy in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient."</seg>

<seg id="2698">"mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus)."</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding point of the 50S sub-unit of the bacterial pulp which differs from the binding posts of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding body of ribosomal protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-Binding stelle and the Peptidyltransferase Center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"by binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, partially block P-binding interactivity and prevent normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of Retapamulin at least some infection forms should appear questionable, an expert consultation should be sought by experts."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"there were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in case of a non-response to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>

<seg id="2891">The recommended initialdosage of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"if a PCI is carried out in a further sequence, an additional Bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"according to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical necessity."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"immediately before the procedure, a dosage of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention."</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intravenous dosage of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an immediate intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single bolus administration of Angiox has not been examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI interference is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"if this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolus should be 0.3 mg / kg / body weight."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reformed and diluted drugs should be blended carefully before the application and the stud dosage can be administered intravenously."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"as soon as the ACT is more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1,75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with Bivaliruine against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second dose of 0,3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose of the bolt will be re-examined."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"in patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in the phase III- PCI trial (REPLACE-2), which were included, the ACT was 5 minutes after the application of the bivalirudin-bolus without dosage adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">The treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the end of the intravenous administration of unfractionized heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low molecular leparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• Serious hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredients or against hermudine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a disturbance of the hemobial system and / or irreversible cerebral endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">"patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when Bivaliruine is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"even if the majority of bleeding in arterial puncture points occur in case of PCI patients under Bivalirudin, there may be bleeding in patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) during treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2908">Patients receiving warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin should consider monitoring the INR value (International Normalised Ratio) to ensure that the value after settling the treatment with Bivaliruine once again reaches the level before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"based on the knowledge about the mechanism of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytic or Thrombocyte Aggregationshemmer), it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"in the combination of bivaliruine with thrombocyte agitation or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostaid parameters in each case are regularly checked."</seg>
<seg id="2911">"the animal experiments are insufficient in terms of effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3)."</seg>
<seg id="2912">"4612 were randomised to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractional Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa Inhibitor."</seg>
<seg id="2913">"in both the Bivalira-Group and in the comparative groups treated with heparin, it occurred more frequently in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients."</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to the Acuity and Timi standards for severe bleeding such as in the footnotes of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa-Inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / III- Inhibitor (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">"an Acuity severe bleeding has been defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or hemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding centre, reoperation due to hemorrhage, application of blood products to transfusion."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"other, less frequently observed blood localizations that occurred with more than 0.1% (occasionally) were" other "points of position, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck."</seg>

<seg id="2921">"the following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped according to system organclasses listed in Table 6."</seg>
<seg id="2922">"in case of an overdose, the treatment with Bivalira is immediately broken off and the patient closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2923">"Angiox contains bivaliruine, a direct and specific thromatic inhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic centre and the ion binding region of thrombine, regardless of whether thrombin is bound in liquid phase or tinned."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"binding from Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because in its part, Thrombin regenerates the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, thus regenerating the function of the active center of thrombin."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"in addition, there was no thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) to induce thrombocytopenia and thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) in the past."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"in healthy volunteers and in patients, Bivalira shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect obtained by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"if a PCI was carried out in the following cases, an additional Bolus of 0.5mg / kg bivalirudin should be given and the infusion is increased to 1.75mg / kg / h."</seg>

<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivaliruine were evaluated in patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudin as a peptide enters into his amino acid constituents with subsequent revaluation of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">"due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic centre of thrombin, the primary metabolism that results from the separation of the N-terminal sequence through thrombin is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic centre of thrombin."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need insulin treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm, or as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugars) in the blood or unable to handle insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-lulisin differentiates very slightly from human insulin and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter time of action than a short-acting human insulin analog insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in type 2 diabetes, in which the body of insulin could not be processed effectively, Apidra was examined in a study involving 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was to change the concentration of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes was observed after six months a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin progression.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin analog insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin-lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who already suffer from hypoglycemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission approved the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH approving the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh, or the delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion into the area of abs."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin response, insulin demands can be reduced in patients with a restriction of the liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change of the active strength, the brand, the type of insulin (normal, NPH, zinklag, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can undergo a change in the insulin sensibility."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An insufficient dosage or absence of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life-threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient to another type of insulin or insulin of another manufacturer should be conducted under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage required.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"the substances that can increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase propensity to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin converting enzyme (MAO) inhibitors, doxifyllene, propoxyphs, salizylates and sulfonamide antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"additionally, under the effect of sympathetic medications such as beta blockers, Clonidine, Guanethidin and Reserpins, the symptoms of adrenergic antiregulation may be weakened or missing."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"animal studies on reproductive-toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin related to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3)."</seg>

<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) which is given by a correspondingly trained person or by an intravenous dose of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after gluing injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the primary cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially by skeletal musculature and fat) and the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that during subcutaneous Ga- be of insulin-lulisin the impact occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than at hu- manem normal insulin insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- tus, insulin-lulisin showed a dose of proportionately glucosis effect, and 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in the glucoslens effect, just like human insulin."</seg>
