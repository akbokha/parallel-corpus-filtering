&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated in place of the entire &amp; URL . &quot;
&quot; machine translations are only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case Bab@@ el@@ fish produces a coarse translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , the translations do not make important decisions depending on the translation . &quot;
&quot; only web pages on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated to the Bab@@ el@@ fish website itself , where you can paste texts into translation directly . &quot;
package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite their small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions by &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier available .
for more information on using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions you will find in the manual for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules at &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select Pre@@ ferences Exten@@ sions ... Open the card map tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list with default setting modules from the package k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that maybe more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before comp@@ iling this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras Transfers . then you can view the page that has &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or the list of crashes , if available , delete . &quot;
the module An@@ gle filter ( also called folder filters ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras An@@ view Fil@@ ters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ Element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node . &quot;
module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various tool@@ bars and text views in order to view the content of your local file system .
tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rec@@ t@@ angle whose surface is propor@@ tion@@ ate to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file or folder shows the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily recognized even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View can be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are viewing . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ k representation is a rec@@ t@@ angle represented by a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rectang@@ les have meaningful color and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rec@@ t@@ angle that is switched over view color mode can be either deep for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the illustration of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rec@@ t@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each feature , you can specify if there is enough space to display ( where there is sufficient space for representation ) . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rec@@ t@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; in case of representation algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the item . frames are drawn to represent the ne@@ sting of entries , and this frame will require space , which will then no longer be available to the subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rec@@ t@@ angle is square . &quot;
&quot; as spl@@ itting the space of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries takes place , the implementation remains to be left to the implementation . in this case it is advisable for the labelling and avo@@ idance of space losses due to frame always advantageous to create rectang@@ les that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive division . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum presented area for an entry over the menu item View An@@ ders by area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ox application .
the module image gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras photo gallery ... or with Ctr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you call the module image gallery , a dialog opens , with which you can set the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the gallery page in a text input field .
the images per line have a slider and a rotation field to set the number of mini@@ atures of each line in the gallery .
&quot; to display the image name of the image , specify if the file names are shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; to display the file size of the image , specify if the file size is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the image size check box , you specify whether the size of images below the thumb@@ nails is displayed in the gallery . &quot;
in the Di@@ alogue folder you specify where the gallery is saved and which sub @-@ folders should be included .
&quot; in the file selection , Save in HTML file , specify where the HTML page should be saved . &quot;
&quot; with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set up with a slider or a shooting field until which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot;
copy original images to the gallery using the original images to copy the original images to the gallery .
you can add a comment file for cap@@ turing the images in the gallery using the Comments box .
&quot; in the Custom color depth in the check box , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails as in the original images . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings provides you with easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
you will find media playback for the navigation pane in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; View menu under Windows Navigation Pan@@ e or with the short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
&quot; to play , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area ; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback . &quot;
change browser detection adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; added which allows you to change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is helpful for websites that allow access only with specific browsers .
&quot; default browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a web page that deny access to this browser , change browser detection in one of the following options . &quot;
change the code in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that reject access with browsers based on Mozilla . you need for example the M@@ SI@@ E browser detection to call up with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are correctly displayed with the identification of this out@@ dated browser .
&quot; with this option , the default browser detection is used for all pages of the site you are currently visiting . &quot;
with the menu entry App@@ ly ... you can set the scope of the information about the used browser and the operating system in the individual .

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ . ; of course , each medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ back ; work together . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fs ; contains a fast image processing with basic image processing tools . you can use it to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( Manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by means of li@@ bra@@ w , DNG export and ICC color management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or lens to search for . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam , an open source project . that means it depends on supporting the end @-@ users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement opportunities . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fs ; tries to make mel@@ ds of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the help menu provides an entry problems or wishes ... This opens a dialog with a under@@ lined connection . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . all necessary information is already recorded here . please follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is a project that is supported by a community . i.e. , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to answer questions about other users here . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
you can also check out the digi@@ ti@@ zed homepage to get news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; the best start to get involved &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to participate , registration is in the developer mailing list . instructions for reporting in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . &quot;
&quot; when you start &amp; check ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a path name or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path will remain the same for all image folders . &quot;
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you will additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings digi@@ K@@ am set up collections
&quot; if you already have a collection of images on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder containing pictures as base folders . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fs ; see each sub@@ folder as an album . no image is changed . while browsing the folder , you will get a progress report like this : &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; dur@@ ably recur@@ sively the library path in its enti@@ rety . you cannot exclude sub@@ folders unless it i@@ ste in hidden folders . this lets you insert ex@@ hal@@ bs &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fs ; do this by inser@@ ting one point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
&quot; if you are taking an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set in &amp; digi@@ amp ; set up your digital camera . then , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Keys to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; may also deal with it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu . &quot;
how to set this up and work with raw files is described in sections of raw decoder settings and raw processing .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ . ; of course , each medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ back ; work together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera is then released as a USB mass storage device . the camera can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fs ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial port for communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transm@@ issions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images using g@@ Photo@@ 2 . see this link for a complete list of supported cameras . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the preview images of digi@@ K@@ am can be read reliably . if the Exif support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not see thumb@@ nails , or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is how easy it can expand its functionality through modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I Mod@@ ules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( Manual ) is a joint module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed themselves . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or Ctr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop images works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the window , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or in another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be put into keywords , data list or search . &quot;
&quot; a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the file name only works if this blind view is displayed . which fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings . &quot;
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all the photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam , are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were created on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was created first . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly to an album . choose Album To scan images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . select Album Import screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an album from one album to another , you can drag the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu , you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features to give you information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select Edit album Properties menu . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - Coll@@ ections : are a method to select your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the collections for collections . &quot;
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums by Date sorting .
&quot; first attempts to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
when you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; open the first picture in the album as a symbol of the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; selected . this should help you to remember the photos on the album . sometimes the first photo album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol .
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , click the picture with the right button of the mouse and select it in the pop @-@ up menu . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in one collection and collections cannot be neglected .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ fs ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the section My Favorites list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images are displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview using the two lou@@ pes in the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; if you open an album for the first time , you have to wait a short while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . &quot;
&quot; information about each image will be displayed below the corresponding preview . what information is , you can change settings . select the albums page and adjust the thumb@@ nails to your preferences . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails have help window that appear . if you let the mouse po@@ inter a moment over a picture . the screen shot at the top of the section introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
photos are everything about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; go . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . you can choose from the context menu of preview or the menu image in the menu bar . you can choose between viewing images and slideshow or editing the images .
you can open the image processing with a photo by choosing either F@@ 4 image editing ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... select a tutorial on how to edit your photos . with image editing you can view your photos and change them .
&quot; you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the opening menu . to do so , and how to adjust them to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture etc . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides two options for rotation . the simpl@@ est is to click with the right mouse button to preview and rotate . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and F2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it will be moved into the tr@@ ash bin by &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 image del@@ eting or Del case you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My data list ; organizes your photos by means of data . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fs ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if not available , the date of last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the data sheet below in the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown . &quot;
&quot; photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers , the individual photos or entire groups can be assigned . as soon as a keyword is assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again . &quot;
&quot; if a keyword is selected , all photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to log@@ ically organize your keywords . you can also find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ s@@ quot ; fold , so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are saved in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . you can also use your keywords in other programs as soon as &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the images are noted . &quot;
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My keyword ; or on an existing keyword and then select new keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword after you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword will be the sub@@ stit@@ ch of this keyword .
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and del@@ eting . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a keyword by dra@@ gging it to the desired position in the tree and placing it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the attributes of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword ; change .
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to click the image with the right mouse button and set in the context menu as an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : as soon as you select the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can drag them to the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword . alternatively you can click on the thumb@@ nail of the images and select the keyword from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can have a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can select a keyword for each person in a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made , etc . &quot;
once you have provided a photo with keywords this will be shown under the thumb@@ nail of the image in the main window .
&quot; you can remove a keyword , in which you can click with the right mouse button to select the context menu of the photo and select Rem@@ ove from the Tags menu . the menu only displays the keywords that were assigned to the photo . &quot;
the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be shifted by this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame you only need to click the lower rec@@ t@@ angle of the selection frame that displays the time unit . this will display all associated images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
&quot; include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all pictures will be shown again . if the search has found nothing , then the lamp will be red . &quot;
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you will be able to save a simple search box as described above . but you can save this search here as a live search which always filter what you &apos;ve entered as a search criterion .
&quot; if you are happy with your selection , press OK and search will be performed . the text box Save Search as is used to select a name in My search list . if you want to change your selection once again , select the corresponding entry from the View list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to edit search , the form will appear again with the search information entered before . if you select to edit as advanced search , the dialog will appear for the advanced search to change your previous search . more information can be found in the Fol@@ der tool for Advanced Search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete search from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; advanced search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank . all rules can be added in line by operators or deleted from it . each option can be added with other information about the logical operations All ... , One ... , None ... or At least ... . furthermore , you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; . &quot;
&quot; it allows images to be compared by comparing these sig@@ natures . the smaller the difference between two sig@@ natures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar one . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ eting , the result selection can be enlarged or res@@ ized . if you move a picture from somewhere over the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sk@@ etch : hands @-@ free color sk@@ etch : draw a quick sk@@ etch and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; find the matching images . also here a threshold can be set .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble miniature program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel . move it while you press the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed , of course , pres@@ upp@@ oses that your images contain ge@@ o data . &quot;
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides a lumin@@ ous table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctr@@ l ; L D@@ em illumin@@ ating button from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light@@ table and its window opens . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; main window are you can quickly open the illumin@@ ating table with L Tools .
&quot; from the preview bar you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window and place there . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area can be seen . if you want to preview images from the toolbar and carry out Zoo or Move operations on one of the images , then you can compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series . if you use combination mode from the toolbar , then use the left mouse button on any preview image to display it on the left . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal dele@@ tion actions also work directly from the back@@ light like e.g. F@@ 4 File Edit ... &quot;
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to swivel the visible area of the image , you need to click them and hold it . in the mode preview , both images will display the same image area . &quot;
zoom the zoom slider under the images or Ctr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom in and out in the image . this happens in both images when you preview the zoom mode .
&quot; what is a digital inventory management - apart from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process following after the picture was taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos pic@@ ks up , sc@@ ans or digital photographs cap@@ tures a form of digital inventory management . however , most of us do this not in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images , find , protect and use photos . we will focus on the method for digital photographers to use the &amp; digi@@ pa@@ .@@ We will focus on the method for digital photographers to use the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed files . we will focus on the method for digital photographers , who want to save , archive , optimize , wait and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital stock management takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , ready @-@ made and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is based on your definition data that provides information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need to find a particular photo without inventory management . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you certainly don &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use certainly fast searches and secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you have something in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you have to decide whether to save others to your photos , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . be sure that you will have to switch to a larger drive at some point . &quot;
&quot; maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found on your location . if you make enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; export . export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements like version@@ ing photos , archiving , workflow , constant supply of pictures to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or an derived image .
&quot; we also recommend the metadata store in the Settings page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ box ; to activate it . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate dot on the album . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ones ? &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , as you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense , since you can focus on the best photos with the further work . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s use keywords , keywords as you frequently use in other programs or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import catalogues from a different source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; automatically set the tree for you or put the images in the correct place . re@@ arran@@ ging the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub @-@ tree to another . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different metadata is over@@ laid . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to let anyone know your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look closer to it , then you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I tell you that this is the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Beach quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . Wow ! you begin to dream , associations , memories , the historical period of time is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has completely changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to convey the meaning to the viewer to help Him about the motive that you have moved to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the strength to work only with a label for itself alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as lab@@ eling . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell chec@@ ker . &quot;
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it a boring planet in Google Earth ? well because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now starts with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities to use ge@@ ol@@ ocation are already inn@@ um@@ erable and will be even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geographic information . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word play with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use the copy@@ rights to remove constraints on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information should be stored in the set direction page ; as information should be stored :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not wished , the name of a company or organization can be used . &quot;
&quot; author title ( syn@@ onym for author @-@ line ) : associated with the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s job title . examples of this can be titles such as : employee Phot@@ ographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; editor ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider field to identify who supplies the photo . if the photographer works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group / agency will provide the picture here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections even though they do not offer protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or modify these images embedded in the image . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ pro@@ s this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; issues : plate error , panel failure , current violations , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ Track , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics , which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be treated cau@@ tious and you can no longer trust you than a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers on gold coated DVDs , &amp; pet@@ als ; 2 that claim a lifetime of 100 years for yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD disks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and put them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . so it &apos;s about choosing the right one . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very pr@@ one to mistakes , even if you have just been written . therefore , they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect yourself . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust , etc ; &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to perform miracles for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash drives , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said about CDs and DVDs , of course , is also true for the Blu @-@ ray disk . &quot;
&quot; slow down with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . then read the data again to check you . likewise , you should copy the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store on a clean , dark dry and protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
&quot; your manufacturers &apos; warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanics of hard disks on this subject : disk analysis . &quot;
&quot; shortly : dis@@ ks hold the longest when you are operated in a temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. At lower temperatures , the error rate can not be detected . some of S@@ MAR@@ T errors notice the im@@ min@@ ent failure . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you backup the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices don &apos;t matter much , it looks different for devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed process processors . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage , so protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against sp@@ ik@@ es is a sur@@ ge protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs some of the energy heat and gro@@ oves the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . however , remember that not every connector bar also contains a sur@@ ge protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it fulfil@@ s the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; because an over@@ voltage of any cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small , and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection system protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in a inter@@ ruption @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; besides the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically supply battery power when a power failure occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data and keep the system ordered . if you purchase an UPS then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as a sur@@ ge protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and and compare its safety in current distur@@ b@@ ance with the cost avo@@ idance of this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . at the end , you should always think about all cables before going on holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Sim@@ ple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive on &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; however , you are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; Dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; Dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data using the compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited memory , which should be verified in reality only . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the Web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and with the big companies included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ s provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . it &apos;s quite distur@@ bing that there is no protection in your computer . no one seems to have ever thought it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , because they create inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems at the moment , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk errors on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL @-@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ s fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS is used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not yet part of the kernel .
&quot; this does not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the work@@ station systems . with not@@ ebooks , the share of theft is already 50 % . &quot;
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most people think . it leads to lower damage than e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted .
&quot; open source file systems are less pr@@ one to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical borders . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
&quot; even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result , a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
&quot; you get a 750@@ GB hard disk today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not worry anybody else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . so , backup your data frequently to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous as re@@ installing your OS , sharing disks or res@@ izing disks . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your back@@ ups every day on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash suggests you &apos;re lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aviation fuel : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ iev@@ es are dangerous for your data . they usually concern an entire room or the complete house . &quot;
&quot; therefore disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as said above is a common reason for data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files should be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snap@@ shot at two times : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
&quot; incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup has been made . this backup comes with a version@@ ing system next with the exception that is only sam@@ pled , and not ongoing . &quot;
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium .
&quot; this procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you will come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; metadata , stored in the image file , retained IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , origin@@ als , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing , ... , usage of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; with this valuable images survive the next 40 years that is approximately the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; as the future is un@@ predictable on account of your nature , you have to look at all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate during the time . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the fewer variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to assess the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images then store it and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and you want to zoom in on a dedicated disk or partition . * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it on a new disk :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g to see if your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollars ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; # res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of a row if necessary &quot;
&quot; open Source Standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is available , you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; PNG has been developed as an open source standard , but it can be much more . it is loss @-@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . the draw@@ back is that there is relatively many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF needed and a slow compression . this format we would like to recommend you to store your images . &quot;
&quot; TIFF is widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( DE@@ FLA@@ TE ) . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a ro@@ yalty @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is developed on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now available for Canon and Nikon while using it .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in raw format , as it stores metadata separately from the image file . however , you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization supporting fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ CM@@ I belong to the activities of D@@ CM@@ I and the D@@ CM@@ I Working Groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a broad acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera edit , you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a more sophisticated editing , you can use external programs . if you are editing the images again &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; then you should add the metadata again . these were cut off by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the copy@@ ri@@ ghted images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them to web galleries , code them in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print , etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam . in the Ad@@ ding a photo to an album , you can add a description of how you can add photos you have already on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your album database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fs ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera on display mode and turn it . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is established , a he@@ uris@@ tic indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file association settings are displayed for each file , photos , movies , music , etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the features and metadata of the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; the Metad@@ ata tab shows the internal metadata such as Exif , manufacturer &apos;s note , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; or image processing . note that these metadata is not available with some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection from all . this loads all photos from your camera into a single album &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; . downloading the photos will not be deleted and we suggest you check if the pictures were downloaded safely in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired one with the default selection methods by &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the download and then download the selected photos . the Sel@@ ected download button is gra@@ yed out until you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , a new download option is available . these images have not been edited by &amp; digi@@ back . in this case , the new images are marked with an ast@@ er@@ isk in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you use the buttons All or download selected files , a dialog will appear with which you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums is sorted as normal folder . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you have chosen the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fs ; download the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All button . if you just want to delete some , you have to select them first and then delete Sel@@ ected Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . so you should check carefully if the photos were successfully downloaded into a &amp; digi@@ ; -@@ album , before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do so using the camera layout , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the file names are normally used again after the photos are deleted from the camera . this can result in double file names , if you load photos of different recording formats into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ columns . if you use this latter option , a folder will automatically be created per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that are carried out before the photos are stored on the disk . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date and time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want a different date format than standard format , you can , for example , use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % d % H : % M : % M . turn on the option Date &amp; Time . for more customiz@@ ations , you should read the str@@ f@@ time command . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera file name , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ ename , which &amp; digi@@ kam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . ren@@ aming your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used when you next time open the camera window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fs ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during the download . not all cameras provide this information . in the Page bar Metad@@ ata section you can read further details , about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is normally turned on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t supply this information , lets &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; the photo in its original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the lower part of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera provides information about the date the photo has been made available , it can be used to automatically download subtitles in the target album . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Side@@ bar Met@@ a data , you can check which information your camera could have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to disable this option . use the Advanced tab and select the dates @-@ based sub @-@ columns at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ kam ; you where the images are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog appears for the camera . select the folder you want to start , and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document , meaning that a position indicated in length and width ridges and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to mapping an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser which shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another and want to send users who want to document the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ el@@ ites and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a few who work together with GPS receivers . either as a map module or by transmitt@@ ing data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ one or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you need to save these data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the module for geographical mapping .
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data from images and from GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pres@@ crip@@ tions that are created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fs ; tries to give you as much control over his work@@ flows as possible . to access these settings , you must select in the Settings menu ; set up . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
select action can be displayed on a saved preview or image editing . you will set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; be sure if you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardis@@ ed and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields if the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . also with a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author title is a syn@@ onym for author @-@ line : this field should contain the professional designation of photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as employed photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a more detailed description of the car field , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author , if this is a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency should be en@@ um@@ er@@ ated here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this ensures that the metadata is permanently present in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed without being lost .
&quot; image cap@@ tions as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images save : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . attention : in images that already contain cap@@ tions , these will be over@@ written by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse po@@ inter is in the main window over a file . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . any file in a &amp; digi@@ kam ; Album folder that has none of these extensions , has been digi@@ ti@@ zed ; ignored . &quot;
you can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
&quot; the setting of the lamp by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fs ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , each time you open the lighting table these settings are not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole picture size lad@@ en@@ quot ; should you only use on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better viewing results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can switch off the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with a dark or bright color in the picture . these colors are fixed here . in the image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the compression of PNG compression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality as PNG requires a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the option TIFF files , you can turn the DE@@ FLA@@ TE compression algorithm for TIFF photos . this reduces the size of the TIFF photos . it has no effect on image quality since the DE@@ FLA@@ TE algorithm works loss@@ less . &quot;
&quot; with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the lossy compression option , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is quickly becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you use this option , solve this problem with minimal loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with minimal loss of details . this option hon@@ ours the picture a little soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 mesh pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if set this option , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is to use a fixed color balance , based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps will get more details in the top lights . for other cameras , this option is ignored . &quot;
&quot; the standard is the pointed light , so the parts of your images are burned in , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to look at the top lights , as penet@@ rating white . finally , you can try to recon@@ struct some parts of missing information from the top lights . &quot;
this is possible since blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to recon@@ struct the missing green and red portions from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course this is a question how much color or white you want .
&quot; if you choose to recon@@ struct the option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should be adjusted for each image individually . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the editing options of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should go conserv@@ atively . &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that have many cameras and which provides a matrix of color pixel . this algorithm is also known as a C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour structure .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for a colour sof@@ tening correction , since it is performed during raw conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how these should be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; information such as the color information of a color space in the others are to be translated so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Problems when a picture is opened in image processing / start color management module with raw files .
&quot; color Profile folder Sets the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c , where you will store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; check this folder during the start . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles You have here the option &amp; quot ; default source ; for your profiles to be stored . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . only your images do not display the entire screen .
&quot; not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not have any color @-@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma is not corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to do the color @-@ mapping yourself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate as your image would be given back from a device . this is very useful , before you print a picture as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could be manually corrected , rather than rely on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious what colour profile is intended for . unfortunately , not on the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style of the destination : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by delivering this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam , many modules that were written to collaborate with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see a list of the available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these will be loaded by &amp; digi@@ back ; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ commands for tasks that are performed by modules , can be set in the menu under Settings Sh@@ ort@@ cuts . &quot;
more information about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slideshow should be easy to understand . the upper controller adju@@ sts the time between the image passes , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes indicate the metadata that is displayed at the bottom of the images during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera features show a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right hand side there exists a button Automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . below are the port settings . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire storage devices are supported . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera selected from the camera list . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , where you can mount your camera . &quot;
&quot; to make your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it into display mode and turn on . &quot;
&quot; try out if &amp; digi@@ ti@@ lt ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any designation for your camera . it is displayed in the Menu camera of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot;
&quot; with the confirmation dialog for moving images in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer display , you can set the talk of &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections del@@ eting a photo and dele@@ tion of an album you will find more details . &quot;
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly using &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise you will need to save the changes with the button change .
&quot; you can also add &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze the display of the welcome screen ; this speeds up the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ kam , in certain circumstances . &quot;
setting Bei@@ m Start to new photos forcing &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something from the base folder was deleted asking &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; you know if it is to delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; be used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and to edit and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of preview and selecting the item Display / Edit .
some of them are not part of your distribution . you may find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the section image processing .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
&quot; editing functions of image editing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before saving a file or saving the button Save from the toolbar . note that you will not be able to recover the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
you may want to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with file saving as well .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by re@@ connecting from the File menu or the button Rest@@ ore the Image Processing in the toolbar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last store . &quot;
&quot; almost any action of image editing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can undo , by selecting Edit cap@@ tions or restoring by selecting Edit Rem@@ ove from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should contact the short@@ cut , Ctr@@ l ; -@@ Z and Ctr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; when you press the L@@ MB ; over the undo or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or recovered . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image up , picture , or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes in the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can zoom in the photo and zoom in by using Ctr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the check menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size you can use this button in the toolbar : automatically select magni@@ fying factor
&quot; full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you enter the normal view where you use the Es@@ c button . normally , you can also edit the toolbar . if you do not want to do this , you can check this in the editing dialog of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . see this section for setting up image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print individual images or entire sentences . entire image pre@@ views can be selected from your selection . you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select Print Ass@@ ist from the menu . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navigation file , even in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicking on the same tab leaves the side@@ bar to appear or disappear again .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are tr@@ unc@@ ated after 2000 characters and special characters are revers@@ ed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling panel in other applications you should consider these limitations .
&quot; after you commented on , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; next to the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read further metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this will always be done when you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images . &quot;
the evaluation shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and gra@@ ding . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut Ctr@@ l + 0 ... 5 .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field of ur@@ gency . the encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword view shows a search box to filter the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used in this &amp; digi@@ master file . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the search keyword . you can thus quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further relief in the input of keywords in a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed various keywords , they are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are keyword stored in the keyword &apos; keyword &apos; .
&quot; if you select multiple images in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only apply to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword filter section . &quot;
&quot; the page bar Key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar with their album , - date , keyword and search views is used . if additionally one or more keywords are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword is already existing , you can simply draw it from the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking if you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar tag . the keyword filter is selected on No keywords , which was selected using Ctr@@ l + a , and then a keyword from the right keyword tree was dra@@ gged onto the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be disabled under Settings Miscellaneous .
&quot; if you have created and created a rule , and note that it should be one or more , you can easily change this with double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry that is searched for in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keywords , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can set up an advanced search across all the elements of the database using the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group@@ ing button . the options will look as follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work .
&quot; the reason why one uses a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors used by your camera or scanner come from a predictable deviation from the actually photograph@@ ed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and the colors that you print or publish in the web to those from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . additionally , links with deeper information will provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , links with deeper information will allow you to make your own informed choices so that you can obtain the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image work@@ flows satis@@ fies all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below )
&quot; your only other picture editions are by email or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB functions so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another colour space and make thoughts about color bl@@ ur@@ n@@ g ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to uninstall my monitor when I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in s@@ RGB colour gam@@ ut or not , you will have to detect your monitor , as s@@ RGB causes the circle . if you work as s@@ RGB , you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore use it before attempting any further manual editing .
&quot; norm@@ alizing , comparing , automatic matching and contrast expand from the Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correction menu try to automatically make the best out of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ous values over the entire picture so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest point is as bright as possible without changing its shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed .
&quot; compar@@ isons : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ance factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it only produces waste . it is a very powerful operation that either causes wonders in a picture or it destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light boundary tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete history gram@@ ming area . &quot;
&quot; contrast : this method improves contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range , and a re@@ ji@@ us@@ cation of all values in between . this is only visible with washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos . &quot;
white balance by &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to make white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , then your possibilities for correction are better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side , both the original image and the preview of the target image can be viewed . the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original white balance again , then click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
pre@@ viewing the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button , you can decide whether any of the three colors or your sum is displayed . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in white balance . this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Load buttons do exactly this . any setting of the white balance that you have set can save you to a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences Panel sets all filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will result in another photo than your original . if you save this file your original image will be changed .
&quot; 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding also needs more disk space , comp@@ ute time and is only available for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color @-@ mapping can be done through the sub @-@ window for the brightness . a detailed instruction for using color profiles can be consul@@ ted from chapter color management .
&quot; this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time , so that you can always use them for multiple photos . this is useful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you will always need the same correction . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find in colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool colour effects provide you with four colour effects , a solar thermal effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ister filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also known as Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect of creating a partially developed pressure from the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas were dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial neg@@ atively of the picture . this tool allows you to fine tune this interesting effect . &quot;
the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase ultimately creates a negative image that so does not generate on phot@@ op@@ aper .
this is an example of the solar system effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this is edited ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simulated the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ire ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation resulting in a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy to em@@ bel@@ lish lots of photos .
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film produced by Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ote ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are also some photographers , especially those of the barely landscapes set up too much . &quot;
the Ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide re@@ ps the thickness of the ne@@ on light . for large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is not un@@ common to correct the color contrast and the lumin@@ ous intensity of the photos . you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
&quot; if you make a photo with poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to preview the satur@@ ation rather than raising it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is based on tone value correction for improvement of exposure . even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of the slider for the purpose of this tool . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into the image and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controller and observe how the picture changes .
&quot; on the right hand side , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is updated dynamically using the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this selection box , it can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic division is more useful . &quot;
&quot; three kno@@ bs : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the bottom for the medium sounds , often called Gam@@ ma@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ ew@@ rit@@ ters can be used in pre@@ viewing the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , medium and light tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . the compression of the output values can be used for example to create a light image as background while something else is to be seen in the background .
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
save as and load : these buttons can store the set values stored in the fil@@ esystem and then re@@ charged later . this will use the Gim@@ p level format .
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shadows , middle and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on pre@@ viewing the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicators option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is not an effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; below is an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modified channel : this sel@@ ector box allows you to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images captured with a digital camera , linear mode is mostly generated by a wide beam . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a curve panel to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond to dar@@ ker spending patterns , and that the corresponding pixel pixels are dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; to preview the original photos , a red marker is visible . if you move this marker on the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it on and off until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve you created can be saved in the file system and then loaded later . the file format for this is the g@@ im@@ p curve format .
&quot; if you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes you automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curves . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicators option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is not an effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance Channel . shadow and sun shades were set using the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image editing is a tool to enhance color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool for mixing the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu Col@@ ors @-@ Channel Mixer for image processing .
&quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left pane of the window shows you a preview of . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ viewing the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will display the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you are able to preserve L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness even if you are using the option mon@@ och@@ rome as the channel mixer then is THE tool to generate great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color results in a visible noise coming from the color space . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion thereby improving the color space first . &quot;
the saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer settings can save you later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicators option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is not an effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ ance preserve is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction capability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color pictures can easily be converted on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Panel F Plus , Il@@ ford XP@@ 2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits of the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot;
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic heavenly effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar light scenes at day@@ time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm light and medium sounds while it adds a bit of cold to the shade o@@ aks . this is very similar to the process of stopping a pressure and re@@ development in a sep@@ iat@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged d@@ ots or like a wall painting on a wall . &quot;
relief : shifting this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and the three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tured effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the stre@@ ching eye . under picture frame the module can be started from image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter set the desired frame type for your image . in depth , the image is surrounded by a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame . ideal for a button effect and decorative insert a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : specify the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool according to aspect ratio before . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into a picture in any place . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text orientation , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need them . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; &quot; OK &quot; . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool template you can put a template over a picture .
the menu Image St@@ en@@ cil application in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should be using maximum compression ( 9 ) for reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed template , just send an email in English to &amp; digi@@ ti@@ r ; Ma@@ iling list digi@@ ti@@ an@@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your St@@ en@@ cil Fol@@ der with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder where you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; once the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder appears . selecting a folder refres@@ hes the template &apos;s preview toolbar . &quot;
under the preview you will find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge This button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this button reduces the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template onto the whole picture , you need to shrink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template onto your image . the image will then be adapted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides three different tools for sharp@@ ening . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharp@@ ening is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very fast and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
&quot; bl@@ ur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per look . in fact , it doesn &apos;t work a bit , it works more psycho@@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ our and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang . &quot;
re@@ focus is perhaps the best of the three as it really enhances the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
&quot; photos without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ sed images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ tization process must be combined with only minimal differences to a color point . thus , the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally require more afterwards sharp@@ ening than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; with JPEG pictures , a camera is often used in internal sharp@@ ening . pictures in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
some scann@@ ers already use a sharp@@ ening filter while reading the image . if you de@@ activate it you get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharp@@ ening a photo with the sharp@@ ening factory default . you can call this using the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ t Shar@@ ing .
&quot; but they should be careful with this since the sharp@@ ness is not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also rein@@ forces the noise . in general , the most useful technique for shar@@ pen a picture is re@@ focuss@@ ing . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a bit sof@@ tly is considerably easier than shar@@ pen it . use the tool for sof@@ tening with the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ ting soft and experiment with some settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the bl@@ ur@@ ry is a very good tool to remove vei@@ ls from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tested first . an increase in radius or amount rein@@ force the effect . if you make the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed mask , noise and the impression of gr@@ en@@ ades can be generated close to sharp edges . &quot;
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore you should best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the bl@@ ur@@ red image which is added to the original . thus the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
&quot; the threshold is a break from the maximum of RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , zones with a soft change between the tones are applied to the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are exemp@@ ted from sharp@@ ening and thus avoid f@@ law in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image is the ( 2 ) . fu@@ zzy masks were applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool re@@ focused re@@ focused a picture by enhancing the sharp@@ ness . it used the protected design filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying the image to shar@@ pen . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese Fil@@ tr@@ ation . the traditional technique for sharp@@ ening pictures is the use of a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focus usually achieves better results than bl@@ ur@@ red masks . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing color re@@ focusing in image editing .
&quot; in practice , the circular circuit works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;n &quot; Circuit . the Gau@@ ß &apos;n &quot; Circuit has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result from the source pixel which is far from the original pixel pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s f@@ ission is greatly affected by the remote pixels . &quot;
&quot; circular Focus : this is the radius of the circular circuit . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should yield 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very bl@@ ur@@ red , but should pay attention to hal@@ o notes . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen by 0 @-@ 1 . use@@ able values are 0.5 and values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ening effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filters : an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce arti@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 . however , values are higher than 0.1 . however , the picture quality is very bad . a usable value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will still contam@@ inate the image . &quot;
&quot; G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the pal@@ ate &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your in@@ firm@@ ness Gau@@ ß &apos; is . in most cases , you should have this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts . if you use a value non@@ zero , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . increasing the size of the die can generate good results , especially if you select large values for the circle @-@ shaped sharp@@ ness or the gauge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all the cuts , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations do not immediately make changes that are not immediately visible , but they will leave unpleasant arti@@ facts later . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , bl@@ ur@@ ry Mas@@ ks produce better results than sharp@@ ening . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ red Mas@@ quer@@ ading a larger neighborhood than sharp@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; in theory , bl@@ ur@@ ry Mas@@ ks always have to create art@@ e@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of bl@@ ur . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter . the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better in processing small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied to a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
the original bl@@ ur@@ red color image must be corrected . this image has been made with an analogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods of field correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the smooth@@ ie knob implements the rough@@ ness of the area of the dark@@ ened area in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; the ink ink provides a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools for removing unwanted arti@@ facts with un@@ parall@@ eled speed .
the painting @-@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings fine , you can use the tab Gl@@ add@@ les and Advanced Settings . &quot;
&quot; attention to detail p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a uniform smooth@@ ness over the picture . a value of 0.9 should be kept in such a way that no sharp@@ ening is required afterwards . please note that the attention should always be subordin@@ ated to the directional dependen@@ cy . &quot;
direction addic@@ tive alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ulation or CCD t@@ rough will generate a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG arti@@ facts are best removed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all . p then defines the relative smoothing . therefore set this value suitable for the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it has to be set higher than 3 . &quot;
re@@ peti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm will go through . usually here 1 or 2 suff@@ ices .
&quot; angle stepping distance &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : Ang@@ ular @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles produce a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral increments &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never greater than 2 . &quot;
&quot; linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more of quality you receive by choosing this option is minimal . however , it dou@@ bles the run@@ time . &quot;
the Save As and Load buttons do exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and then loaded again .
&quot; correction of image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and draw a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button . &quot;
below you can see how picture errors can be corrected with Small Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te . the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera . as you can see there is a self @-@ made black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by a poor film storage during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease noise . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove spots and other art@@ e@@ facts that come from dust or ha@@ irs on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines .
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced Settings can stay with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and therefore minor bugs . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing the filter forward . if it is increased , noise peaks are reset . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details cannot be recovered and noise or lubrication stops again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not all the noise can be removed or noise points can occur . set it to a value close to the maxim@@ ums if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ fact without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : check the lumin@@ ance toler@@ ances of the image . we recommend using either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend using either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas which are typically smo@@ ky . it also poll@@ utes the shadow areas .
&quot; atten@@ uation : controls adjustment of phase j@@ itter atten@@ uation . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , smo@@ kers and phase j@@ itter appear on the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this . &quot;
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and then loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction was applied using the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a bit sof@@ tly is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool to shar@@ pen the menu item Cor@@ rec@@ t soft and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ e@@ facts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ e@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digi@@ ti@@ sed images . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for dy@@ eing and tex@@ turing . the texture mapping is performed with another tool , the image error correction , and the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; reduce JPEG arti@@ facts : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a lossy compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ e@@ fact quot ; - small standards that are seen in un@@ compressed picture . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
the Save As and Load buttons do exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and then loaded again .
&quot; photo @-@ Rest@@ oration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Ac@@ ting . &quot;
below you can reduce as a photo with uniform noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gran@@ ulation on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected version ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures have been applied to an old color photo that has been scann@@ ed with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that were caused by scann@@ ed lighting and photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Hot@@ plate tool allows hot@@ pixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark picture sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD errors . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . &quot;
the image area and the preview help you correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with current settings .
select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
&quot; average : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all the defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ plate correction on a color photograph , from a corrupt digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not light the entire sensor area equally . instead , &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting @-@ quot ; ( shad@@ ed ) they reduce the edges and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . teleph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which is impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise there are no shar@@ per effects caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and color or gre@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a rough image that without this filter is applied . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection applies the transformation with a cent@@ er@@ filter on an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three controls you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection filter , and with three more exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light gain d@@ amping at the point of the greatest density the filter . the standard density amounts to 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with an aperture of 1 , or by chance of a light intensity of 2 . increase the density to compens@@ ate for a larger degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values because you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma with zero and use the gra@@ dation from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a protected algorithm by David H@@ od@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . coloured distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree deals with the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s off the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of fourth gra@@ des correc@@ ts the removed corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can almost be eliminated . &quot;
&quot; in general , this value controls the strength of distortion second grades . with negative values t@@ onn@@ en@@ eous distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of distortion 4th grade . this value acts more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter &apos; has the in@@ verse sign of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value ren@@ ders the image size and results in correc@@ ting the first degree of gravity . negative values increase while positive the picture is decreasing .
&quot; light : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase them . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog shows the distortion pre@@ fix . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot;
the T@@ onn@@ el- or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all trimm@@ ing or res@@ izing . in case you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a spher@@ ical correction the effect would seem apparent to the wrong .
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal aid line . move it to an important location , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove it using the cutting tool in the menu Trans@@ forming trimm@@ ing from image processing or using the Zoom knob of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motives , such as shots from the front , frames and paintings it is the perspective to correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees have . note that when you hold the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the spher@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film from the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is available at this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ IR , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse , you can look at the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters set of film gran@@ ulation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option Add film gran@@ ulation if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator alters the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
&quot; because the filter mixes color channels for re@@ producing infrared film , especially the green channel it does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ et applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Fil@@ ters filter gran@@ ulation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ulation on your pictures . this is known by classical high @-@ speed films , such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films the manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the screening effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere released from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photographic , gra@@ iny view especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need even more grain , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film gran@@ ulation effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brush is better for large images . fl@@ atten the smooth@@ ie or , from the other side , the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbon sk@@ etch . therefore , the lines that outline the outline in drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch . this would be good pictures to start . &quot;
there are two kno@@ bs with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be improved further by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; filter engra@@ ver shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ ey@@ ed landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
shaft blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave Blocks 2 : analogue to the single wave blocks 1 the picture is distor@@ ted here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Ac@@ ting .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork using bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Down : bl@@ ur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center . this simul@@ ates the vag@@ u@@ ity of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur@@ ring : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by rotating the pixels around a focal point . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distance Description : wi@@ pes the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to res@@ ide in the background .
&quot; motion bl@@ ur : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by horizontal mot@@ ions of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing camera . &quot;
&quot; this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle light . &quot;
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ eme@@ yer : bl@@ ur@@ ts the image by random shifting of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed of an arbit@@ rar@@ ily moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur@@ ring : finds the color pool in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Ac@@ ting .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this gives it natural to your images a wet appearance . it uses an algorithm protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the picture it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eye changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
&quot; you can choose with the &amp; digi@@ box ; image processing a range of free from ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . &quot;
this is an example of the reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or turning it into the right orientation . &quot;
photo Bub@@ bles is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you blow up a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in an image when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm used here makes here a good work . try it and you will see it yourself .
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose the transition size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is to be seen below . &quot;
&quot; the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for blowing . &quot;
&quot; many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo Bub@@ bles was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you must tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
&quot; maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it has to be higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly to it . magni@@ fying each image for photo can be saved as a text file , and then loaded again . &quot;
&quot; picture Bub@@ bles is very fast with what it makes , but it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Ac@@ ting . &quot;
you can see below an example for photo blowing by enlar@@ ging a small color image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication .
&quot; editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together an image . to cut a photo you simply need to create the rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rec@@ t@@ angle . you will see this rec@@ t@@ angle as you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cli@@ pped by dra@@ gging on the corners of the rec@@ t@@ angle . a new rec@@ t@@ angle create by simply dra@@ gging it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mapping button in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( Ctr@@ l ; + X ) . use the Save or File Save files from the File menu to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview pane , you can change the size of the rec@@ t@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool according to aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as portrait format or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and in the landscape format of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool according to aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ res , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog you can set the range for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the selected ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool according to the aspect ratio cuts its settings depending on orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the trimm@@ ing tool next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation . the modified image measurements are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the trimmed picture and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the help guide allow you to hide help so that you can put your pictures together better . these help are :
&quot; harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ rule , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rec@@ t@@ angle into similarly harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles on the diag@@ on@@ als . &quot;
&quot; golden centre : the golden centre is a division divided into different natural growth patterns , such as spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it emerges in all the possible things that we perceive as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden pitch is the Ir@@ ration@@ ale Number 1.6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks built in order to construct your temples and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number deri@@ ves from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number is equal to the sum of their two preceding numbers . one composition which follows this rule is regarded as visually harmonious . &quot;
the golden centre provides more li@@ que@@ fied guides when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . in comparison to third @-@ party rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition guides the viewer &apos;s gaze down the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow in this way . &quot;
&quot; a further rule is the rectang@@ les of the golden spiral , also called golden rectang@@ les . these rectang@@ les are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles are also derived from the golden spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rectang@@ les . note that , unlike the harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not uniform tri@@ angles . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect of a dynamic symmet@@ ry called professional photographer . try to place your image focus on one of the focal points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise . &quot;
the Horiz@@ ontal Flip and Ver@@ tical reflect options can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the guides can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy that you keep the camera upright or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can fix this with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; image processing and the tool free rotation . &quot;
the values on this slider are specified in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slider back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse po@@ inter in the image preview to position the two lines . now adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
after you have rot@@ ated a picture you will find undes@@ ired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function Trans@@ forming trimm@@ ing from image processing .
an elegant way to trim the image is the automatic cutting function . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the rotation . note the above warning .
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective :
&quot; new Width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels . &quot;
angle at the top left : indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the upper right : indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the picture gets a little dirty . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adjusted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . &quot;
&quot; a horizontal she@@ ar for example will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left . in other words , a rec@@ t@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; sh@@ ears your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can switch horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed right from the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; you can now move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have performed the she@@ ar , the picture is wi@@ ped out a bit . for a single she@@ ar this effect is mostly negli@@ gible , but two notes generating twice as much pollution and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
after the she@@ ar the picture has some tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to remove it is to cut the picture with trans@@ formers cut @-@ out of the image processing .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fs ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been comp@@ ili@@ ated . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependen@@ cy on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system , but you will always find JPEG and TIFF below . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fs ; shows only files in formats that are familiar with . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , the file is digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you can change this list of file extensions that &amp; digi@@ box ; in the configuration section you will find more information about this . &quot;
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to choose the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there are better smo@@ other results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s release can also be saved without loss when specified in the settings .
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fs ; supports loading of raw pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ pack ; all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ; &quot;
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often saved in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fs ; understands these formats and will have no built @-@ in ways to view films or edit them . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies use to start the program for playback .

many tools you need the photo editing need in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; included . your description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ening , soft@@ ness , noise suppression , re@@ focus , bl@@ ur@@ red mask , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog , which displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applicable quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image . links from it allow five buttons to change the comparative mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertically divide without dup@@ licate . the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
&quot; horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area . &quot;
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper area shows the original and the lower one to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; &apos; mouse over &apos; -@@ Style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview pane , otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general setting page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the ability to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters in shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
&quot; this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble miniature program . you can zoom in or out with the mouse wheel . move it while you press the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed , of course , pres@@ upp@@ oses that your images contain ge@@ o data . &quot;

&amp; k@@ graphs ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; graph@@ ene . the &amp; graphs ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphs ; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; . it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; kate ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and displays them into &amp; k@@ graphs ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; make ; open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphs ; in a &amp; kate ; -@@ component
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems from about 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ Graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for displaying the graphs . required are in detail :
&quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graphs ; without starting an argument , the main window will only open the icon file and the ( empty ) list contains last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ; &quot;
zoom Zoom is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphs ; if you want to change your decision later , you can change the menu item Settings ch@@ graphi@@ cally ; set up ... use , see also . &quot;
&quot; when you open a graph file outside a running &amp; c@@ viewer instance , or eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ Graph@@ viewer ; instance or to display the graphs in a sub @-@ window of the current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but these can also be changed with the Setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; when you start the program , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both save and later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be parti@@ tioned on several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph will be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the parts of the graph . &quot;
page preview with a graph divided on several pages without head@@ line and with another font
&quot; the Rest@@ ore Download page gives the option to specify behavior when a file has been changed to disk , eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore changes ) , or let the program ask for each time . &quot;
opening gives the option to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ Graph@@ viewer ; specify if a graph is opened outside a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
you can set a default behavior ( open or open the files of the last session or not ) or specify to be asked at any start .
&quot; the context menu , which normally appears with one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opens up further possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithm . the entries , as described on the page of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directed graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered representations of directed graphs . the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then attempts to produce as short edges and as few edge over@@ laps as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for read@@ ed graph@@ ene . it produces representations in accordance with the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . in doing so , the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with a statisti@@ cally multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model layout for un@@ challenged graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ bre@@ man Rein@@ gold he@@ uris@@ tic and includes a multi @-@ purpose trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des circle @-@ shaped according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should indicate the graph@@ end@@ at@@ ei as parameters , and the comp@@ uted layout of the graph will output to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can specify special options , or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for each type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ readable graphs ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if this is necessary . otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
displays the What is the mouse po@@ inter . click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get further help to this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the base folder of the source repository .
&amp; k@@ Graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools for display . it needs the following packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphs ; in the Settings menu you will find more options .
&quot; the main window of the icon editor is divided into five sections : the main toolbar , the toolbar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ Col@@ ors palette and the grid , in which you draw the icon . &quot;
&quot; if the current file has been changed , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog appears where you can choose whether the icon should be created from a template or whether you want to restart from scratch . &quot;
&quot; re@@ stores the last one @-@ made step . if you do not make any step back , this function is disabled . &quot;
Inserts the contents of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
set the current symbol in gra@@ y@@ scale . this can create colors that do not match those of the icon palette of &amp; k@@ de ; match .
does not change the symbol but sets the current drawing color to the color of the point on which you click .
&quot; the status bar shows you the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fying factor and the current number of colors of the symbol . &quot;
Inserts the contents of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
&quot; open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols , background and symbol grid . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons add ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc ; modify . &quot;
&quot; choose Transpar@@ ent pixels or display Lin@@ e@@ ale and set in color : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as a transparent indication . you can also choose for the ch@@ ess@@ board size : the car@@ os on Small , Medium and Large as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : choose . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the SA@@ NE project or another source such as video streams . to do this you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE installed .
&quot; if you open the menu item Images , a dialog will appear that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default def@@ en@@ he default values to select your image accordingly . see the section of your needs before you scan the image . the estimated file size will be shown in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
make sure the window will be completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed .
&quot; after you have pressed the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the image file appears . here you can specify the compression and type of image file . here you can also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image . &quot;
screen@@ shots you can create after you have selected in the menu Import &gt; Screen Photo ... selected . a window appears where you can adjust the different screen images :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can view other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work place . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window under the mouse will be read . &quot;
&quot; the delay will determine how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other des@@ kt@@ ops , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to go there . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog box will appear with the options described above . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . with Fli@@ ck@@ r it is possible to show his photos to people who are important . you can display your favorite photos of the world and display the photos of your camera online and show your photos safe and private to your friends and family all over the world .
ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you are guided through the process of generating a token . so it is virtually your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in at Fli@@ ck@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after successful registration , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented to you after a successful login . &quot;
&quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you hit Yes , you get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section . &quot;
&quot; when the module export to Fli@@ ck@@ r is started for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current access permissions that the module displays . currently , the module does not support any other permissions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions . &quot;
the button Add Photos should be cli@@ cked once you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . click the O@@ k button to start up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server .
the keyword field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the image as a keyword during the upload .
&quot; with the Op@@ tionally , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options , you can set the permissions on your images . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the Change option to select the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered at maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export is a tool for ex@@ porting your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export has no documentation at the moment . if you are interested in writing this please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical location allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for loc@@ alization is available to loc@@ alize images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and l@@ atitude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ api.dll may download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures using a GPS lane .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the dialog shown above will then load a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were recorded at the same places in the same places as the images of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded , an automatic correlation takes place that indicates the coordinates in red . GPS Track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera crew must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera line here . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the maximum time deviation give an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera system . if the deviation below is the result , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have track data from one place for pictures , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add it to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area . &quot;
&quot; options Inter@@ pol@@ ation and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have the right data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ alization is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
the coordinates can be manually set using this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos on the same place . since dialog the coordinates of a call to the next you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
&quot; the loc@@ alization can also be found and set by the displayed map . select the region in question and enlarge it . choose the region in question and increase it again and again until you have reached a sufficient level . the map can be selected between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool for export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
&quot; this module has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . you can quickly select these albums . in the area below , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , you can quickly select a large number of albums . &quot;
&quot; the tab displays the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture a new page will be opened where the image will be displayed . otherwise , the picture will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show &quot;
the tab Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Su@@ it which contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG File Format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will be saved in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth , which of course affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the tab thumb@@ nails allows you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will be started automatically at the end to preview the gallery . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotation , zoom or sliding . the viewer can be used with short commands and ma@@ ges . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , an image will be displayed as standard in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less Module is a tool for changing images without compromising your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot;
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size is increasing as no compression of the color information is taking place .
the K@@ IP@@ I Digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer to a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this will then open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the data will be copied to the button OK . &quot;
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please look at ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG encoding module is a tool for converting a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
&quot; the MPEG code module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module also uses the pack@@ ets M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module , it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; you first need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG den@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can start creating the module using Tools MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . &quot;
the images selected by you are then listed under Image Files in the Portfolio . there you can also change the pictures or the contents of the list .
&quot; the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value generates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth picture changes . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave them black . you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the m@@ peg output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it is integrated into the movie . once you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start making a coffee with the button coding . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now take a coffee or enjoy the slideshow once you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the m@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick pack@@ ets via the settings button at the bottom . &quot;
the print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. : useful to improve you or print them directly with the Gim@@ p module .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RAW files into one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : expect d@@ cra@@ w not to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
&quot; first , select the raw file that should be converted and start the module . the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can now adjust the values in order to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether camera settings are to be used for white balance . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera is in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switches have no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are happy with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ ename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; Tagged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all the information in your image and uses the loss@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you are planning to edit your pictures frequently or otherwise continue to use it , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is wor@@ sen@@ ed . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Exec@@ ute button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use it . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the convert convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package .
&quot; proportional ( 1 dim . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : res@@ izing in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to the screen format . &quot;
non @-@ por@@ tional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; preparation : prepares the image for photographic print . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adapted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
&quot; after you have started the module , the pictures window will be displayed with the images selected by you . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will appear on the right @-@ hand side . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and place them in order to add them to the list of images to be sent .
use the Del@@ ete images to remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
&quot; after you have selected all the images , you can open the new message window to your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you only have to add the addresses and the subject here . &quot;
make sure not to send too many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations on the size of emails to be sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the pictures . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments on the pictures will be added to a text file and sent to the mail . &quot;
&quot; PNG format from the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and don &apos;t want to change the photo quality . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; when you select JPEG in file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be automatically closed so that you can view the status messages in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au , a window will appear with questions like you want to show your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL @-@ transi@@ tions option in the presentation enables very elegant image transi@@ tions using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slideshow will be very slow . &quot;
the File Name option show that the fil@@ ename of the images in the lower left corner will be displayed during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select the images displayed in a random order . so it is not the order of the pictures used in the album .
&quot; between the pictures , the temporal distance between the images can be set . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random@@ ly choose another effect between the images .
&quot; during slide show , you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on . &quot;
&quot; with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and restart , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; on the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module wallpaper is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the desktop .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub@@ menu option , as background for your K@@ DE desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you have submitted your pictures and videos with comments , you can browse with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , thus in persons , places and in group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you see the categories for which you have entered information when you have submitted your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current preview images . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse on the entry , the browser &apos;s view changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images shown are displayed on which both persons can be seen . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of displayed images from a few thousand images to a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can view them with thumb@@ nails to view the pictures of your sphere of activity . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same icon in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you defined yourself . &quot;
&quot; to display images next to the names , select the button that is located on the right @-@ hand side of the toolbar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view for each category you want to use . this has the advantage that you can see e.g. symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must select the image for each individual person . to do this , you need to open the image view window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the corresponding person . in the check window , you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and by selecting which part of the image is to be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you access the entry search in the main window , a dialog will appear that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string into the inscription or description field , the descriptions or descriptions of the pictures are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to be searched for ; the date can either be a part of the total date , i.e. for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the bottom of the window you can browse all the images according to certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , you can see pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like reading manuals , but rather want to try the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the Homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , screen@@ shots and introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , if you launch &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; start demo . then , some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the Homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . you can see a part of a database between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture will show you the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; and photo@@ album ; provides you with two ways to create HTML pages with your pictures . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the integrated version is described , which you can create through the menu File HTML ... &quot;
&quot; before creating HTML pages you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and destination . in the following , each section is described in more detail . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the title and a description that the HTML file should be included later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created on the overview page . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information should be displayed on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid that information is displayed that are obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , that all pictures are from a party . note that all pictures are from a party . therefore , you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why they are not specifically addressed . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . thus , those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no longer download images which , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time that you have specified . so it can browse your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transmission time . if it wants to get a picture larger , it switches to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this settings area , set the different folders and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; it is best to select a base folder for all your HTML files , and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the main folder where all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . this allows you to select a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example : &quot;
&quot; once you have created your pictures , you can check if these really are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will start . otherwise , the URL you set here should be that folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them there . to ensure the import function , see , properly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings described above have moved all three to base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you may want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures . if you already have spent a lot of time to record images , recording location , etc , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work does not even make . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can either export a .@@ k@@ in file directly from the File menu ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file along with an HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ in file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file looks for the images in a tw@@ o@@ fold way . first , it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files will only be possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can export through the File Export menu . &quot;
the most important option in this dialog is whether it should be an internal or external .@@ k@@ im file . there are the following three choices available :
&quot; to copy the option manually to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the option Automati@@ cally to copy to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you . &quot;
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the option Export File . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size since the .@@ k@@ im file would be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each picture should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File Import ... select , will import and import the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for im@@ porting is made up of four steps . first , you need to select what images you want to import , then in which folder you want to copy pictures . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is for your database persons . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories these are in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be downloaded with the categories of your current database . &quot;
&quot; it has to be easy to browse images and view : if you look at pictures , you often want to see images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will pass through the different steps of ( 1 ) setting the information about your images , about ( 2 ) through browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but frequently this also includes videos . &quot;
&quot; upload &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; saves all its information in the file index.@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of its images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; remember the folder where your images are saved and automatically re@@ use them on future starts . if you want to read another folder tree with images , you can start a different folder tree with pictures , you can start with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / index.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; via the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; setup ... go to a window that allows you to change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will be able to explain the different settings . &quot;
&quot; to the left you see six different symbols , with which you can preview the settings and options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which you can call by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also define your own groups such as objects , animals or albums for each picture . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog box used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ categories have already been mentioned in the section . in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ ator as explained . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules of multiple applications are used together , it may be that the modules are tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little has been tested . &quot;
&quot; the applications which use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage when sharing functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications do not support their images in albums . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order for some modules so you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ating &amp; Photo@@ Album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all images that show you the thumb@@ nails at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here are &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category presents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you use the category people , you will find the category , so if you would have chosen persons to view it and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; as some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select the modules you want to load . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you have &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used to any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu bar and a tool bar at the top . currently , it does not contain too many information as you do not yet have any information about your images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to provide any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information on the persons shown on the image , where the image was taken , etc . , for example , each image can either be pic@@ tured individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these comments can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists with a text box by setting people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; , as you will always use them whenever you enter information about your images . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the pictures in the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and are shown on all 50 pictures of the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can , by doing so that the used names are moved upwards , to find and assign people more quickly . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabetical list in alphabetical order , click the S@@ ort by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have ann@@ ot@@ ated ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and add these images to ann@@ ot@@ ation . in this case simply click on the above and back buttons , which are located under the thumb@@ nail of the image on the upper right . &quot;
&quot; if you have added several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to highlight all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a browser window showing the US as a transition group . in order to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special icon is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the comment dialog &apos;s context menu , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can simply drag and drop an entry to a category . caution , this assumes you just sort your categories in alphabetical order . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment catalogue by clicking and move the bar , which form the top edge of the frames . you can also make your own window from a frame by dra@@ gging it out of the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button ... that offers you the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide a frame completely . if you want to display this window again later , use the Options button ... and click here to open the window . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to display images in the browser , you will get an overview of preview images of the currently selected images , or if you have no filter . an example of this is shown here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , it will appear in the image viewer . if you have not opened a window with a picture viewer , a new window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the delete button or select Del@@ ete the Edit menu . now the window will appear that you can see in the picture .
&quot; and photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely images can also be used without you being stored on the hard drive . in the picture you see the image of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard drive . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album can show you the preview of these images . however , you can &apos;t view these images with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not support you to insert the CD in question . so if you want to avoid anger , how to avoid confusion of your images , please buy a larger disk to save all the images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the Pictures menu , you will find a sub@@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , please filter the pictures so that at the end those who can see your little sister can control and block the menu entry Any@@ thing except current view . &quot;
&quot; so you have fixed what images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item to lock pictures , causing all the images you have locked up . if you want to get the pictures shown again , click lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password which needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu Privacy . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , anyone who can access the file index.@@ x@@ ml may read or delete the password as un@@ enco@@ ded text . this type of password protection is only for those who are not very familiar with the view to private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason you are all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it , of course , that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason has &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; via a picture _ and video viewer . you can preview it from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can see you in . he shows , of course , the image , but additional all the information you have entered the picture , like who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag and drop it with the mouse . you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is displayed . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , see , display appropriate entries to this page . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser displays all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you would have chosen persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; loads a new image after a few seconds . how often a new image loads can be controlled by pressing Ctr@@ l ; S key by pressing Ctr@@ l ; S key . &quot;
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; can be changed into full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can move into the image and zoom out . to zoom in , you can zoom in with the mouse . zoom the Plus button zo@@ oms into the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rec@@ t@@ angle is selected and displays the result of zo@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; with the dot button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not shown zo@@ omed . with the Sync button sets the zoom , allowing each pixel on the screen to correspond to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zoom operations function in videos that are coming in and out with the plus and minus key .
&quot; with the screen@@ shots from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current image using the menu item Rem@@ ar@@ ks from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at pictures it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . at the moment you can view this and open configuration dialog of the image to enter these names . however , you may prefer to select only the image and view more pictures . &quot;
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you look one by one .
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to have pictures with features while watching them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic by pressing the corresponding letter . in the picture you see a picture in which the characters A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have placed features on your images , these are available in the browser . so you can see all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in preview screen . if you can display categories in the preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply press the letter for the feature after the image was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case you will allow you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
&quot; the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . &quot;
in order to view the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the painting mode from the context menu . to finish the painting just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you have read and understood . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire modes are displayed yellow .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of a previously selected object since all objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to add a new object to the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the menu item . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed so you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ eting either from the menu bar , or from the right mouse button context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and re @-@ click App@@ ly or disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; type user documentation in the Setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; click pre@@ viewing in the properties view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to ren@@ ame a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check locally . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the check@@ points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center of sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
each object has a visibility stage as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the visibility @-@ level of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility stage is smaller or equal to the visibility stage selected in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the object properties view are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the standard window layout , or if you need a different arrangement , you can set them as you like . you can also save several window orders and easily switch between different configurations . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window over or below a fixed view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ t@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange several views over each other , drag the starter in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card @-@ runner at the top of the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement are ho@@ ver@@ ing views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to resolve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the starter to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing upwards in the cham@@ fer bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any place . &quot;
you can save the current window view with View window order ... save it . a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . when this manual was written , was &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 out @-@ to @-@ date . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar or select the menu item View Sc@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview up to full images of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar , or select R@@ ender Mo@@ des from the View menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each render mode has a name . you can type any name , but a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map file size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination field quality you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user reflection light . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . &quot;
&quot; if an image is rendered with only one ray per pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , images with this property look better . &quot;
&quot; if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ utes and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling gives the adjacent pixels . the second method is adap@@ tive and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray of pixel . if you adjust the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels with super @-@ sampling , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub@@ pixels that are individually pursued and checked for further sub@@ divisions . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be adjusted to the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that generating noise for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch on it@@ tering , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental characteristic of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light reflection . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this map , you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is transparent , if the associated beams have no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for the display of the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason for this here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; import the scene , select the Import menu entry ... and select a file in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command @-@ scope of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if when im@@ porting error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you don &apos;t want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply highlight the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
copy and paste into &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; ren@@ ames a scene . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on help in the properties view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files which are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to add the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ t@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type indicator .
&quot; you can set the object capture of the points onto the grid in the contex@@ tual menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you tick high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for advanced proj@@ ections , all wire @-@ model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical proj@@ ections . this property yields a better approxim@@ ation for proj@@ ections but requires more time for rendering . &quot;
&quot; if you cross a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the floor , a ground beneath the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you tick the edge smooth@@ ness , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and threshold can be adjusted . more exact information on the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ des section . &quot;
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window regulations . in the Window setting section you will explain how to create and store window orders .
drop down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : displays all existing window man@@ ders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement allows you to create with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views of the selected window layout . you can create new views with the Add button and delete selected views using the Del@@ ete button .
&quot; with New column , you can create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , with map card you get a map view in common with the previous view and flo@@ ats the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you can follow all steps in this guide , you should be very popular among beginners : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings before you compla@@ in that you only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied as a result you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you do not include any light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black image . &quot;
if you have installed all error free you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window order :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols as well as their application . &quot;
&quot; to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select Edit menu entry . so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the designation of camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera is in the view control points with which you can change the point of view of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you press the App@@ ly button or the Enter key , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see here the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you might want to insert a straight ( inser@@ ting end bodies ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method of solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as a ground :
&quot; a good advice : choose the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly button or enter . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now also displays the level , al@@ beit at the moment only as a limited end . if you render the scene , the plane expands until the horizon . &quot;
&quot; in this case you will find only the default options for each new object . in this case you will find only the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . choose one of these options , change the possible settings in the object properties view . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the bottom to the exercise of a unit below the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and adjust the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select something in the moment . &quot;
&quot; the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom pigment ) , with one click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pigment shows only a matt black material because you can still enter the pig@@ ment settings . now , please always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t preview any color on the fa@@ der and ball in the preview , click App@@ ly first and then go to the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you want to render your picture with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , choose each time mon@@ och@@ rome and change the colors in the object properties view : &quot;
&quot; you should already be able to execute this step , as you should have understood the basic mode of working of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball is just as easy as creating the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the object properties view , you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the App@@ ly button ) , so the ball would float above the floor , since you have shifted the floor around a unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , rendering is now a strange result : as seen before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the next step insert a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already at the bottom , give the sphere a pigment as color : &quot;
&quot; select first object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on sphere pigment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
but you can achieve more interesting effects when you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press Enter .
&quot; the gl@@ am@@ our effect and reflection already result in partial good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers . hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple , but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a rendering method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the Ren@@ derer hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays sho@@ ots from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected by the objects in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog do . thus , the scene pixel is processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and a disk space . &quot;
reco@@ vers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since last storage have been dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last one @-@ by command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Un@@ do .
save the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the appearance , the short@@ cut and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can use this option to edit pre @-@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog for setting the toolbar . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option ; add and remove commands .
&quot; a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to pre@@ ten@@ se harsh surfaces without having to model any b@@ ump on the surface separately , without changing the geometric shape of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture mapping is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking on &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can specify whether any image should be displayed in a separate window or whether all images should always use the same window .
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the fil@@ ename in the browser window . then a small input field will appear in the lower right corner . if a matching fil@@ ename is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in dialog Configuration - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two other , short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser , the short@@ cut keys can be set for the respective windows . &quot;
&quot; if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
with this option you will save &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; at the end the name of the recently opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background will also be filled with the selected color . &quot;
you can set &amp; sk@@ ill@@ show ; so that only some of the file types are displayed that can display the program as well .
&quot; with this option , the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is switched on as default . &quot;
determine if the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cut for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ hl show here ; in the Map Poster Sh@@ ort@@ cuts for the display window and short instructions for the browser .
this option lets you switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays preview images for files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
the picture increases by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; Ku@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened anymore .
view the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
&quot; enter the first character of the fil@@ ename that you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ screen@@ ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . &amp; show@@ screen@@ ; is part of &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ screen@@ shot ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and make correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ foto , an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute his part to at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; and show@@ screen@@ shot ; makes it as easy as possible to report any errors or improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu provides a link to reports about problems and wishes . if you use this , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all the information you need is filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to complete your message . &quot;
&quot; show@@ screen@@ shot ; is a project supported by a community . i.e. , users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ screen@@ shot , then we would like to answer you questions to other users of &amp; show@@ screen@@ . however , you may want to answer questions about other users here . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instruction to join the developers mailing list of &amp; show@@ screen@@ shot ; . &quot;
&quot; show@@ screen@@ shot ; tries to give you as much control over his work@@ flows as possible . to access these settings , you must select show@@ photo ; set up . the Settings dialog is sub@@ divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should show the colors with what you should display , in contrast . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ screen@@ shots has a side bar on the right side that provides important information and actions for the selected images . you can also view them in the image processing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that do not make more than pictures to scan and save .
&amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that can no longer scan as pictures and save images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by typ@@ ing the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; with the command skan@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner you want to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; quit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options especially .
&quot; in order to scan an image , the user can start a preview scan only and then select scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to better select the image , the user can zoom in the image and zoom out from the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit in the window . &quot;
if the image is selected then the final image can be read using the Scan button .
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings selected , then the image will be displayed in a preview window as seen below . if Save is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demoli@@ tion and you return to the main window . &quot;
the Settings button opens the name of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
&quot; the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option must display a preview Before saving . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; images save . dialog to save for each image opens the dialog before each scann@@ ed image . if &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; this should automatically be selected with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking a file name . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are saved with the Save without having to ask for a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as default for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... . &quot;
this parameter defines a pre@@ fix for automatically storing images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image will receive a numerical suff@@ ix of each time a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can customize the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the Button Start starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button over starts the K@@ DE over -@@ Dialog for &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite ; . the Button Settings displays the dialog for settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; skan@@ l@@ ite .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; use like all other programs key short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cut can set you up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and set short commands ... Select .
&quot; you may set up existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ short commands work . thus , make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , playlist browsers and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function pause might look like this : &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . Amar@@ ok also has some command line options .
&quot; you should give a feedback to the user if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script whether all necessary modules are present and use dialog , so that the user knows why a script does not run . &quot;
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts , or just expand them to the required functionality . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can share data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; any K@@ DE installation should be included . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages allow for exec@@ uting external programs and commands . this is mostly used by ex@@ ec ( ) . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events even if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure The script to display the Setup dialog . in order to save and load the setup data , each script has to take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
tra@@ ck@@ Change signals that a new piece is be@@ amed . the script could now ask &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions more information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger between 0 and 100 .
&quot; in order to add an entry , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) . to remove one entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; terminate , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed for example to store data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the exhaus@@ tion amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should name your script packages correctly .
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permissions : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and add the link to the W@@ iki Scrip@@ ts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your item on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . perhaps you &apos;re looking for a very specific title from thousands of in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; you may have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right one to experience your music an@@ ew ! &quot;
&quot; usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; since &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable at the time of comp@@ iling with the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compilation options , certain dependen@@ cies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the System Requirements section . &quot;
&quot; enable debu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help developing &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort using the Setup dialog . the Setup dialog has several cards to set up different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; if the option is turned off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed ( Ju@@ K ) . &quot;
use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . this will change the color scheme used for the m@@ ood@@ bar .
&quot; drop mood files to the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be saved in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to a different browser which is not in the list above .
&quot; save Play@@ list when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when loading &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist when you exit . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use the absolute position of music files . &quot;
&quot; up @-@ to @-@ date items can be seen during a change of items , causes the Play@@ list window to be opened / rolled out to keep the running track always in the visible window area . &quot;
switching to the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is all@@ uded .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can customize and Amar@@ ok ; the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the fonts section you can select the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting O@@ wn fonts , the otherwise gray presented section is enabled . you can select fonts for the following area : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context browser . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ector for foreground and background color . &quot;
&quot; continuing playback at startup causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , playback will continue automatically with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last stop . &quot;
&quot; the On @-@ Screen display enables you to set up the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is ha@@ ked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text in the O@@ SD to be shad@@ ed .
&quot; using custom colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD colors for fonts and background . clicking on the color spaces opens the dialog for color selection . if O@@ wn colors are not enabled , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colors are used . &quot;
&quot; the Display Text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot;
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the Cart@@ ei@@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop down box . some drivers still activate further settings in this map .
the card collection is used to set up all the settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes to set up how to proceed with the selected folders . &quot;
Browse the sub@@ folder recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the scann@@ ed and their sub@@ folders will be searched for music .
monitoring : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all the found play@@ lists in your collections folder ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) add to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists then appear later in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down box driver : lets you choose between S@@ q@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected is another setup in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup required .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database section will be used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on calcul@@ ator : will the machine enter where the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then the network port is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use username : and password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
the card file last@@ .@@ f@@ m arran@@ ges support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can submit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register at the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send played pieces and so update the profile : this setting enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
retrieve similar interpre@@ ters : after activ@@ ating this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters can be accessed in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to be able to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
&quot; Amar@@ ok needs only the k@@ deli@@ bs package and no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some functions , such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org , for example , Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ lib developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the file that caused the crash .
&quot; in most cases , this is because Tag@@ lib crashes from this file when reading the met@@ a @-@ information . please report this error to the Tag@@ lib developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you are using MySQL in a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled libraries with the same comp@@ iler version have been compiled . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ lib compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable autom@@ . switch off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if it is a commonly occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info , but they are not known as Uni@@ code . the following per@@ l script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l die &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error when writing the Tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; unless $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbol in the status bar ( Rand@@ om / Rep@@ eti@@ tion / Dynamic Play@@ list ) is always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effect is visible in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined icon : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be viewed with ld@@ d &apos; whi@@ ch@@ r@@ amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this bug you may need to remove any colli@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
there are several possibilities . most of the installation problems are easiest to clear by using an expert for your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C on ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the # Amar@@ ok Channel .
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist will appear . how do music pieces come inside ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to make the interface intuitive , the Start sub @-@ window has been transformed into the stati@@ stic window . you will find it under Extras Statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the review column must be displayed in the playlist . click anywhere in the new rating column to set the rating for one item . you can also use the short@@ cut Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
select the files you want to remove and then press the Del on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then choose From Play@@ list Rem@@ ove from the drop @-@ down menu .
&quot; drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and drop them there , just as you would do it with other files as well . that &apos;s how simple it is : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the toolbar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , the Play@@ list button is located . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably you don &apos;t have the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config utility . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations . &quot;
&quot; the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via right mouse button ) . furthermore , you can find it on the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer .... &quot;
&quot; no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! none ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question must support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support almost every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; it may ! perhaps you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 decoder are included in default ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 w@@ de , input button &quot;
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device has to provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneous audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you search for the cause of problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify another ink ( e.g. hit sink ) . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice if you &apos;re looking for a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you &apos;re looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; also X@@ M@@ MS enco@@ des the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of the Arts . open Control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers running with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set : &quot;
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X has problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed rendering . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help you well .
&quot; either you do not use the Arts drivers , instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zers ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . run the command register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with command @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run the command @-@ register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . &quot;
please report this under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions / requests please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the Brit@@ ons Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run with the alarm command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you wake up from the soft tones of the music that you have stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to find out the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running title if you are on another computer ?
&quot; if there is a working SSH environment , you can proceed as follows : this command gives you an interpreter and title of running : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user its username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
visu@@ ali@@ zations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window frames . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size changeable window .
the combination of Ctr@@ l + Right mouse button creates a piece in the click sequence in the queu@@ e . by pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist the first search result will be played and the search returned .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
&quot; in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed . &quot;
my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; for normal reading switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , Per@@ cent@@ age F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically , this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual review on the overall result . &quot;
you can edit the rating for one piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column heading in the Play@@ list window . then you can change the rating of one piece just as all other attributes also by clicking the right mouse button on the piece and Edit : select evaluation or F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the Metad@@ ata dialog .
developers do not want to know when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that is not compatible with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
&quot; this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , but some users can also find anno@@ ying . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is a part of the toolbar . select Settings toolbar ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . install this then under Amar@@ ok ... Visual context @-@ browser design , click on Inst@@ alling New Design .... &quot;
&quot; the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
Kon@@ quer@@ ors Navigation Pan@@ e allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing in the account . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click on the Settings button and select Amar@@ ok in the drop @-@ up menu .
audio osc@@ anning is a free service to information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . audio osc@@ rol@@ bler is completely supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and cause a lot of error reports . &quot;
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to re @-@ configure and install .
&quot; now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; you have to install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same goes for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you have to re @-@ compile and install . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ ITI@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;@@ has no type .. How can I fix this ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , this is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must also be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 @-@ Stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as system administrator . then start Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with Amar@@ ok ?
setting up Amar@@ ok ... audio output give the device a . typically is h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 7x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ 7x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; enter the us@@ b audio in the x@@ ine installation dialog , and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the check on sound card supporting m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio edition with Arts won &apos;t be looked after . you must naturally take this problem yourself into the hand ! if you want , you can become the new so urgently needed assistant for the Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there are the setup assist@@ ants that are displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; then this quick start guide should help you . with their help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . drag and drop entries from the collection browser into the playlist . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save them by using the playlist &apos;s playlist , and you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window . &quot;
&quot; if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you will have the option to import play@@ lists , then you will find different ways to load the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the playback button . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the audio oc@@ d protocol : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just click with the right mouse button on an entry and follow the burning menu . you have several ways to burn a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally some additional packages are listed which make working with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable .
&quot; if you install these packages using a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like every normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others . the Play@@ list window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection . &quot;
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current piece or current stream . directly below is the area , the game time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the scroll bar . you can switch through the available analy@@ zers by clicking with the left mouse button on the pane . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fying window . &quot;
&quot; the PL and E@@ Q buttons are located in the pop @-@ up menu . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the Play@@ list window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set E@@ quali@@ zers . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of playback buttons , volume control and play position sli@@ ders . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the play position or volume . with playback buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece . &quot;
&quot; using the built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you tick the check box E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that don &apos;t exist in any other player , but don &apos;t let you deter from the abundance of features , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the Play@@ list window can be divided into two main areas , on the left hand side is the navigation pane . in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted using context browser themes . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ t . these three sub @-@ windows are later used in detail . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you may notice that the sub@@ window will start off . the information shown there are now distributed in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; furthermore , the information can be collected in the Statistics window ( Tools statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the music sub@@ window displays information about the current piece , as well as the interpre@@ ts and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first area in this sub @-@ window shows information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to see the play in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
you can find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . you see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time and its rating .
&quot; to view cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the images may have arbitrary names , but pictures with the word front in the name are preferred . the context browser will also include cover pictures , which are either embedded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , Recomm@@ ended pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played right away . &quot;
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this artist . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , Albums of the Artist , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all pieces in the individual fields to immediately start playing . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the play or album to the playlist from the pop @-@ up menu .
&quot; in the text sub@@ window , the downloaded song text is displayed for the running item . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using even written scripts . if not a text @-@ script is running , you can choose which should be started . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the changed version will then be saved in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Find button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running item ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing performer - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or gen@@ res are ignored . &quot;
&quot; when you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list with different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing artist / year - album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the interpreter is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpreter - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them by artist .
&quot; group@@ ing genre / interpreter / album - this setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the performer . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing according to suit . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the collection settings . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you own something on the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this could take a while . &quot;
a search filter is located directly under the toolbar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
&quot; under the search filter there is a selection box with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours to one year . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options . &quot;
load - This creates the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order into play .
attach to playlist - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect .
set items in queu@@ e - This function adds the selected pieces to the queu@@ e . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
&quot; transfer to Media Player - Ad@@ ds the pieces into the queu@@ e to transfer to the media player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; all pieces of this interpreter will burn / burn to CD - This option will be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed . &quot;
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; ( n ) Move files to the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; mark a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under various interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; picking up a compilation - ch@@ ats a record @-@ marked album back to a normal album . after that , the album is no longer displayed under different interpre@@ ters but again under the corresponding interpreter . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to deal with many play@@ lists , including smart play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; even created intelligent play@@ lists are possible . click on Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Smart Play@@ list , where you can enter all the criteria you need for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Media Player sub@@ window is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; using your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be used in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod , you will need to find the pieces on your iPod to Interpre@@ t sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list Interpre@@ t . if you are done , click App@@ ly . thus , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . if the transmission is completed , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and dis@@ solve the disk attachment for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden , which do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser , there is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a entered URL . if you are using tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can listen to music in the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachments of files can be difficult by simple dro@@ pping . in the event , the holding down of the Shift key can be helpful : thereby dro@@ pping files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired location . as soon as you enter the characters , only the pieces will be displayed , which contain the characters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text box is empty again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter separated search terms by whit@@ esp@@ ace , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter one two , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then wrap the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that doesn &apos;t contain a particular search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : - something is searching for pieces that do not contain something . &quot;
&quot; for example , Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath . &quot;
you can set the order sequence of entries by pressing the Ctr@@ l key and then click with the right mouse button in the desired order to the entries . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be played .
&quot; the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left you will find the Add button , which you can add to the playlist . to the right , you will find Play@@ list , Dis@@ playing Play@@ list , and Con@@ dem@@ ni@@ fying Play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons follow undo and restore . this allows you to undo or restore any changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the toolbar you find a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be adjusted by clicking the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu like that which you can view in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
&quot; there are many more buttons available for the toolbar , for example playback control and volume control . you can set the displayed buttons by clicking on menu and set up toolbar ... Select . &quot;
&quot; the status bar displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . the status for random mode and retri@@ eval will be easily changed by clicking the mouse button twice in the respective display area . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the option status bar in the general settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on menu in the playlist . &quot;
one click on this entry opens the Windows Visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in your collection browser .
the Cover management contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left hand side .
with the View menu you can choose what is to be displayed in the cover administration . select :
&quot; the queu@@ e administration has received your great move into &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have even more control over the playlist . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece to the queu@@ e , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces to the playlist , or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queu@@ e administration . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ set ( the details to set up these follow later ) . &quot;
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random pieces while playing .
adds pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio osc@@ anning ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
&quot; double click the playlist you want , drag them into the Play@@ list window or click with the right mouse button on them and then choose Load . thus , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Play@@ list Recomm@@ ended pieces start with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece of your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at least one piece of your collection , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep track of the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : dynamic mode settings . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point . using the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can be de@@ activated again . &quot;
the New button re@@ popul@@ ates the current playlist and adds new pieces according to the dynamic mode . edit playlist and edit the playlist and you can change the settings .
&quot; by right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then , the dialog for editing the playlist settings will open . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not be dup@@ lic@@ ated in this playlist . if the setting is active , the played pieces will be removed with regard to the setting of played pieces . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of played pieces to be kept at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 , then the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the Settings on the right has been described in the previous section . on the left hand side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; random pieces will be added from each of the play@@ lists you have crossed . &quot;
some scripts enable your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click on@@ set .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by installing it on the script . once you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script for longer , you can delete it . then click Un@@ install to delete the script . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information about writing your own script , please refer to the section Writ@@ ing of Scrip@@ ts . &quot;
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins is used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ alis@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plugin simply activate the check box next to the name .
&quot; this Quick Start will show you how to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to create an audio CD in four steps . to track the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder of audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog window where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other lossy compression formats , remember that you will receive a worse quality when coding to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a loss@@ less format . &quot;
in this dialog you can do nothing . please wait until the machine has finished the burning process .
&quot; this Quick Start will show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot;
&quot; to copy a data CD , select Extras , Copy CD ... from the menu . you will now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning . &quot;
&quot; after you have all the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you will now see a dialog box that looks like this : &quot;
&quot; in this dialog you can track the progress of the copying process . as soon as the reading of the original is completed in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to burn the data . &quot;
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burn the image file . you must wait now until the total progress has reached 100 % .

to fix this problem start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / lib / k@@ de@@ 3 / plugins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS with your base folder by &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
&quot; the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org , where you will get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and you can get feedback from the forums and receive news from the forums . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 . &quot;
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program is burning audio or data CD R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a text @-@ like description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burn all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically cho@@ oses &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; to burn CDs . in some cases it reaches &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however higher quality in burned @-@ up audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open and patented technology for audio encoding and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis prof@@ ited from Open Source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and encoder modules .
&quot; mad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG audio decoder . currently it supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module . &quot;
name : a far developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
fla@@ c : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ MPEG , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : additional libraries for processing various audio formats . using FF@@ MPEG it is possible for example to de@@ code w@@ ma files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co &quot;

trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , it can be useful for creating mixed CDs and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different record levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ happy effect that the music pieces are played differently loud . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method of re@@ charging recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . clicking on an entry opens the project .
&quot; save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed where you can select folder and file name for the project file .
stores all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file Save .
&quot; closes the current project . if a project has been altered and hasn &apos;t been saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then disc@@ ard between stores and changes . furthermore , you can cancel the closing also and keep the project open so . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what is to happen , just as if you were called for each project file . &quot;
closes all opened projects and ex@@ its &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for any un@@ saved project is asked what should happen with it as if you had called file closing .
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project through the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you are entering the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the so added files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is that ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you can &apos;t use files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is intended for you rather than help to allow you to see the files and folders already available on the medium .
this feature only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this feature removes no files from the medium . it only prints the previously imported files .
opens the CD copying dialog . it also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively you can only create one image from a CD which you can then burn at some point later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning when you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs .
&quot; the copying / reduction of a DVD with the help of copying dialog is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
&quot; open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing mod@@ i over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; burning a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data that is then immediately burned by pressing the burning button . ( ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for an * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings and even ways to change the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the content view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of toolbar elements of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . when an entry is checked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is checked , a small bar at the bottom of the window will be displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is activated , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info , Lock and unlock the disk or ej@@ ecting the medium . &quot;
&quot; the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the header is a narrow@@ er area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header bar does not have real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window to change the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the ke@@ yp@@ ad assignment . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wizard . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be performed . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on th@@ ief . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine tuning of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled for example via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; in order to use the D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line or the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , therefore your taste and the type of your task are the key to which of the binary programs you give preference . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all have &amp; k@@ de ; program de@@ file , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface by &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; features functions like copy@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for creating new projects . &quot;

&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can get a project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to modify the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which applies only to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String _ name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) void qui@@ zz@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String ) void &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then adds files to the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / some@@ fil@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; file reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it , very simple audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer . &quot;
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in WAV files on hard drive ) and from many enco@@ ders that enco@@ ded these WAV files by default ( These Ko@@ di@@ ver packages still need to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and saved to WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or even in other formats such as the loss@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step you need to install l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders . however , all these programs are generally not necessary to compile anything yourself . however , only the co@@ dec packages are installed that are needed . &quot;
&quot; which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not the firmware of the CD ; / DVD device does not cover the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanisms of copy protection . avoid simply buying a copy protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while set up only once needs to be done ( the Setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , later the daily use for reading a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , about which you will frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; convert to many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is recorded manually . &quot;
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example there is more information how this program is used as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
&quot; the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data starts in accordance with the setup of request in the CD@@ DB register . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - when a encoder is configured in the Code tab in the setup directory - the encoding .
&quot; opens a sub@@ menu with a list of the encoder available , so that the selection with another encoder can be read as the default . it is important to note that before the encoder has been configured in the Code tab in the Setup dialog . &quot;
opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected to code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
&quot; opens the Setup dialog to configure the kind of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ acks ) for program events ( such as reading &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as encoder , to set up the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes audio quality , encoding and compression rati@@ os and helps you choose the right encoding . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . apart from FLA@@ C there are also others such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rati@@ os and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but the differences are less important because both Ko@@ di@@ ers generate very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will nevertheless be supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license issues &quot;
+ High to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from one computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices is present .
&quot; MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - initially 2009 - support these devices only the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex tracks of a track . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a track . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or retri@@ eved by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand over / used with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with encoding programs , there are often a combination of program settings for the code reader and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords : when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt is enco@@ ded by l@@ ame and the title Par@@ ameters of &amp; k@@ ri@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ Inv@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button of a button in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs , which can download information , rather than entering the computer . it is important to note that only text is spoken here : &amp; CD ; Title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) is not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the CD ; information publicly available on the CD ; more or less valuable , so neither the artist nor the music business can be inf@@ lic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ nick@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address is not used in retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This may only know the program@@ mer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ nick@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is needed . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know more , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD . please note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the right distribution needs to be installed first , if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; for the first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting the code . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
&quot; the Ko@@ di@@ ver package must be installed by the Linux distribution concerned , before the code can be used . this is also necessary for pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers can be found in the Chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; after installing a code , further information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) . this must be replaced by the name of the installed encoding . &quot;
&quot; check the device name of &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read real to it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) installed . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want a copy protected audio CD ; check out the sleeve of the &amp; CD ; this will not be possible !
&quot; there is a chapter with one step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything but are somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set it up and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 stit@@ ches ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; you need to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found using a search engine as it is not considered completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which of course you can always do . &quot;
please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd contains and that you have write permissions on it ( eg by trying to copy something inside ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , something which is probably only done once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD , which needs to be repeated for each &amp; CD . &quot;
here we determine the code to use for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . since we are la@@ zy we share the program with which to use fre@@ ed@@ b to download the CD ; data from the internet .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change them when reading a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is handed over to the reading @-@ program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , then a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries existing there for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the map file General settings . here you don &apos;t have much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is as left / typ@@ ed as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; only in case of incomplete information , select so that you will be informed if information on creating keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot;
the card file CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data can be downloaded automatically via the internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b machine .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD ; it must be connected to the Internet so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection box is simpler , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately starts the reading of the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory names / fil@@ ename or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or file name is changed with Con@@ Tra@@ ce &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two sel@@ ections must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how do the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the computers . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equally as it concerns the server , since many fire@@ walls bo@@ unce the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with protocol 80 as the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice . &quot;
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , therefore simply try yourself . &quot;
CD ; throw out after reading the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; cast off at the end of the process .
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the WAV files are saved . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; all the way it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be fli@@ pped to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned before , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage . &quot;
K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously to enco@@ ded WAV files : at a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
&quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change them again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , is described in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is structured as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b needs to be retri@@ eved . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each output &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD ; which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots see a bit different from the data obtained for one &amp; CD ; with success of fre@@ ed@@ b removed data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually enter data instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD needs to be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only when the CD ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , then look for the FAQ section of the Help section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successful from the fre@@ ed@@ b could be retri@@ eved , all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ Key for your &amp; CD ; there is a window appears , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for automatic retri@@ eval of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist no longer has to be entered in the &quot; &quot; Current Title &quot; &quot; input field unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the bottom comment field can be used for each comment ini di@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments which are common to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words start with upper@@ case letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ irable comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment section . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set on the encoding settings section , and take a look at the &apos; Basic Settings &apos; section . &quot;
&quot; K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all coding or file formats . see the help for the code to get more information .
&quot; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example can be found under Rock . &quot;
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the CD editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . just enter the items for the items in the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the play list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are selected . a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece or press the button All pieces at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
&quot; if the selection process has been selected by clicking on the selection process , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the articles and track what &apos;s going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar . &quot;
this is the window to control orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will show you if you are trying to work with a code which you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we &apos;ve entered here in the sample . do you check if you have write access to the temporary files and destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : mission 4 is the encoding of bit 1 into the format .@@ MP3 . thus , read and code in parallel . note the status message at the bottom of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and encoding . in the case of weak machines , the result is uncle@@ ar . the computer with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem at simultaneous interpre@@ ting and encoding ( from however two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last song is read out , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order in the queu@@ e is enco@@ ded . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window appears with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; you will need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. and 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the code of your choice . &quot;
&quot; most distri@@ butions contain , however , already a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ ri@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is included . if you read this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is aimed at people compiled from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different memory cards of the settings , and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hi , still am reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked on after the initial start of the program without any locking point as it should go on from this somewhat empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ ri@@ creator ; thought . whoever wants to add something useful or modify it may do . at least after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore in agreement with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke player from &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others he has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time high@@ lighting also some features that others &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows can drag to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the method used .
&quot; seat support . if you are &amp; k@@ de ; while stopping a song , k@@ mid starts again with the same song next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Windows into &amp; k@@ mid ; this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button playing in the toolbar , select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts when you move it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( in case of several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played one after another . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and running it with the knob . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly , you can click on the arrows left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ inter and thus change the playing speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when one piece is played , a pressure on the space bar appears like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry Pause in the menu item , thus breaks the play . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and others both . some pieces have no text at all : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events to display and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which a song is used , so that you don &apos;t have to manually adjust the Kara@@ oke Text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an event type , select the text events and / or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summar@@ ize . in this section , you will see how to use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu Collection under the heading Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired items in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection contains all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when applying the application , this collection is not stored . remember that when you add lots of pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on setting automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; when Automati@@ cally Add to the Collection , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; when Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu of the menus collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to continue a song , select the next song button , select next song from the menu item or press the arrow on the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse a song back , select the Pre@@ vi@@ ous@@ Next song , select Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but it does not matter , since it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general MIDI . in this case the MIDI @-@ map transl@@ ates general @-@ MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right piano events into events of the change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type , and thus always sound a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need any MIDI map because all sound cards GM are compatible ( including A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you need to edit the appropriate file manually ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file which saves all necessary replac@@ ements for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section that may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
define PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D define key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D define key@@ map &quot; An@@ other key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D define CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
see that define is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not general MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section you will see how the patches of General MIDI can be m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general usage looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the sign string is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you cannot change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; if your keyboard for example does not support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun . to do this , enter the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here is meant with the term &quot; &quot; drum patch &quot; &quot; of the patch where each tone represents another perc@@ ussi@@ onist instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to specify how notes are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you must create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used primarily to map tones to the perc@@ ussions channel . take a look at the key@@ maps provided .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to ex@@ changing the first and the second channel , make this easy in CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map with the name name will be used for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x will be used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates , in which ratio pitch @-@ B@@ ender occur@@ ren@@ ces are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value n , it is converted using the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file there are no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM features a keyboard that receives a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a tone higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards attempt to play two notes down to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the correct value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; around . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI @-@ map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you will find this in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which tones are being played straight .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a drop down list , where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button does not flash red , but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds .
&quot; the tempo LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; so if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . this allows the same MIDI file to perform on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; well , I cannot force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; to use . but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that &apos;s because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos; s start page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all the files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree , that &apos;s why supports &amp; k@@ mid ; Drag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; previously , enable automatic Ad@@ dition setting to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can use the arrow key to the left of Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the standard speed , you can double click on the LCD . &quot;
I have a &amp; k@@ de ; I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI @-@ Fol@@ der and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) just go to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; change the file and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn off the automatic add @-@ on to the collection , and the new file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ M@@ mid , B.@@ mi@@ de and C.@@ mid@@ . First , you just want to play the first file . so , set the automatic addition to the collection and open A.@@ Ther@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then you decide to play B.@@ mi@@ de and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to continue programming . &quot;

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external synthes@@ izer as the sound quality depends essentially on your sound@@ card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an EE@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course not hear music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the mailing lists or send an error notification directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ MPEG . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as to playback DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; c@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ ock@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only appear when information is reproduced in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections under the Book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Continu@@ ous Play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy level . if you have an entry , his group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do that by editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only click on a name of a category , click on it from the View menu and then edit it . by clicking a sub @-@ group , only the XML content of this part will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , select the playlist from the playlist and select either the edit mode , or select another category . &quot;
&quot; all changes will be lost when the edit mode is left or another group is selected , without removing the playlist . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the ease of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
the animation during startup and loading can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and change &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would be anno@@ ying at the end @-@ animation however , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; body ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ g ; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the Configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; console &apos; button in the toolbar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer visible .
there is no tab for this playlist in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; all must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . here is an example of how a flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; S@@ MB ; it can even embed the special field on YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; so that the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player must be specified as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave @-@ flash in the Setup dialog file assignments from K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; thus always a given back@@ end for a specific M@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; can play cards from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be st@@ owed , the device can be configured and the TV channels need to be configured . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in the settings is under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . &quot;
&quot; because the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( presum@@ ably this type of playing of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server needs to be functional . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) : &quot;
&quot; for the time of the creation of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , open source , open@@ source , open@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if enabled , start playing the playlist . &quot;
are there any hints how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be used as user root after connecting the device . it is absolutely certain to ensure that / dev / c@@ drom indicates the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
x@@ ine starts slowly but why must my CPU be checked for its performance every time ?
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ ts@@ . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically takes the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

&quot; most of these components can be included in the GNU / Linux distribution . for the installation , documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be included . &quot;
the &amp; C@@ ile ; Project contains some already compiled packages from &amp; K@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; K@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the K@@ ile ; website . &quot;
&quot; if you have questions about or when comp@@ iling them , or if extensions are desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list K@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for &amp; k@@ de ; work surface . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers the option to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; latex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; latex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about the posters ; and to learn his possibilities , the manual should be consul@@ ted on K@@ ate . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can start working there directly with the reading of the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate . &quot;

&quot; here just a good view to &amp; latex ; given , it is not the ultimate book for it . to master &amp; latex ; good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contained at least the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class , which begins with the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class , which begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the Quick @-@ entry Assistant by &amp; K@@ ile ; is a useful feature for fast creation of a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; . the selection of the wizard ( menu ) provides some options for creating the document .
&quot; document categories : with this , the type of document to be created is selected : article ( article ) , book &#91; Newsletter &#93; , Report &#91; Newsletter &#93; , Articles ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; Print &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom . &quot;
encoding : this is set to set the character encoding . modern systems are increasingly using U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as default . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; latex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; latex ; . for integration they only have to be selected in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( to comply with the German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry about . it &apos;s just a brief description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; offers - just like other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; K@@ ile ; if you see bigger areas of a green text on the screen , it is due to the modest appearance of the output file nevertheless noticed . however , it will save you by high@@ lighting time and faster . &quot;
&quot; with the automatic completion of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically creates a blank line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu settings K@@ ile ; setting up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled . &quot;
&quot; all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following items ( part is the most , and appro@@ ve the lowest element ) : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; latex ; files can be very helpful when creating a DVI ; file ( dependent on D e V ice I n@@ dependent file ) &#93; , by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; - Viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; -@@ source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ atted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the PDF output ear@@ t by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing of DVI ; files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the return search , the elements of the DVI ; file are linked to the editor and as soon as one element was cli@@ cked in the DVI ; source code is the exact opposite of it . once you cli@@ cked on a section in &amp; latex ; the source code is cli@@ cked to the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set about project project settings . &quot;
quick @-@ build : the &amp; latex ; source code will be compiled and the result will be automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file will be up @-@ to @-@ use , and there is no call to &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the Edit toolbar , the three large selection fields should be found . the selection fields have been developed for quick integration of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for quick integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections ... The available &amp; latex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection box Fur@@ ther is for the insertion of articles such as keywords , foot@@ notes or references . the available options are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name is created for a section , an image or any other element . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a specified term ( selection via a selection box possible ) .
using quote will appear a selection list with literary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this works only if the file is necessary for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors necessary . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can naturally also be written in &amp; K@@ ile ; by hand .
&quot; the last selection box with the name size is used to specify the font size . it can be used to set the fonts for the main text , the gro@@ unding notes , etc . there are the following fonts to be used : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; K@@ ile , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and determining the settings . 2 . the document can be written by reason on the hand . &quot;
&quot; the brackets after the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; determines the font size . if the font size is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s building or the button &quot; &quot; Schnell@@ bau &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; hur@@ ry ; the storage will run automatically .
&quot; if the document is comp@@ iling , it should be searched for errors in the log file . if you use quick construction , should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be observed . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( close environment ) is a text that is different from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created , and only a few columns shall have a different font size . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } may then add the size of the font within the environment . &quot;
the changes are covered only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and usability of the document . for example , certain fonts , fat print , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for cur@@ sive pressure and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a proposition can be displayed it@@ ali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . quote begins with \ \ begin { quot@@ a } and ends with \ \ end { quot@@ a } .
&quot; after the background for writing the source code with &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language was presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; . &quot;
&quot; as soon as in the wizard a bit of text was entered , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be accomplished . therefore , a quote , a few passages in bold and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem should be applied to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed it can be returned to the editor using Editor @-@ View or Ctr@@ l E ( with the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window has to be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted to a Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is an independent file format ( e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screen . &quot;
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - can then print the document by means of a print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
&quot; the toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; latex ; source code , the conversion can start into different formats using the buttons in the toolbar . &quot;
the pre @-@ selection allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; K@@ ile ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; -@@ Bin@@ ding files . to do this only Modern will setup under Settings K@@ ile ... Tool Build .
&quot; to check the pre@@ fix , the mouse po@@ inter must be positioned in a row of the source text and then click on pre@@ face search . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; viewer then takes place then . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; latex ; -@@ document of &amp; K@@ ile ; open and jump to the corresponding line . this must be set in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as a text editor ( setting up ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor )
&quot; should an error occur when using the Quick @-@ Set of the &amp; DVI ; viewer , there may be an error . if an error is present , this is displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
the logging file indicates the source of error in the source code . in the editor you can then select the La@@ Te@@ X errors and laun@@ cher La@@ Te@@ X errors for jumps between the errors . the log file must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log file and &amp; K@@ ile ; jumps to the faul@@ ty line .
&quot; when cli@@ cked on the respective button in the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template you want to use for the document . the pre @-@ set options are : &quot;
&quot; when choosing a blank document , a document can either be re@@ written from the ground or the wizard for a quick creation of a new document can be used . &quot;
&quot; frequently user of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be in &amp; K@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; K@@ ile ; can create a new template by using an existing document and selecting a file template from document ... create . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in Settings K@@ ile ... Settings can be set . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering in document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
the simpl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way the following steps must be completed :
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template will then be selected instead of the default size . &quot;
template Object could not be unser@@ i@@ alized successfully .
&amp; K@@ ile ; used &amp; Po@@ sters ; as internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings can be made directly from &amp; K@@ ile ; made out .
&quot; to learn more about posters ; and to learn his capabilities , the manual should be consul@@ ted on K@@ ate . users of &amp; K@@ ile can start working there directly with the reading of the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate . &quot;
&amp; K@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference that can be called over the menu Help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a sufficient description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; usage and their syntax .
double @-@ clicking with pressed Ctr@@ l key to select the tex ; this means that by clicking on \ \ par your \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par is selected .
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the most different types of source texts and to emphasize these . for example , the &amp; latex ; -@@ commands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assist@@ ants can add additional jumps within the text . this is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu entries are highlighted in the text . the menu entries are highlighted , and this jump mark is highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; K@@ ile ; . although &amp; kate , have been added in &amp; K@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; special commands for their selection . under Edit select the following commands to select text selection : &quot;
&quot; this extended meaning includes a text with persistent lines ( like in other text editors ) . this expanded meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only le@@ aning thing in &amp; hur@@ ry ; is that the settlements are separated by two blank lines . &quot;
the word is under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also contains &amp; latex ; commands with a back line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
&quot; to solve a part of the document , naturally this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key . &amp; K@@ ile ; provides the key root C@@ TR@@ L ; K with the whole line is removed . under Edit removal , the following commands are included in the text of the text : &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; K@@ ile ; is included in the description on Edi@@ ting select paragraph .
it has already been interpreted that environments a central role in &amp; latex ; play . therefore offers &amp; K@@ ile ; for other commands in the edit environment for a more simple work with &amp; latex ; .
&quot; with this command , jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment . &quot;
&quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment . &quot;
&quot; when the cursor is before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the over@@ sight of the surrounding environment can be quickly lost . this command t@@ aps the most recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure is not distor@@ ted . &quot;
&amp; K@@ ile ; also offers special commands for &amp; latex ; groups which are determined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from the edit environment .
&quot; with this command , jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the welded clamp . &quot;
&quot; with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the welded brackets . &quot;
if the cursor is in front or behind the cur@@ ly bracket of a &amp; tex ; group # is spra@@ yed to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted shar@@ pen@@ ed group cl@@ as@@ ps you can quickly recover the pre@@ viewed group . this command will lock the last ge@@ aring group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the tex ; groups will not be destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; latex ; two simple quotes are used as guest houses . for the beneficial implementation is used in &amp; K@@ ile ; the sign is used for two simple quotes . also for the ending of the application , the sign is used . &quot;
this automatic insertion of double quotes can set up under Settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
&quot; you can also use specific settings ( e.g. , german or french ) and thus German or French suits . there are also many more languages available . &quot;
&quot; when pressing Shift , Enter &amp; K@@ ile ; an intelligent line break . if the current position within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is located , not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a sp@@ read@@ sheet environment , you close and hur@@ ry ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an end @-@ to @-@ end line break . &quot;
even better - &amp; K@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; latex ; - or custom environments . these can be added under Settings K@@ ile ; setup ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
&quot; some users want to assign the columns in tables - environments and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; K@@ ile ; tries to achieve this . while this tab@@ ul@@ ator is not the associated entry , for &amp; K@@ ile ; some intermediate space for the column position of the current tabl@@ ature . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; kate , this has already been added to a good source code execution , this has been added in &amp; C@@ ile ; three different modes are installed , three of which are built on demand and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different ways of working under Settings K@@ ile ... Compl@@ et@@ ely set up . &quot;
&quot; when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and will probably increase the complete list . on the other hand , the list can be reduced by typ@@ ing another letter . &quot;
&quot; all orders are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are naturally removed when selecting a command . alternatively , a jump to these positions can be made possible by means of the Edit brand entry token and the desired parameters can then be set . &quot;
&quot; under Options K@@ ile ; setup ... K@@ ile ; complete settings can be made to these lists . it can be selected different machine lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ cher of the general language use . &quot;
the command mode is not necessary for completing environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin entered and the call of completing mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand the environments are used so often that &amp; K@@ ile ; a special mode for completing environments .
&quot; when calling the completion mode over the menu or the Alt + Shift key , the command to create the environment is automatically frozen and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the environment can be continued in the simpl@@ est way and by pressing the input button . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment will be closed again automatically . once &amp; hur@@ ry ; realis@@ es that it is a list environment , it is even a first \ \ item command . &quot;
&quot; under Options K@@ ile ; setup ... K@@ ile ; complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the default list of completion mode for &amp; tex ; - and latex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ ile ; supports custom lists of abbrevi@@ ations which can be replaced immediately by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... C@@ ile can be set up . as an example of an abbrevi@@ ation list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L entered and the word processor mode is introduced over the menu item ( Ctr@@ l + Alt Spac@@ ebar ) , the character L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ cher are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been noted that many closures in a document are written more than once . thus , &amp; K@@ ile ; the completion for all already written text . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the menu Settings K@@ ile ... C@@ ile can be completed . here , also the threshold value for displaying the completion can be set . &quot;
&quot; the complete files can be installed in the sub @-@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ ile / complete / mode / the Persian Home folder . mode is for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
the dialog for graphics make the graphics as simple as possible . to view the fundam@@ entals of the graphics formats the sections should be taken and taken into account .
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and additions of pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted into a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf . &quot;
&quot; to see the result of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed group@@ wise in the menus creating comp@@ iling , creating change and creating view . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewers like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the keyboard root Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI ; file can be converted into a PS file by Alt ; 4 , and by Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed . &quot;
&quot; when using the &quot; &quot; Schnell@@ bau &quot; &quot; command a viewer is normally called after the comp@@ iling . if not a built @-@ in viewer is used , each time a new window will open . &quot;
a new project is being asked about the project project New Project .... There will be the following information for the project :
&quot; when selecting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; K@@ ile ; allows the export of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed over scripts in vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet finished and can be used in other versions of &amp; K@@ ile .
first we need to say that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; K@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = K@@ ile ) with the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a quite sophisticated system where the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; K@@ ile ; provides a lot of different help to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; delivered with many documents . this includes documentation for the included packages and another &amp; latex ; reference .
&quot; this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather a complete instruction manual for &amp; latex ; it is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k which contains a database containing all the information about &amp; K@@ ile ; provided documents and for a graphical surface area .
&quot; all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or preferences . by &amp; K@@ ile , only the results are displayed . &quot;
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the empty space opens the viewer for the document .

&quot; using the command @-@ line interface , you create random sig@@ natures or sig@@ natures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides sig@@ natures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; . &quot;
&quot; for random sig@@ natures , an arbitrary signature is read from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . by many sig@@ natures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails diversi@@ fied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for day sig@@ natures , the same signature is read for all day from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out for each day use different sig@@ natures , as with the random sig@@ natures you create unique e @-@ mails . &quot;

you cannot choose any or more settings from the Settings dialog . each setting is supported by a help window through the action .
no or more parameters can be added to the Lib@@ X@@ S@@ LT parameter section of the dialog . this allows the transfer of parameter values to the style template .
&quot; to apply the changes made , press the button O@@ k . the pressing of Cancel re@@ jects any changes . &quot;
&quot; the dialog can be closed by pressing X in the upper right corner of the window . if the settings are to be changed , then open the dialog again . &quot;
&quot; once the style template has started , the menu Deb@@ ug@@ gen Insp@@ iz@@ ers can be selected ... then click on the card @-@ runner clips , as shown in the example below . &quot;
a fil@@ ename can be an absolute path to a local file . or only the file name ( eg ; x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ s@@ l ) .
template or Mod@@ us@@ name can be a fully qualified name with which the non @-@ local part is optional such as x@@ s@@ l : my@@ template will also be lab@@ elled by my@@ template
&quot; first click the holding point in the list of the current holding points , then press the Rem@@ ove button . &quot;
&quot; the status of a particular tag is displayed in the corresponding text with another background color . the desired color can be selected : see the Edit Settings dialog , on the Col@@ ors page . &quot;
&quot; you can set , de@@ activate or delete a holding point using buttons , the de@@ bug menu or the icons in the toolbar . &quot;
most of the output from &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is tra@@ pped and is shown either in the Insp@@ ire ... dialog or in &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; output window . the following exceptions apply from this rule :
&quot; the various tools are available through the debu@@ gging menu , with the Insp@@ ire tool most important . &quot;
clicking on a step @-@ by @-@ step lead in the menu will display a dialog for selecting the running speed .
&quot; to stop the process , press the W button or select step @-@ by @-@ step guide in the menu . &quot;
&quot; to find a system ID in the current &amp; XML ; catalog , select System ID ... in the menu and enter the value to be searched for in the displayed dialog . &quot;
&quot; to suggest an Public@@ ID , select Public@@ ID ... from the menu and enter the value to be searched in the then displayed dialog . &quot;
&quot; if the inspection dialog does not appear , select Deb@@ ug@@ ger Insp@@ ire ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click on the folder path source code in the appearing dialog . &quot;
all &amp; X@@ S@@ LT ; source files included by the &amp; X@@ S@@ LT file or their si@@ bl@@ ings are listed here .
clicking a source entry in the shown list puts the text cursor in the main window at the beginning of the corresponding file .
&quot; if the inspection dialog does not appear , select Deb@@ ug@@ ger Insp@@ ire ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click on the folder path source code in the appearing dialog . &quot;
all the found templates are listed here . it is important to note that the export rules of &amp; X@@ S@@ LT apply . therefore several templates can be present with the same conventions and mode details .
clicking a template order in the shown list moves the text po@@ inter in the main window to the corresponding line of this file .
&quot; local and global variables are shown on a map in the X@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g @-@ In@@ spec@@ tor dialog . the following example shows X@@ S@@ LT source code , where a global and a local variable is declared . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on a variable from the list , you get a summary information in the dialog box below . if a variable indicates a specific expression , for example &quot;
&quot; contains , then a new XP@@ ath can be selected by entering a new value for the variable expression and clicking the button expression . &quot;
&quot; when clicking a variable entry in the list , the text cursor in the main window will be moved to the corresponding line of this file . &quot;
&quot; version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their involvement in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; . all these tools use Kom@@ mander as a surface and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as under@@ lay . the combination results fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de documentation knows me pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s raise it a bit and give it a graphical interface ! no longer dependent on a terminal ; simply click on the icon for the XML @-@ Proc@@ essor and done !
&quot; this application expects a index.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if not , then remove the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time a my@@ pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface . &quot;
&quot; if the currently opened file index.@@ doc@@ book is , then simply release the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where index.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is faul@@ ty . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file is already checked already in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then let the current file be cli@@ cked . if not , delete the file at the current file and select the file to be examined using a different file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to know if the file well @-@ formed is , click the well @-@ formed check selection . &quot;
&quot; for use of a &amp; DT@@ D ; , which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( external ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition UR@@ I ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG validation is speci@@ fying the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; application tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then simply select the current file . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result should have named , and the file is usually stored in your home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , have to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plug @-@ in system will instantly benefit and do not need to wait until someone is using the fake in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . more about this you will find further down . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a plugin , we start editing with the Edit menu . this opens the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows you to manage all the plugins included and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plugins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
&quot; often working on one project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog . &quot;
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves for unique identification .
&quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub@@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of their own identity are important in terms of news and comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another benefit by cap@@ turing the members of the team : it can be an event for information about the team leaders when something specific happens . see in for more detailed information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something happens in the project . an example would be the drawing of opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone is working on it , or a script that plays a file into CVS , as soon as they are added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the side event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the receiver list . add@@ res@@ sat can be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments through the following things :
input is simple . it can either be selected from the comment entry from the editor context menu or typ@@ ing the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the team member , should be given the appropriate range or sub@@ project names as shown in the following examples below . &quot;
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ eses and the characters : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up by settings Qu@@ anta ... This dialog covers some pages that are treated succ@@ essi@@ vely .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including auto @-@ completion can be changed with this . the entries are :
&quot; big / lower case of tags : big / lower case of automatically inserted tags . normal big / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; capit@@ alization of attributes : large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes . normal wholesale / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optionally close by tags : if ha@@ ked , for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , this is immediately after the &amp; gt ; added . &quot;
&quot; not optionally include tags : as above , for all other tags , with the exception of simple tags . &quot;
&quot; update start and end date automatically : when turned on , the resul@@ tant tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the appropriate encoding during ti@@ pping .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . restore the default sets using the default button .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise referred to as File Open opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting here will be pushed out from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting here will be ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates backup copies regularly , so in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file . &quot;
&quot; preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or in one &apos;s own view ( or the documentation in a guide ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
reset window settings to default at the next start is useful when the UI is confused by changing the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / dro@@ pping views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameter .
the warning message area serves the control of the possibility to disable the display of war@@ nings by att@@ aching no more ques@@ tioning .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the PL@@ - and source code view in shared mode .
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the representation of Par@@ ser knots in the document , can be adjusted in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the area of structural tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the refresh frequency of the tree when editing and how deep when changing the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid . this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ reci@@ ation abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plug @-@ ins can be managed here . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third party , which can be re@@ used by any sound @-@ capable application , most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a booth location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is transferred to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
load the component in the &quot; Nur @-@ Read &quot; mode : check if the plugin ref@@ uses to load the load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ bytes usually refuse to load when this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct . un@@ select allows saving the entry even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment but it should be installed later .
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; starting from version 3.3 , troubleshooting is completely new . ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been shut down , as well as support for the D@@ BG debu@@ gger . instead , a debu@@ gger @-@ plugin concept was implemented , which allows different implem@@ entations via plugins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , the support for the usage of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; insert . &quot;
using the debu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable debu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin selection box the specific settings can be changed .
&quot; if a debu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; UI : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is indicated . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all stops are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower D@@ ock .
a view in which output ( as in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower D@@ ock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the debu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action will result in the connection to the debu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debu@@ gger , so that normally it is not necessary to care for it . &quot;
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to the debu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to request a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the debu@@ gger output .
&quot; as@@ signs the debu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and running information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . happens before a de@@ bug is started , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution runs further . happens before a request is given , the execution starts as soon as a request is made . &quot;
the debu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without entering into the functions or includes .
&quot; the debu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , whereby if possible , it is possible to clean@@ se into functions and includes . &quot;
as@@ signs the debu@@ gger to ski@@ p the instruction and go to the next as if there were the current one .
&quot; opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable . &quot;
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g which can be found at http : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many further works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you can customize and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; adapt to your needs and like you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help you to become better .
&quot; document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to provide support for mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; their simplicity and flexibility makes out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two ways , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; and tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool rails are handy , symbolic editing of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , which insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see in for details of conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also toolbar . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes of tags as well as the layout and content of the property tab ; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day shows . the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . toolbar buttons enable fast insertion of tags in a document without risk of a writing fault .
tag folders are nothing as a folder . they contain only the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the description language and version so present . ( for example html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declare whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible , so that other users can have a better view and more information when working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and boundaries is presented in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but does not contain anything else as an element type . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( family 2 )
valid only for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family only 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family only 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has an common attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to each other day . ( family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . additionally it contains other tags describing how this attribute should be shown &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code used to fill in the tag editor dialog and the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag may occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
displays a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a single element type .
returns a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ti@@ dy cha@@ ined and closed .
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements like &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced . this will not cause a leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is in the top of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Windows to launch and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . to choose . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions will follow . &quot;
this function is currently not available yet . currently the check will only occur when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
in the following one example for a family 1 tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; scheme . the fil@@ ename for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a working family 2 day XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; revision function is described . the fil@@ ename of this tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; character _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; option &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c file is just as simple and there is an editor for it to be accessed via DT@@ D . this can be edi@@ t@@ descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a new created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D indication . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . click New action leads to the same dialog :
&quot; with clicking the user defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer the current short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
the simpl@@ est actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when performing the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use them as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the Quick Start dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
first the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : sh / home / my@@ home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . On this way tries &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in the command line :
% f : we have been replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
% p@@ id : is replaced with PID of running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is added to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can input data from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the selection box input can be determined what to send to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected part of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually meaningful only with this setting .
&quot; there are two types of output : normal output , written to the default output ; error messages , directed to the default output . it can be specified what is to be done with the text written to the default output , by setting the value the selection box output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the tag . &quot;
&quot; once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window to start editing mode .
fill in all the required fields and add the tag to the right toolbar .
&quot; complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning their use , enable &quot; Edit Tag &quot; dialog when available , so that an input is possible when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? do we replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Fur@@ ther programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size other . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the fact that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually called los , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol will be inserted ; starting ; -@@ Tag in the current document will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it still has to be connected with the action . this is done through the menu with settings speci@@ fying actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so it still exists , or confirm with OK . &quot;
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to toolbar or you should set them to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the toolbar dialog by setting toolbar settings . make sure that the desired toolbar is selected .
&quot; I want to select the separ@@ ator ( top left ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar . &quot;
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar must be tested by using all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; after New@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please customize their &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that their toolbar will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type . &quot;
perhaps the most desirable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation to the scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you might be checking in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory , if someone has done it for you . &quot;
there are two parts in this process . first you need to have an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file .
&quot; func@@ name # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = Your description for these docum@@ entations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 documentation section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ ht@@ m@@ s.@@ html = tag@@ .@@ html tag 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html &quot;
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation :
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents , # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tac@@ x.@@ html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that there are sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the shaft ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
&quot; note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ enti@@ ally , at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) . &quot;
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but make sure &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; Resources to be replaced . &quot;
&quot; for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script should display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by marking the function name and pressing Ctr@@ l ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of separate context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can simply save your file doc@@ r@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( like you specified it in your file doc@@ r@@ c ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the fail@@ ing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , toolbar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . in different places there is an email sending menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , send tool bar toolbar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions are checked and only made available if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication . in order to make a donation , the source of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private g@@ pg key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the dialog New resource you need to pass the input fields ( URL preview can be empty ) and with clicking OK the upload will be started . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , toolbar toolbar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Tem@@ plates and Scrip@@ ts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installing , investig@@ ates &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signature . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource . &quot;
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in any day XML format . there is the simpler way to automatically convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D loading and converting an DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . then the following dialog appears :
destination directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; doc@@ type definition line : the string , which should appear in the ! Doc@@ type tag , like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand this and to get full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you must first acqua@@ int yourself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring these concepts to them without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses , available . from tool rails over promotions , everything that is marked as globally , is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to backup different tool rails , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development agents for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool rails with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ beds the joint use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree tables with information and the tool rails . please insert in , and for more detailed information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the mouse button with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document pass@@ able , re@@ charge , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ marks or version of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editing pane will lead to another context menu related to the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , edit the tag under the mouse po@@ inter or opening the file if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor . &quot;
&quot; at present &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert one single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click on the icon that has several attributes ( as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog various fields . &quot;
&quot; the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) make it possible to navigate in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open it and ro@@ am . in the presentation with map lin@@ ers are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided . this view displays all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be done with the displayed context menu . &quot;
&quot; almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website , etc ; all possibilities are open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be classified into three categories depending on which context they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates are only usable for the respective user and templates in projects . more on templates can be found in . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of incorpor@@ ation into Global , Local and Project is also working here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , man@@ ly can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the entry system aligned to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can add , edit and view project specific documentation . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window , can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this guide shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , toolbar buttons are extensively extended and easy to understand . display them on a symbol and display the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the toolbar is the option to define custom commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the toolbar as a compressed tar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they get a tool bar in an email you can save them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other save and load !
&quot; it &apos;s reasonable if you want to adjust the location of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems starting at &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of their bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while striving to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a na@@ ï@@ ve idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , would be an independent , expand@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already far on the path to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the suitable &amp; IDE ; be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of why develop what already someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; framework is not only this all possible but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is possible almost every task . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and quickly turned into a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in the detailed documentation is help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Se@@ quit@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a snap@@ shot list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file , which is not on it , and the oldest entry is removed . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there are special characters for &amp; HTML ; -@@ Sch@@ elling , so that they display correctly and not be mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting instruction . &quot;
&quot; converts the text from clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; sp@@ elling , which is the correct way to insert special characters and whit@@ esp@@ ace in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor tag . &quot;
switches the block selection to or from . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the Shift key .
go straight to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script gives error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of script functions and the debu@@ gger .
development and switching of the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the toolbar at the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries predic@@ ate or next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other open documents appear group@@ ed in the menu according to the fil@@ ename of the other documents .
opens an existing project from hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
displays a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
search for new files that could be there . this allows you to copy graphic files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
attitudes such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details explained .
loads a project toolbar . these are stored in Project Dir / Tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or Project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this creates only the name . actions need to be added by means of settings ... and you will be asked by tool@@ bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; removes a tool bar from the field of view . it does not delete it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar , you will be asked if you want to do it . &quot;
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ team so that the toolbar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as app@@ endi@@ x .
enables up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server where everyone else can access it . see in .
loading a &amp; DT@@ D ; which you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
download / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; . it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder doesn &apos;t exist fails the load .
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar . if the default ( HTML , ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current tag creation dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . smart inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting using the toolbar is denied if this day is contrary to the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plugins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on them . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activate it . &quot;
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available map schem@@ ata depends on the rendering ; -@@ version .
&quot; select the type of line marking . very useful , if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
veri@@ fies the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by means of the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; by some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries , switching may sometimes need time or cause unpleasant graphic . recommended is the map card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . &quot;
enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affects any application that uses the K@@ HTML element , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
direc@@ ts the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate ; find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or add them and change the sequences .
&quot; this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse po@@ inter , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and licensed , but as with any Open Source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should best be filled up from top to bottom , for example after completing the project name the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information panels can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , the file will be filled in automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here is the server address of the machine you want to access , one unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemplary ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol are used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default , if a shared collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the toolbar tracks are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default Tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows you to paste files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s be checked if files , which are somewhere in the main folder of the project . if a project is started from scratch , not anchor . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection according to your preferences . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by attachment or by removing the tick , clips out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project properties in the menu in the sub@@ window profiles or changed using the Shift key Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( wild@@ cards is possible ) which will be ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; additional option to the above , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can be read more about project views . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to select the desired debu@@ gger . currently , only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set using the Options button . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ files Profile you can upload high @-@ load profiles ( see in ) , as well as display a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by ha@@ iling an own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the Team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration dialog you can turn event actions and add , modify or delete event actions . event actions will be executed when a previously specific event occurs , such as the backing of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the last project opened . this behavior cannot be affected at this time . &quot;
to open another project select project ... from the project menu or the icon project open from the toolbar . the dialog project will appear and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , closed , the project file will be automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders behave as well , but the opening and opening entries are missing ... in the context menu called with the right mouse button : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
&quot; allows removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is blind@@ ed to prevent removal . &quot;
the password will be kept in the kernel memory and forget about the program . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is needed and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk will not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many upload profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed : &quot;
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed k@@ io slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; normally , this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there may be many views in one project , i.e. by simply swa@@ p the view , various files and toolbar can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbar . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored , opened or deleted from the project or project toolbar , accessible via settings toolbar project toolbar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do most . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; as already mentioned above , toolbar functions in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are st@@ ress@@ able via the menu Tool@@ bar . use and addition differ . adding tool@@ bars is treated below in the Add tool bar section . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar and the symbols on it can be configured either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , and perform other actions such as toolbar , ren@@ ame tool bar or specify tool rails , where it can be specified , which actions on this or other toolbar should be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , additional action and action are displayed that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings toolbar ... and set up settings .. .
&quot; templates are basically like a usual document skel@@ eton , code car@@ vings and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; templates are basically like a usual file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory to the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you imagine for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are available in the template tree under global templates .
&quot; documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specialized documents are found in appropriate sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates . see in for more information about the Tem@@ plates tree . &quot;
this kind of templates is useful when not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted into the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples are to be found in the template tree under global templates . see in for more information about the Tem@@ plates tree .
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve for entire websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure according to Bel@@ i@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As a template Save As local template ... &quot;
&quot; once it has been done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template does not appear in the project tree . look in the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; choose text in your document and click File As a template save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be dra@@ gged with dra@@ gging and dro@@ pping on the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; creating binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as drag and drop or paste via the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree . &quot;
&quot; in the file tree or in the project files , you can click a folder on the right and create site template , select a name for the template , but of course it can be stored in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very pur@@ pos@@ eful approach . you can create head@@ lines and foot@@ ers , or dynamically link them with &amp; PHP ; create , add files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the Tem@@ plates Tem@@ plates is based on the files submitted in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates .
to specify the behavior of a folder in the template overview with the right mouse button click on the folder and select Properties from the context menu . the following dialog appears :
&quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is low as soon as el@@ ental attributes are inherited . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits for anything except the regular folders in the template list . if a root folder is set so , it would be explicitly enabled in this path unless it would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you &apos;ll probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers by copying contents templates into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor that can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL editor and the second editor spl@@ its the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL editor .
the V@@ PL editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ Page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and switch back if required to the source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL editor . to edit &amp; PHP , the source code editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first one , except that the changes are visible in both the source text editor and in the V@@ PL editor . pressing F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , the key pressure is activated from one window to another , whereby the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL editor and the source text editor can be adjusted via settings Qu@@ anta . depending on the choice of V@@ PL , you can select between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small span for fast hosts and a large span for slow . &quot;
&quot; assuming that you want to change the title of the website , the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL editor . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL editor . &quot;
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons at the bottom . a click in the list allows changing the content , e.g. keywords on the column names and keywords keyword 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons under the list . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; the use of the cursor is possible , as in a word processor , by moving with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor acts as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted using back button or remo@@ ver key . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the toolbar , as in the source text editor . it is important to note that inser@@ ting tags already existing identical tags will not be removed e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag . &quot;
&quot; some toolbar like the tables assistant or the Listen @-@ Wiz@@ ard are disabled . they will later be in the &amp; V@@ PL ; work , in this release the tables or lists must be used . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for examining breast@@ feeding systems . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style of style can be pursued . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; to compile successfully , except for &amp; k@@ de ; the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already existing . &quot;

&quot; in this command , a partial or entire match is checked with a presentation named QNAP or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template matches each QNAP &apos;s template containing the template . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; will be extended by the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a sought @-@ after point has to be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically executed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stops are checked shortly after the start of each run .

on systems with installed Re@@ ad@@ line library you can browse through the arrow keys on / off by the running memory of the previously executed commands .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass compound expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : using the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument a holding point is set in a file called &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; . &quot;

there are many graphical tools for comparing . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I have written .
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation . another program@@ mer had changed a lot of text in the same file . &quot;
&quot; the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there were no references to the places where only the ind@@ entation had changed . the mer@@ ging of these changes was a little night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences in a line and changes in white marks . later a lot of other useful functions have been added .
&quot; for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison window . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ featured file browser .
also 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is fully supported . this is useful when two persons work independently of one piece of code and make changes . in this editor you can edit the result even directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder mer@@ ging :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and reflects the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check code , you will like this function . &quot;
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more anno@@ ying when somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make the typ@@ ing work easier by writing only the fil@@ ename of the first file . example : &quot;
diff@@ use Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 -@@ o Dest@@ ination folder k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 folder 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 folder 3 folder 3 -@@ o destination folder
&quot; open dialog allows you to manually typ@@ ing fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons and merge of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for B and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ ename from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if merged , the input field is active for target and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to immediately set an output file . you can do this step later when saving . &quot;
the Setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
&quot; which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains , for example , several similar features . if you want to find out how similar these features are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would need to create two corresponding files , they in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; upload and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , you can do nothing out &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; pull out . only the dro@@ pping of text into a comparison window is supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret dra@@ gging and dro@@ pping text into another program than cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ ename and line number of the first visible row in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach Info row has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse get a while over the line . ) then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is recognized , one can see the color that differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) well . &quot;
&quot; when differences are found , the color displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line that separates the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is activated , the line is dotted with frac@@ tional lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( under the comparison window ) also has an info row with the wor@@ ding output : , the fil@@ ename and &#91; changes &#93; when you have edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the Save is down@@ lighted ! ! ! ( use the buttons jump to next solved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two comparative windows are used , each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ) This group will then highlight the current group . it will be highlighted with the color background color for current pane , and each on the left will appear a black beam . &quot;
&quot; sometimes by automatic mer@@ ging or by manual editing , no more row is left in the group ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; no row in the source file ; this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you might copy and elsewhere . &quot;
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflicts ; appears however in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function .
&quot; note : when selecting the sources , ignor@@ ing the options or ignor@@ ing Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side up , start , end , Ctr@@ l @-@ start and Ctr@@ l end , Si@@ w like you are used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the menu window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the Add button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns , the view of all windows will be synchron@@ ized to the beginning of each group ( as described in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( Ctr@@ l @-@ down / Str@@ g picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous un@@ solved conflict . therefore , the conflict between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( Ctr@@ l @-@ C or Ctr@@ l @-@ Insert ) . however , this option is automatically copied to the clip@@ board and removes manual copying . be careful with this option , as you may acci@@ dentally over@@ ride the contents of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use a new@@ line + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the line @-@ ends of the source files , therefore you should also not use bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of recently used files will be automatically saved during loading and restored to the next start . ( menu Set@@ ting - &gt; K@@ R@@ 3 setup ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; when you enable this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the chosen type@@ face does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors might not be available in their pure form but would be illustrated . on these systems , the Pre@@ ferences button automatically creates an un@@ just color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the number of spaces is inserted by pressing the tab@@ ul@@ ator button . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . copy the manual copy to the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used choice on the operating system used .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white marks are ignored . in this step , white characters are ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a car return mark &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only save a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . if this option is checked , the cart will be disabled , but this option has to be disabled . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the option is activated in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in auto @-@ jump mode , this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; this is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , then use the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . &quot;
these options are discussed in the chapter on scanning of folders and performing a merge . see for details under documentation on the directory comparison and mer@@ ging .
&quot; if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version will be app@@ ended with the suff@@ ix .@@ original . if already such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ OR@@ G exists , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; change the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you must &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; stop and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set global over the control center . ) &quot;
&quot; the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; above the selection fields for the encoding , a short note of what the local encoding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding for saving is to be used . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre@@ processors . &quot;
switch this to supp@@ ress up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of changes in white characters in the text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files will be displayed . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ GT ; C or B &amp; lt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ GT ; C will be displayed next to the normal view column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just leave the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes view the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files . current file merge in the merge menu also works if you only use two files . ( if this function is used to restart the merge operation then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
&quot; when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your needs . you can use this function , for example , to cut out dis@@ rup@@ tive parts or to correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is passed first to this external command . if there is also a normal pre @-@ processing command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only with line comparison . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed and most users don &apos;t want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the \ \ \ \ \ \ ( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically add generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword generated text $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ $ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it &apos;s good as an example for a further processing command for new@@ line comparison . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and any hits will be replaced by nothing so virtually er@@ ased .
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from one another . example :
&quot; instead of sed you can also use something else such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needed , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for the display and to merge . the subsequent operations only change the data that the new@@ line al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m sees .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
&quot; pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hi@@ des differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge complete folders in recur@@ sively . &quot;
... make a suggestion for each object ; you can customize the proposal before start
... can simul@@ ate the merge and display the simulated changes without really performing it
&quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog .
&quot; when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder was specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not the mer@@ ging . to start the merge , select the corresponding menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be informed about a small news window about current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files are listed which have been compared until then . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
each file and folder that has been found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - or double @-@ clicking on the object or by double @-@ clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the folder menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories can be opened and all sub@@ directories can be opened and un@@ fold .
&quot; when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the symbol in column Name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about any problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns . &quot;
&quot; for identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . in folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
&quot; the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B one file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B one file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; mode to synchron@@ ize is active if only two folders and no explicit destination folder has been specified , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that afterwards both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for output file only B ; copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of mer@@ ging ( uns@@ afe ) , then sc@@ rut@@ in@@ 3 ; the date of the files and displays the newer file for copying . if the files are different , but the date is identical . if such errors are not removed , the merge of folders cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; while mer@@ ging , one file will be processed after the other . it displays last time when mer@@ ging has been successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected occurs . when mer@@ ging is completed , you should make a final check and check if the status is fine anywhere . &quot;
&quot; if in the Setup dialog the file comparative method is selected Full Analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display other columns . ( the column for solved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the just selected entry ( file or odd ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the assembling actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not have a destination folder , then in the Three Fol@@ der merge mode C is used as a target , in the two folder merge , B is chosen as target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as a target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries to be in the destination folder can also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options through which certain entries could be ski@@ pped . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the folder menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current entry : select Action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by conf@@ lic@@ ting file types still invalid multiple actions exist , a message appears that indicates the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options Exec@@ ute , Sim@@ ulate and Cancel . &quot;
choose Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge @-@ window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select again to start / continue directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . then , performs &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work will continue with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before you continue mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged individually , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) will not work together again . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered to be completed . only if you change the merge operation , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ R@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory mer@@ ging with these options :
only files that fit on the given pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . there can be more than one pattern entered . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . there can be more than one pattern entered . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many auto @-@ generated files are ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this folder can be configured specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems a previous dot marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether to display these files in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; with links to files : when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively examined . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ) will examine the links like normal folders and recur@@ sively examined . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; this option would result in an endless loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( give a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage does not cost you a certain level of security . &quot;
&quot; there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical when they are equal . this can , for example , be useful when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is turned off in default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no target folder has been specified . in this mode , the results for mer@@ ging files are selected in such a way that afterwards both folders are identical . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging , copying the newer file will be suggested as action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another folder , then the original version is renamed and receives the extension .@@ original If an old backup file with the .@@ original extension is already existing , it will be deleted without further backup . this also concerns the normal merge of single files , not only the mer@@ ging of entire folders . this option is turned on in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge view will remain visible for the mer@@ ging of single files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can turn off the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory &amp; text window . &quot;
&quot; you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . as soon as you save the result , the status will be added directly , and the file will not be merged once again when you start the folder merge . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory : &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ R@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . this allows you to specify files and folders that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things should be considered :
&quot; a path can be relatively und@@ one or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it can not be discrimin@@ ated whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file is always accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit permissions or change date . therefore , the permissions or change date from the original devi@@ ate . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ ality of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of use is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select in the context menu in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in case the input file is a patch file in unified format . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch file to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports compar@@ isons of two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ fam@@ 2 ( now there are comp@@ are ) already exists . furthermore the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already points out that it can merge as the program diff@@ use from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I &apos;ve been using GPL programs for a long time and have learned a lot while I &apos;ve looked into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or going to it .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and probably not shared the configure script to K@@ DE . in default configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE does not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; if only a non @-@ white mark is different , the line is treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is is often the case . &quot;
&quot; this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file , and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could save this information . &quot;
you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text should be used another editor .
after removal of text it is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c lin@@ ts ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use already many colors to highlight differences . even more up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or higher .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the last changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
&quot; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot;
K@@ DE @-@ dir sets the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are uncertain you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
&quot; there &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties occur , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of it . &quot;
cut out ( Ctr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copied to the clip@@ board and delet@@ es the selected text . inser@@ ting ( Ctr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ Pa@@ ste ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position or replaces the current selection .
&quot; show only differences : files that are identical in all folders are not in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder . &quot;
( in the current program version you have to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . )
&quot; this also causes identical files to be copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder doesn &apos;t already contain those files , they are missing after the merge . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button accordingly . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is down@@ lighted . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nails of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop , to change their size , to stop them or move them . this works both within a working area and at several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running therein . applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and to others .
the middle mouse button allows you to move windows within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a work@@ space and on other working surfaces .
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu has only the two entries p@@ ager . if however , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries are minim@@ izing , maxim@@ izing , On Desktop and Finish . the commands cause the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , window can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working surfaces . &quot;
&quot; when this box is checked , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed . &quot;
&quot; cross this field leaves the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is shown together with name indicate , the names are provided with ord@@ al numbers , and eg ; 1 . work area . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the background of each desktop will be shown as background in the &amp; p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the running programs will be shown as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed to allow their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rectang@@ les with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default icon and Pix@@ map displays a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; p@@ ager ; the main window can be determined : classi@@ cally let &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid , all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops appear in a horizontal and vertical right in a vertical row , which is very well suited for display later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
&amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size to display and move the windows as icons or with their contents .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up the settings of the switch ... allows the dialog to appear .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have a write permission for the file , you need to log in as user root or turn to your system administrator . in this file you must enter the key wind@@ ow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and assign it to this one . possible values are : &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users : artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance calcul@@ ators .
&quot; if you like &amp; k@@ like ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fying window . the image that is displayed in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a drop @-@ down window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; mag ; the area around the mouse po@@ inter such as a mobile magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ like ; to make a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop @-@ down mode ) or the environment of the mouse po@@ inter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse po@@ inter is displayed in the enlarged pane , select the setting mouse po@@ inter . please note that &amp; k@@ likes ; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse po@@ inter . this is always the standard node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cursor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button down so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
&quot; if you are using the Shift + Shift key or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the drop down window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains tight and only the bottom right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
starts or stops updating the ad . stopping the update causes the necessary CPU time to go against 0 .
&quot; select the refresh rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected area will be shown in a window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your typ@@ ed short commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , new@@ bie ( with the button Document again loaded in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Ver@@ small@@ ness &amp; etc ; . &quot;
&quot; also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can also use an area of screen magni@@ fier , so as if you would use a magni@@ fier in order to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual han@@ di@@ caps . &quot;
you can find more detailed user documentation with help : / k@@ mag ( either enter this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ help@@ Center help : / k@@ mag ) .

&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse po@@ inter has been har@@ med for a while at the same place . it is intended to help people suffering from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury Syndrome ) and which every mouse click causes pain .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse po@@ inter has been har@@ med for a while at the same place . it is intended to help people who suffer from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that arises while clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , suffering from pain associated with using your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to clarify this again : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for each . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you break the movement briefly .
&quot; the intelligent slide activ@@ ates , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; take a break after it em@@ ulated the pressing of the mouse button . move now the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button is executed . in this way you can run the dra@@ gging with pressed mouse button . the intelligent move requires a little practice , but you get used quickly . &quot;
&quot; this time of residence must be stored after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; if intelligent moves are switched on , the shooting field is active ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button wait before it release the mouse button again , if there is no moving over time . &quot;
&quot; this function activ@@ ates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double @-@ click . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double @-@ click . this moves are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound appears , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there sound system and here the rider General . there is a slider Sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , becomes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically there . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset to the last push of the user . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the intelligent move should leave you off . if you are ac@@ custom@@ ed to the automatic mouse click , you can later remove the intelligent slide . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it might be necessary to reduce the response times by &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware at which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or in places in the browser window that does not link leads to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such points until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually quite simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the rollers that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you need to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . but it should be clear when you view the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can easily scra@@ pe the dirt and dirt with a flat blade or finger nail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just started an im@@ position , it means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click . hereby , the status of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be reset and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and move the cursor to another location . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it . but use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse po@@ inter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the head@@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent move is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to select text to copy it to the clip@@ board , or to move it back into the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; do not use the intelligent slide if you are just starting to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click at the end of the text area and keep the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse po@@ inter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . thus each time , when &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is played ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click away . so you know exactly when when you move the wrong move . later , you can use the intelligent move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window has to be installed . this should already be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is set up correctly .
&amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse po@@ inter is short . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome and those affected by the pressing of the mouse buttons .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to allow a certain time to start a pulling process before releasing the mouse button . in this way , dra@@ gging and dro@@ pping can be performed with the mouse . &quot;
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ( either enter this &amp; URL ; in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ help@@ Center help : / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ) .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with which the dum@@ b user can let their computers speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation course phrases that are to be spoken again .
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . for more details see the description of the setup catalogue . &quot;
on the second page you can choose the standard Tex@@ tp@@ as@@ say book . you can choose frequently used text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
&quot; on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary of Wor@@ ter@@ feed . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the Wor@@ ds . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your phrases ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a course memory of the spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have a k@@ mouth ; properly setup , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is app@@ ended to the default memory . you can select phrases that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu item Pre@@ p mouth ; setting up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two map cards , speech output and settings , page Wor@@ ter@@ crossing as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the map display , enter the command to call the generator . in the selection field under the input field , set the character encoding that the text is passed on to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass text . select the check box , if the text remains unchanged as default input to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command for voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation on your language generator . &quot;
&quot; the kt@@ op@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; the kt@@ op@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; the kt@@ op@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; the kt@@ op@@ d language service is a standard interface for voice output , and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage from the Text passage menu or in the bar for text strings . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of instant messages , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and added in addition to the course memory . with the selection of Add to the input field , the selected text passage is first entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop @-@ down box of the editing window for Tex@@ tp@@ as@@ sa@@ gen@@ buch , you can specify whether the text book register is automatically saved when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; save the book . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the Tex@@ tp@@ as@@ sa@@ gen@@ buch is not saved . select Before saving , it becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the Tex@@ tp@@ as@@ sa@@ gen@@ buch is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can select the currently used Dic@@ tionary for Dic@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; with buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot;
&quot; select the language desired for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; the frequency of each word is simply retri@@ eved by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; this option lets you create a new , empty dictionary without any entries . since &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically inserts into the dictionary , you can create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
the main area of the window for editing text string books is divided into two . in the upper part the text panel books are represented as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage paper@@ back , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books either by selecting either the menu bar , the toolbar or through a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
the order of text string books or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding toolbar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the toolbar is set by default over the editing pane directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the shad@@ ed left side and drag the toolbar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is checked , a narrow margin in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; shown if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar for text string books with entries is displayed . the bar is arranged by default over the editing pane directly under the toolbar . by clicking on the shad@@ ed left side and drag the toolbar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; probably you have not entered the command for the speech output correctly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; setup ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for voice output on the map display . ( see Settings dialog for Voice Synthes@@ izer for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; Festival is a language edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that Festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in &amp; Java . currently it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to transmit without restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ etz folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option has to be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es to a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to split the text into phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free of non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax will gladly swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be app@@ ended . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
&quot; the voice output da@@ emon by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further voice service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems . &quot;
&quot; since the language generator setting is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use t@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; adjust . &quot;
use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page that appears in the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
&quot; about &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully use , you need a language generator ( and course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak to let text be issued by the computer . a list of already scann@@ ed sets is stored , which the user can re @-@ publish again and again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no synthes@@ izer includes . a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .
&quot; more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( either enter this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , or restart the help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module consisting of modules that allows any application to read text about the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmers with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS capabilities .
&quot; reading of texts ( or parts of them ) in the text editor &amp; kate ; , even if &amp; kate , embedded in others &amp; k@@ de ; applications . &quot;
&quot; speech output is done by the speech speech tool , which uses different background programs such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows generation of voice output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ Help program .
&quot; in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Speech mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Speech @-@ mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the voice @-@ overs service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setting of kt@@ op@@ d over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
&quot; a module for the text editor , with which a text file can be read completely or in part . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database from &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ats ; in the k@@ de @-@ accessibility mailing list . subscribe to the list of htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility . &quot;
&quot; before you can use it , you need to install and configure program speech @-@ pat@@ cher . &quot;
&quot; at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speaker is set up , the map map will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the map card will be displayed in general . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you should at least set up a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ats ; use as the program speed dis@@ pat@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker . &quot;
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are similar to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the card @-@ runner speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the map card spokes@@ person will appear . this will appear automatically when you start kt@@ y@@ m@@ gr and not yet set up a speaker . &quot;
all the already established speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not give a speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also defines their priority . &quot;
click on any of these buttons to make your changes to the running &amp; desktop system .
&quot; choose a tuning type here , there are three male and three female voices and a boys and girls &apos; voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; click Edit . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ats ; already almost use . go back to the map card in general and check if language output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled so that the T@@ TS service is enabled by &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ats ; use to create text files . see .
&quot; if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language training system of &amp; k@@ de ; click on the map roller reiter General to open this map card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to enable the &amp; t@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the map map will be displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marker , hold K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is finished , runs &amp; t@@ ts ; further , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is checked . &quot;
&quot; this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically when reading in the system section of the control bar , it dis@@ appears again as soon as the reading is completed . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series you can start , cancel , stop and res@@ ume text orders . &quot;
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for one job .
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages . &quot;
&quot; the map @-@ card orders will only be shown if K@@ TT@@ SD was launched . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map roller reiter General and tick the voice output here ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , web browser by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check if &amp; t@@ ts ; then select the text that should be read before and select Tools text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML tags and other invisible marks are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . first check if &amp; t@@ ts ; then select the text that should be read before and select Tools text in the main menu . then , the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works when &amp; kate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
&quot; K@@ not@@ i@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , which noti@@ fies you about the events you have established . you can read the text of this news also by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . you can , for example , set up a message where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ats , you can then read the IR@@ C news text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ not@@ i@@ fy , a menu entry noti@@ fies noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ not@@ i@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail .@@ x@@ ml , which is included in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ats , is a good example . it removes the tags br and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box as it can be assumed in most cases as provided . read also . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal working with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filters , text is edited before it is sent to the speech tool pat@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , to replace wron@@ g@@ ly spoken words or short@@ cuts , to select a suitable language and speaker or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of text . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is pre @-@ drawn to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the continued orders will be continued . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be res@@ um@@ ed after the issue of the warning .
&quot; a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses news . while you can read a long text on a web page , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; anyone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news . read more . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text @-@ orders . every order you get from the map is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of applications that uses text orders . text @-@ orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which do not have any particular ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four orders are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader while &amp; t@@ ts ; just such a read , this output is stopped and ended . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text jobs as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages . &quot;
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there are still more types of filters available .
substitute strings replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ats ; is provided with pre@@ defined string substitute filters such as : - ) by text or for converting messages from &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use a X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . included in the scope of delivery ; some X@@ S@@ LT files are included in the translation of &amp; XHTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with speaker selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ats ; for example , if you have set a female voice on the map menu , you can read text from K@@ DE news about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to voice output . if the filter pres@@ ets that its rules don &apos;t apply , it will pass the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters arranged on the bottom . editing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the usual filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the following setup di@@ alogs will be displayed below .
&quot; for the creation of strings of strings you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged against the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as desired , it only has to be distinguished from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column matches and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is processed in the order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file will be app@@ ended to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here a language is entered , the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages if you click the &quot; &quot; Ctr@@ l &quot; &quot; key when you click . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID of running programs is available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if , for example , and q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter copied . &quot;
&quot; the string replacement filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions match an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s Word \ \ s. the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ S@@ LT files from a format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such trans@@ formations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility has to be installed on your system .
&quot; enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is available about the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient . &quot;
&quot; with the speaker selection filter , you can send text to a certain speaker that is set up on the map speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . you can for example define that text by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; handed a text to the filter , it is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker characteristics that the program sends , that sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ats ; with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ ride the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; here a value is entered , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can call this one by clicking on the button to get help in entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; specify the characteristics of the speaker specified by you . if the text meets the filter conditions described above , the speaker is selected to meet the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to display the dialog box selection . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your speech settings or delete all settings .
the speech input filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the program@@ mer to give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the synthes@@ izer can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can use . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface the voice output API from &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility webpage ( http : / / accessi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from kt@@ op@@ d via the object K@@ Speech to .
&quot; text of the text for reading and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you give
&quot; open two &amp; console ; -@@ windows . just start t@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the above synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Re@@ duc@@ er filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that SA@@ BLE does not work at all . you have to do that yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found about the environment variable PAT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain signs or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that entire sentences are ski@@ pped or only cow@@ hide is spent . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string replace filter . &quot;

&quot; English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio . &quot;
K@@ T@@ TS also works with any speech synthes@@ izer which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
&quot; the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , drag the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . check also on the site of kt@@ ts ; , for information which is not yet included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses an adap@@ table modular architecture for speech synthes@@ izer . if you want to expand and use a different synthes@@ izer , please contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML conversion filter , but it is not mandatory . x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command . &quot;
&quot; to compile and to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the developer files for the program &quot; &quot; speech @-@ pat@@ cher &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you are obtaining the source code from &amp; kt@@ ats ; from the source code archive for k@@ ad@@ obe , or download the tar@@ ball created every night , install and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use it , first check if speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher works with your synthes@@ izer correctly . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ats ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ats ; the program kt@@ y@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the introduction of speech dis@@ pat@@ cher is directly possible , and the sp@@ d @-@ conf will no longer be needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is divided into individual sets . the user can return sentence or sentence , repeat or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; if an application reads text at &amp; kt@@ ats , it can request the characteristics of the preferred speaking speaker for the output . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose sex is feminine , this will automatically be the best matching speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; t@@ ts ; select a speaker , see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click Add Sub@@ mit on the map tab , and thus enter a speaker in the list or click Edit , the map menu will display spokes@@ person setup . for example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown in the following . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PAT@@ H , you just have to enter a festival . &quot;
&quot; select the encoding for text that is passed to festival . if votes which are &amp; t@@ ts are known , this setting will be automatically made . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these slider you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a few controllers and display them grey , the voice selected by you does not leave these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n @-@ Vo@@ ices require several seconds to be loaded by their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so ( with larger memory usage ) the first set is synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or do not forget to click App@@ ly ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr program window is displayed when starting t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr icon in the system section is visible after the start , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr still does not run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control it . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the currently processed set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the map speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can set the instructions in the order , which is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or reset . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the OK button , all changes in the settings ( also on the other map cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but rather AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map . see also . &quot;
&quot; only text @-@ orders are listed and administr@@ ated here . editions of screen readers , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts can be found in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ats ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can &apos;t load the required libraries . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; set the speaking speed here . 50@@ 0.1 % corresponds roughly half and 200@@ cm ; % of the double normal speaking speed . in order for these settings to be implemented , the program must be installed so@@ x . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the running &amp; running system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you have to find out which device works for you . in doubt choose standard .
&quot; on this map , you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of speech records : &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is pre @-@ drawn to all other orders and holds these orders . after the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders will be res@@ um@@ ed . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next higher priority . this stage is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning will keep the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be res@@ um@@ ed after reading the warning .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you can read a long text on a web page , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless greet someone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ats ; the audio output in the queu@@ e . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map are only valid for normal text jobs . for messages , al@@ erts and the output of screen readers , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
to leave with &amp; kt@@ ats ; K@@ not@@ i@@ fy messages to be read before start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click Not@@ i@@ fications . the map notification appears .
&quot; select this check box to disable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; disable this setting . if this setting is not checked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ats ; reads no noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , will be al@@ erts where a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message before , the &amp; con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when somebody men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is stated in the list , are ignored . &quot;
use this check@@ box to specify what &amp; t@@ ts ; to do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
&quot; when you select Custom Text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; you can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker . default sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed as the top entry in the list on the map menu . see also . &quot;

&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling voice , speech velocity , voice and pitch control . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ats ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone ( sti@@ cally male ) voice , because this is the default voice , the festival is used when issu@@ ing SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if settings for speed or tone in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ x@@ ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and set limits filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . SB@@ Ds can start to split text into single sentences , not the entire text order . this allows you to start or stop the entire text order , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not directly support this . &quot;
&quot; here you see the line limit detection filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; a set @-@ level recognition filter is set up automatically as a pres@@ et . you can change its settings or add additional set limits marker filters , but beginners will get away from it . &quot;
&quot; on the map menu assignments , which speaker &amp; kt@@ ats are selected , change some features and check how the speaker &apos;s choice changes . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ats ; then start reading faster with reading , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long &quot;
&quot; you can then request or cancel text orders on the map map , even if the synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal set limit detection filter will be automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be shut off , only removed . change nothing in this filter unless you know what you do . &quot;
&quot; set limits recognition filter compare text with a regular expression for set @-@ ends , and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ator characters are removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set @-@ limit recognition filter maintains the character setting . &quot;
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ messages ( k@@ notify ) , al@@ erts , messages , or the output of screen readers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal code recognition filter from default , you can paste it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the map menu , you can over@@ write the subscri@@ ber settings for the application . &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the map ) . in other words : no speaker characteristics are specified .
&quot; use of the most appropriate speaker , which has all the characteristics of a set of speakers . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ats ; this speaker . otherwise oses &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that most likely comp@@ lies with the originally set characteristics . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired subscri@@ ber properties by clicking on one of the short@@ cuts .
&quot; select the characteristics of the desired subscri@@ ber here . if this property does not matter , enter nothing . &quot;
select this check box if the property should have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set up multiple mark@@ ers here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a prime property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you possibly want to specify the attribute language is before , if you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the features in the field speaker , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the drop @-@ down button and use speaker that is closest to the speaker . &quot;
in this case 0 is for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a job number . ( without the order number the input 0 is required ) .
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I compiled de@@ bug support , but I do not get back trac@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; t@@ aut ; it was stopped . probably you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not resolved by this , a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I receive a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a . on the &amp; console ; appears a message stating : un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem is that conflicts occur in AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . see the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) on www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
I have downloaded an additional voice for Festival from the Internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival but t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will not display this voice .
&quot; add $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / f@@ estiv@@ al@@ int / voices the new voice . as a guide , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL . &quot;
&quot; on the card board audio there is a setting speed . for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be search@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some Synthes@@ iz@@ ers modul@@ s like Festival Interactive can offer a setting for speed even on the card file for intercom device . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ats ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML ; ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite courage@@ ous , change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML conversion filter , and set up the speech speed . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ats ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the tag SA@@ BLE GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . to make festival no fault , the x@@ s@@ l file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber sets the GEN@@ DER tag . the same applies to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
I have added a custom string replacement filter and now I can go into &amp; kt@@ ats ; no longer set forward or backward . on the card @-@ runner orders it is shown that the order exists only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
&quot; you may not filter any punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter for bor@@ der@@ line recognition instead . &quot;
Al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.7 or later . note : make sure the G@@ Stre@@ amer modules are registered by using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts . ( http : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience conflicts with the audio output in connection with AL@@ SA . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and start a text . if your system also includes a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence will be read yet . &quot;
the audio program so@@ x is used for general setting of speech speed but is otherwise not mandatory . Debian users can install so@@ x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .
&quot; have you download &amp; kt@@ ats ; as tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , log in as normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a matching folder . go to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or created at least only on request .
the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Debian distribution ) . the configure column provides the configure parameter that causes the rise of the creation .
&quot; default is &amp; kt@@ ts ; in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 installed . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify as option --@@ pre@@ fix = destination . for example &quot;

&quot; before you use the synthes@@ izer , check first if your synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions that you received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers , whose source code is disclosed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on . &quot;
&quot; this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must vote for the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . choose a C@@ yr@@ il@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit C@@ yr@@ il@@ lic just like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then , Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from &quot;
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates voice from di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival generates this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from German text di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
&quot; in this procedure , additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the Festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; instead , in the folder festival / lib / . &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a changed version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; , then download MS German Festival of &quot;
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , playback of bug fixes is not required , you only need to re@@ compile festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;
&quot; ( voice @-@ location &quot; &quot; german _ de@@ 1 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; German Male , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; German Female , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; on some systems , you need to edit / etc / f@@ estiv@@ al@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . &quot;
this procedure uses special code to issue the language about festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; get and install first Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure that both work . then download Festival @-@ Czech of
extract the program with tar to a matching folder and create the dictionary . the exec@@ utable file festival must be located in your PAT@@ H .

&quot; Festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ id speech synthes@@ izer , which currently only supports a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple synthes@@ izer with still sufficient voice quality . &quot;
&quot; Fl@@ ite is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions , so search for Fl@@ ite first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; Ha@@ di@@ Fix@@ ture is a two @-@ stage synthes@@ izer which works with Di@@ ph@@ ons . the t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o program transl@@ ates text into Di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; speech synthesis is good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages . you can set voice , pitch , speech speed and volume via kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . &quot;
load at least one German language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Page and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip into the / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA folder .
&quot; copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ phor@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ phor@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ ename . &quot;

&quot; EP@@ OS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ id speech synthes@@ izer for the Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple synthes@@ izer with still sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ats , you can only adjust the volume in this synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and EP@@ OS T@@ TS speech synthes@@ izer . if the EP@@ OS programs are not in your PAT@@ H , enter the program on the map menu . in the input fields you can enter additional parameters for the programs . enter in a &amp; console ; epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ id language synthes@@ izer , written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you must install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; neither pitch , volume nor chat speed can be set . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ats ; with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in a console ; on the command line . &quot;
best use a command that writes the voice output into a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device
&quot; this manual explains the installation and usage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows the management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation a new module network settings will be displayed in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu ;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ s.@@ conf will display the device at all and enabled the setting of the network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed in the installation of &amp; Linux ; installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adapting the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
the network settings module is loaded when the option network settings are selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings this tries to detect the used platform on the system automatically .
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list that best matches the distribution and the release date . by selecting the setting non @-@ re@@ petition , the definition can be made permanently . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system administration mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , which means changing is not possible . by clicking the button system administration mode , you can access the system administration mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
the tab of network interfaces is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the Rider network interfaces :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... setup in the dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . &quot;
&quot; with automatic mode TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode TCP / IP settings for the system will be carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further configuration is required . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Manu@@ ell , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
network devices can be activated or switched off if required . switching a disabled network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off if required . disable an enabled network device by selecting from the list and selecting an interface ...
&quot; speci@@ fies the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which conve@@ ys the physical connection to remote networks and is used as standard for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected . &quot;
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requires http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org DNS records this name to an IP address like 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
&quot; the name resolution machine , part of the name resolution , allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be ordered by selecting an entry and up or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons up or down in the priority . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the Add button ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog . &quot;
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button . the Edit dialog is displayed . &quot;
&quot; the list of particular known hosts describes computer name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used on bo@@ oting if no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list contains name @-@ known hosts some entries that are &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and support some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add ... Add New Ali@@ as dialog .
&quot; enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the known calcul@@ ator has several alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a particular known computer from the list and select Edit ... The Modi@@ fied machine dialog will be displayed .
&quot; it can be performed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the Network Set@@ ting module are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , you need to set the following command . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface like k@@ package or the install tool of its distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation is sufficient for Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally the development packages with libraries and others are required . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second , all configuration files will be discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ s.@@ com. &quot;
this section does not substitute additional knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found great dis@@ semination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is therefore currently concentr@@ ating on the IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is knowing the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator can be used to assign a valid IP address or if available , DH@@ CP can be used . &quot;
&quot; when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore their arbitrary use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . the default route is required for IP forwarding . &quot;
&quot; the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circuit . &quot;
in this section you will find the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ s.@@ conf and where they are stored in different distri@@ butions .
&quot; this file is sometimes dynamically changed with DSL connections , so it won &apos;t be surprised if there is a different content than specified there in case of active DSL connections . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is acci@@ dentally changed by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand than expected can therefore occur .

&quot; to enable or disable a task , select them , and specify the state with the Edit menu item . in@@ active tasks are marked with in@@ active in their description . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the task and select En@@ abled . make sure that program name , parameter and description are displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; to execute a task immediately , select it and then proceed to Edit Now . &quot;
&quot; to create a new environment variable , first select the variable folder . then go to the Edit New menu item . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the variable folder and select New ... or press Ctr@@ l ; N . &quot;
enter the name of the variable . you can also select one from the list of the most commonly used environment variables ; click the arrow next to the variable name field . these are :
to send e @-@ mails from the program to another as the usual address
&quot; as with the creation of new variables , changes are only made when the c@@ ron@@ tab was saved . &quot;
&quot; to trim a variable , first select the variable to be removed . then go to Edit . &quot;
&quot; to copy an environment variable , first select the variable to be copied . then go to Copy . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right @-@ click on the variable and select Copy , or press Ctr@@ l ; C . &quot;

&quot; to change a variable , first select the variable to edit . then go to Edit Change .... alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the variable and modify ... Select , or press Ctr@@ l ; O .@@ It will then appear to edit variables in which , as described above , can edit the variable . &quot;
&quot; to delete an environment variable , first select the variable . then go to Edit Del@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; to enable or de@@ activate an environment variable , select it , and specify the state with the Edit menu item . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also right @-@ click on the variable and select En@@ abled . make sure the name and value of the variables are displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or changed , you still need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab file . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can press Ctr@@ l ; S . changes or additions to tasks or variables will only become active . &quot;
&quot; it appears the standard node ; print dialog . if you select output , see that there are two extra &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog . &quot;
prints the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have advanced permissions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the c@@ ron@@ tab command to change the time schedules of the user . &quot;
&quot; a PO@@ SIX compliant &amp; UNIX ; , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the base of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first objective was to create a surface for tar , which presented the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packaging . the second goal was to answer a question my wife asked : how much longer it takes to secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be included by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; educ@@ ate the band back and read the pre@@ st@@ ressing information of the band . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t know the pre@@ ten@@ se on the tape , you will be asked if the band should be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the default , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the band@@ index is to be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the band was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched through the opening of the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before casting a strap , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; there is a change of the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape is solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be kick@@ ed without danger .
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be form@@ atted by &amp; k@@ dat ; &quot;
&quot; a belt type must be form@@ atted before you can be used to save data . this process does not conform to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drive requires that a tape can be form@@ atted before use . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually require format@@ ting the tape , DAT drives are not . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; with format@@ ting the tape . all data on the tape are lost ! after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically included and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select in the Save menu ...
&quot; once the backup has been started , the dialog for f@@ use opens . in this dialog , you can check the selected files once and change the settings for the backup . &quot;
&quot; the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including data rate and time remaining . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click in any of the archives and select the menu entry Check ....
&quot; once the test procedure has been started , the dialog for review will appear . in this dialog you can review your selection and change the working folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and time remaining . &quot;
&quot; before you can re@@ direct the restore , the files to be recovered must be marked . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the files with a check@@ box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore from the menu .
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog for Recovery will appear . in this dialog you can review your selection and change the working folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the restore settings , the dialog will appear again . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and time remaining . &quot;
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file on the basis of the tape content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this volume . you can re @-@ create the index on two types of tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected work folder .
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files that are stored on the same file system are as the folder . folders that are on other file systems can be registered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file used to as@@ certain the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snap@@ shot file will be created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; gt ; &amp; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding variant of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command ms load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; to block the ej@@ ection from the tape drive . maybe this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , the connection of &amp; k@@ dat is turned on ; automatically dis@@ car@@ ded the tape . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy streaming . &quot;
&quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must notify &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a volume form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows : &quot;
the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds where the name is the full name of the system on which the tape is form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time when the tape was form@@ atted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar -@@ archives that can be managed directly with &amp; GNU / - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is embedded .
&quot; the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system provides the various protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access for example to information about problems encountered on their server . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your machine in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the log files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system sends the various protocol files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access for example to information about problems encountered on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; tries to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . among other things include : &quot;
support for many different types of log files for the format of Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screen@@ shots , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available with which the individual protocol rows of a protocol file can easily filter and sort . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will not show you , and it opens up rather than a small message window , so you have not started with system administrators . the protocol files usually do not have permission to read in the folder / var / log , for the normal user . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter strip to filter after a selected criteria or set string . the list of the log lines is now automatically displayed , so that only log lines will be displayed next to the filter . then a log line will only be displayed when the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns . &quot;
you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the Filter search term is then only offset with the entries in the corresponding column . for example in the log file system log the name of a process shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the key protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more noticeable color as protocol lines of level hint . the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off .
&quot; if you would like to show only a particular process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , you can see the process identification ( PID ) in the process . for example , this may be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command , such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter strip . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can use the option to jump to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new incoming log lines . &quot;
&quot; to use this feature , use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more information about the sources of information on &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; find also in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; - Subversion Archives : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; Archive
&quot; welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ) . this section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it is rapidly becoming the standard for control of program start @-@ up when running the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not go down here on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to install a machine on System V In@@ it without a re@@ installation and reform@@ at@@ ting . that &apos;s why you must make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
&quot; system services do not contain such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls are to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel looks at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first to find it .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default Run@@ Level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have confused some , then you will fix it by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and exec@@ uting the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that in this folder there are no right files . instead , each entry is linked to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : any of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument as start and stop . you can actually run these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the start . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server run@@ level that only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; running . furthermore , I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; using a mouse or other hand tool is simple to not say tri@@ vial : just drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start ( or stop it ) on this level .
you can also move between run @-@ level scripts or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else . this will only be removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if you remove an entry from the range of available system services .
&quot; note : entries will be moved when you move them to a new level . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly choose copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and add them to the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sort number of an entry can sometimes not be comp@@ uted . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the items you want before you try again to insert the system service . &quot;
note : at present there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the rec@@ ycle bin . so be careful .
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ul@@ ator button to activate the different working areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of above or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use Ctr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with Ctr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to manually change the sort number or the name of an entry , press the input button to change the properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; due to the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before exec@@ uting . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise they will be saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ ways , and now the machine starts an@@ ew . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; on the LI@@ LO , prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) . &quot;
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under run level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions facilitates configuration for the proprietary application programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not conform to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use another distribution , please check that all configuration files are available that are required by the system service ( and whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) are simply terminated without any message if their configuration files are not present or set up in@@ correctly . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even vary from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level , so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to save them . either you can use the appropriate icon of the toolbar or Save the Save in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two map cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some card cards are only displayed if you have made advanced system settings . only when you activate space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a map card will be created on which you can make individual settings . additional card cards appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD @-@ Unix . &quot;
&quot; the card file password management appears , if Shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD @-@ Unix . &quot;
&quot; this map display only appears if for at least one restricted file system space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the limit restrictions in KB : &quot;
this parameter can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected by means of the field fil@@ esystem with space limitation
the card ei@@ card groups are informed of the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group to which the user belongs can be found in the Pri@@ mary group . furthermore the user can be registered in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
&quot; the dialog features of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works analog . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO Boot@@ Manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change time to bo@@ oting of the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more . &quot;
