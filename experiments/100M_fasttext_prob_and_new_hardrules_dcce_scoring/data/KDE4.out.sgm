<seg id="10">"to use the crash module, click on the & konqueror; on Extras Transfers. then you can view the page that has & konqueror; or the list of crashes, if available, delete."</seg>
<seg id="11">The module Angle filter (also called folder filters) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras Anview Filters. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">"to use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Tools DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: documentElement, all other nodes are subelements of this root node."</seg>
<seg id="13">Module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various toolbars and text views in order to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportionate to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">"at & FSView, the size of a file or folder shows the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily recognized even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView can be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you are viewing."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView, an entry in the Trek representation is a rectangle represented by a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle that is switched over view color mode can be either deep for easy detection of the nesting depth or the illustration of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each feature, you can specify if there is enough space to display (where there is sufficient space for representation). furthermore, you can set the relative position of the caption in the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in case of representation algorithms for Treemaps the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the item. frames are drawn to represent the nesting of entries, and this frame will require space, which will then no longer be available to the subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square."</seg>
<seg id="20">"as splitting the space of an entry for the subordinate entries takes place, the implementation remains to be left to the implementation. in this case it is advisable for the labelling and avoidance of space losses due to frame always advantageous to create rectangles that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns or recursive division."</seg>
<seg id="21">"you can specify the minimum presented area for an entry over the menu item View Anders by area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry."</seg>

<seg id="62">You can also check out the digitized homepage to get news about released versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">"the best start to get involved & digitized; to participate, registration is in the developer mailing list. instructions for reporting in the developer mailing list of & digikam;."</seg>
<seg id="64">"when you start & check; for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. simply enter a path name or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder."</seg>
<seg id="65">"in the second field, you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data abnk is stored. this path will remain the same for all image folders."</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digitized; you will additionally use as an Albenbibliothek. settings digiKam set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">"if you already have a collection of images on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder containing pictures as base folders. & digitifs; see each subfolder as an album. no image is changed. while browsing the folder, you will get a progress report like this:"</seg>

<seg id="69">"if you are taking an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenlist do not have photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon."</seg>
<seg id="70">"once you have configured the base folder, you can set in & digiamp; set up your digital camera. then, you should learn how to use My Albums and My Keys to manage your photos in the albums."</seg>
<seg id="71">"raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, & digitized; may also deal with it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu."</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set this up and work with raw files is described in sections of raw decoder settings and raw processing.</seg>
<seg id="73">"an easy-to-use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digi.; of course, each medium and every card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digiback; work together."</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera is then released as a USB mass storage device. the camera can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">"& digitifs; uses the gPhoto2 program to communicate with digital cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial port for communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now outdated. & digitized; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images using gPhoto2. see this link for a complete list of supported cameras."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that the preview images of digiKam can be read reliably. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may not see thumbnails, or the generation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things in & digitized; is how easy it can expand its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI Modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (Manual) is a joint module structure for & digikam;, PhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can be a user. their advantage is that it is much easier, & digitized; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in & digitized themselves."</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore use it before attempting any further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">"normalizing, comparing, automatic matching and contrast expand from the Correcting Automatic correction menu try to automatically make the best out of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminous values over the entire picture so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">"comparisons: this method adjusts the luminance factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it only produces waste. it is a very powerful operation that either causes wonders in a picture or it destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light boundary tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete history gramming area."</seg>
<seg id="393">"contrast: this method improves contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range, and a rejiuscation of all values in between. this is only visible with washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos."</seg>
<seg id="394">White balance by & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to make white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a color space with 8-bit per color. if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, then your possibilities for correction are better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side, both the original image and the preview of the target image can be viewed. the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool's settings. if you want to see the original white balance again, then click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">Previewing the target photos has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"a histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with one button, you can decide whether any of the three colors or your sum is displayed."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will see the combined result in white balance. this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. any setting of the white balance that you have set can save you to a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences Panel sets all filter values back to its default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will result in another photo than your original. if you save this file your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">"8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this coding also needs more disk space, compute time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color-mapping can be done through the sub-window for the brightness. a detailed instruction for using color profiles can be consulted from chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time, so that you can always use them for multiple photos. this is useful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you will always need the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find in colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digitized; tool colour effects provide you with four colour effects, a solar thermal effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canister filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also known as Sabatier, was an effect of creating a partially developed pressure from the additional light. this had the effect that the lighter areas were darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negatively of the picture. this tool allows you to fine tune this interesting effect."</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase ultimately creates a negative image that so does not generate on photopaper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar system effect. the original image is the (1) and this is edited (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulated the so-called & quot; Velviaquire; effect. it differs from a saturation resulting in a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it easy to embellish lots of photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film produced by Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquote; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvias strongly saturated colors are also some photographers, especially those of the barely landscapes set up too much."</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neon filter simulates neonlight on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide reps the thickness of the neon light. for large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is not uncommon to correct the color contrast and the luminous intensity of the photos. you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you make a photo with poor lighting conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to preview the saturation rather than raising it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool is based on tone value correction for improvement of exposure. even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of the slider for the purpose of this tool. concrete the three sliders below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graph three sliders are clicked into the image and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controller and observe how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"on the right hand side, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is updated dynamically using the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">"scaling: with this selection box, it can be set whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis. for images of a digital camera the linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic division is more useful."</seg>
<seg id="424">"three knobs: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the bottom for the medium sounds, often called Gammavalues."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digitized; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"blur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper look. in fact, it doesn't work a bit, it works more psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapour and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is perhaps the best of the three as it really enhances the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus as well as most digitised images need a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitization process must be combined with only minimal differences to a color point. thus, the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more afterwards sharpening than normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"with JPEG pictures, a camera is often used in internal sharpening. pictures in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners already use a sharpening filter while reading the image. if you deactivate it you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening factory default. you can call this using the menu item Correct Sharing.</seg>
<seg id="487">"but they should be careful with this since the sharpness is not very natural: the sharpness increases sharpness of the edges, but also reinforces the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpen a picture is refocussing."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a bit softly is considerably easier than sharpen it. use the tool for softening with the menu item Correcting soft and experiment with some settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The blurry is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tested first. an increase in radius or amount reinforce the effect. if you make the unsharpened mask, noise and the impression of grenades can be generated close to sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore you should best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image which is added to the original. thus the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold is a break from the maximum of RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, zones with a soft change between the tones are applied to the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are exempted from sharpening and thus avoid flaw in faces, skies and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image is the (2). fuzzy masks were applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitized; tool refocused refocused a picture by enhancing the sharpness. it used the protected design filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying the image to sharpen. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese Filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening pictures is the use of a blur mask. refocus usually achieves better results than blurred masks. you can start it from the menu by refocusing color refocusing in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular circuit works much better than the Gauß'n" Circuit. the Gauß'n "Circuit has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result from the source pixel which is far from the original pixel pixel. in most cases, the FIR Viennese inverse of the Gauß's fission is greatly affected by the remote pixels."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular Focus: this is the radius of the circular circuit. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should yield 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very blurred, but should pay attention to halo notes."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be chosen by 0-1. useable values are 0.5 and values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filters: an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce artifacts. however, values are higher than 0.1. however, values are higher than 0.1. however, the picture quality is very bad. a usable value is 0,03. a high value will still contaminate the image."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the palate's sharpness. use this parameter if your infirmness Gauß 'is. in most cases, you should have this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value nonzero, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. increasing the size of the die can generate good results, especially if you select large values for the circle-shaped sharpness or the gauge's sharpness. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all the cuts, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations do not immediately make changes that are not immediately visible, but they will leave unpleasant artifacts later."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, blurry Masks produce better results than sharpening. this could be caused by blurred Masquerading a larger neighborhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in theory, blurry Masks always have to create artefacts. even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of blur. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied to a small unfocused image:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original blurred color image must be corrected. this image has been made with an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods of field correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The smoothie knob implements the roughness of the area of the darkened area in order to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the ink ink provides a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can adjust this here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools for removing unwanted artifacts with unparalleled speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting-painting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings fine, you can use the tab Gladdles and Advanced Settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"attention to detail p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothness over the picture. a value of 0.9 should be kept in such a way that no sharpening is required afterwards. please note that the attention should always be subordinated to the directional dependency."</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction addictive alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a film granulation or CCD trough will generate a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artifacts are best removed at a value near 1. "</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value suitable for the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it has to be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm will go through. usually here 1 or 2 suffices.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle stepping distance [5, 90]: Angular-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles produce a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral increments [0,1, 10]: integrated stride width in pixels. you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"linear interpolation use: the more of quality you receive by choosing this option is minimal. however, it doubles the runtime."</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and then loaded again.</seg>
<seg id="528">"correction of image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and draw a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how picture errors can be corrected with Small Artefakte. the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. as you can see there is a self-made black artifact in the foreground that caused by a poor film storage during the trip. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease noise. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove spots and other artefacts that come from dust or hairs on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moireacute; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial."</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">"in the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced Settings can stay with the default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore minor bugs."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel spacing the filter forward. if it is increased, noise peaks are reset. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details cannot be recovered and noise or lubrication stops again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not all the noise can be removed or noise points can occur. set it to a value close to the maximums if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifact without losing details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: check the luminance tolerances of the image. we recommend using either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend using either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas which are typically smoky. it also pollutes the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">"attenuation: controls adjustment of phase jitter attenuation. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is elevated, smokers and phase jitter appear on the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this."</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and then loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). noise reduction was applied using the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a bit softly is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use the tool to sharpen the menu item Correct soft and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digitized; Photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film granulation, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitised images."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the same algorithm can be used for dyeing and texturing. the texture mapping is performed with another tool, the image error correction, and the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="548">"reduce JPEG artifacts: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; artefact quot; - small standards that are seen in uncompressed picture. this setting should correct these problems."</seg>

<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>

<seg id="567">"wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not light the entire sensor area equally. instead, & quot; vignetting-quot; (shaded) they reduce the edges and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior."</seg>
<seg id="568">"many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which is impossible to hold the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise there are no sharper effects caused by movement."</seg>
<seg id="569">"with the large exposure areas of today's film and color or greyscale depth of digital cameras and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a rough image that without this filter is applied. the tool Vignetting Correction applies the transformation with a centerfilter on an image. the algorithm is protected by John Walker."</seg>
<seg id="570">"with three controls you can control the Vignetting Correction filter, and with three more exposure of the target image."</seg>
<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the degree of light gain damping at the point of the greatest density the filter. the standard density amounts to 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with an aperture of 1, or by chance of a light intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a larger degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree."</seg>
<seg id="572">"luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the Vignetting correction reduces the brightness of pixels. you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values because you only need to increase the settings."</seg>
<seg id="573">"if you want to re-adjust the exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminous intensity / contrast / gamma with zero and use the gradation from & digitized; image processing from the Color Gradation menu."</seg>

<seg id="575">The & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. coloured distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree deals with the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">"the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens off the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool."</seg>
<seg id="579">"the coefficient of fourth grades corrects the removed corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can almost be eliminated."</seg>
<seg id="580">"in general, this value controls the strength of distortion second grades. with negative values tonneneous distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion."</seg>
<seg id="581">"corner: this value controls the strength of distortion 4th grade. this value acts more strongly on the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameter' has the inverse sign of the parameter."</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value renders the image size and results in correcting the first degree of gravity. negative values increase while positive the picture is decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="583">"light: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase them."</seg>
<seg id="584">"to help you find the best filter settings, the dialog shows the distortion prefix. the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start."</seg>
<seg id="585">The Tonnel- or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all trimming or resizing. in case you re-cut a picture and then perform a spherical correction the effect would seem apparent to the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">"to help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal aid line. move it to an important location, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point."</seg>
<seg id="587">"if you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove it using the cutting tool in the menu Transforming trimming from image processing or using the Zoom knob of this dialog."</seg>
<seg id="588">"the next logical step for some motives, such as shots from the front, frames and paintings it is the perspective to correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees have. note that when you hold the camera with your hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective."</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the spherical correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">"the algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film from the GimpGuru.org website which is available at this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 IIR, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO."</seg>
<seg id="591">"in the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can look at the effect on different parts of the image."</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters set of film granulation and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the option Add film granulation if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator alters the amount of film granulation and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">"because the filter mixes color channels for reproducing infrared film, especially the green channel it does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, as the color information is missing."</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filet applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">"the & digitized; Filters filter granulation is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film granulation on your pictures. this is known by classical high-speed films, such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films the manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emulsion."</seg>
<seg id="596">"the screening effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere released from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, street-photographic, grainy view especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter."</seg>
<seg id="597">"with the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you need even more grain, you can apply the filter several times."</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film granulation effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digitized; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses an copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digitized; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">"the upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush is better for large images. flatten the smoothie or, from the other side, the sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the machining is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoothed 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">"the & digitized; Filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a carbon sketch. therefore, the lines that outline the outline in drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch. this would be good pictures to start."</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knobs with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be improved further by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digitized; filter engraver shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">"& digitized; Filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, where color is not the most important in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, moneyed landscape."</seg>
<seg id="608">"the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting."</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Shaft blocks 1: divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave Blocks 2: analogue to the single wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Acting.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork using blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Down: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center. this simulates the vaguity of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurred the image by rotating the pixels around a focal point. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance Description: wipes the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to reside in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">"motion blur: blurred the image by horizontal motions of the pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographing camera."</seg>
<seg id="619">"this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle light."</seg>
<seg id="620">Schüttelemeyer: blurts the image by random shifting of pixels and thus simulates the unsharpened of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: finds the color pool in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Acting.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives it natural to your images a wet appearance. it uses an algorithm protected by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the picture it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eye changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">"you can choose with the & digibox; image processing a range of free from raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops."</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regentropfen filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">"if the photo has the wrong orientation, you can get it in the right direction by mirroring or turning it into the right orientation."</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo Bubbles is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you blow up a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom in an image when the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you find the missing information again or guess? the Cimg algorithm used here makes here a good work. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">"if a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose the transition size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is to be seen below."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool for blowing."</seg>
<seg id="633">"many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge an image. & digitized; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo Bubbles was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">"maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size."</seg>
<seg id="636">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it has to be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly to it. magnifying each image for photo can be saved as a text file, and then loaded again."</seg>
<seg id="638">"picture Bubbles is very fast with what it makes, but it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Acting."</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo blowing by enlarging a small color image on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification.</seg>
<seg id="640">"editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together an image. to cut a photo you simply need to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle as you move the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="641">"if you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be clipped by dragging on the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle create by simply dragging it with the left mouse button."</seg>
<seg id="642">"once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The state-of-the-art mapping button in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the Save or File Save files from the File menu to save the newly cut photo."</seg>
<seg id="643">"in the preview pane, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="644">"in the tool according to aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as portrait format or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and in the landscape format of the width is assigned."</seg>
<seg id="645">"the tool according to aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimetres, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio."</seg>
<seg id="646">"at the right end of the dialog, two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically."</seg>
<seg id="647">"at the bottom of the dialog you can set the range for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the selected ratio and orientation."</seg>
<seg id="648">"the tool according to the aspect ratio cuts its settings depending on orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you use the trimming tool next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation. the modified image measurements are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflect the trimmed picture and not the original image."</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the help guide allow you to hide help so that you can put your pictures together better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">"harmonic triangles are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-rule, harmonic triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into similarly harmonic triangles on the diagonals."</seg>
<seg id="651">"golden centre: the golden centre is a division divided into different natural growth patterns, such as spiral of a Nautilus shell or the petals of a sunflower. it emerges in all the possible things that we perceive as beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden pitch is the Irrationale Number 1.618033988... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks built in order to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number derives from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where each number is equal to the sum of their two preceding numbers. one composition which follows this rule is regarded as visually harmonious."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides more liquefied guides when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos. in comparison to third-party rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition guides the viewer's gaze down the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow in this way."</seg>
<seg id="656">"a further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the golden triangles are also derived from the golden spiral discussed above. their vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that, unlike the harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not uniform triangles."</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect of a dynamic symmetry called professional photographer. try to place your image focus on one of the focal points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise."</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal Flip and Vertical reflect options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the guides can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"when you make a photo, it's easy that you keep the camera upright or horizontal. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can fix this with & digitize; image processing and the tool free rotation."</seg>
<seg id="663">The values on this slider are specified in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider back to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. now adjust it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have rotated a picture you will find undesired triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function Transforming trimming from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to trim the image is the automatic cutting function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after the rotation. note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed by a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. preview is then automatically recomputed. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">"new Width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels."</seg>
<seg id="671">"new height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels."</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle at the top left: indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the upper right: indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective, the picture gets a little dirty. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after you have adjusted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners."</seg>
<seg id="678">"a horizontal shear for example will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram."</seg>
<seg id="679">"shears your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can switch horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed right from the preview pane."</seg>
<seg id="680">"you can now move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image."</seg>
<seg id="681">"after you have performed the shear, the picture is wiped out a bit. for a single shear this effect is mostly negligible, but two notes generating twice as much pollution and therefore you should avoid this."</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shear the picture has some triangular holes in the corners. a way to remove it is to cut the picture with transformers cut-out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">"& digitifs; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. therefore, the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries have been compiliated. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digi."</seg>

<seg id="844">"all images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slideshow. with this module, it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program."</seg>
<seg id="845">"you first need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG denaschau. after that, you can start creating the module using Tools MPEG Diashau."</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under Image Files in the Portfolio. there you can also change the pictures or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">"the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe."</seg>
<seg id="848">"in the next step you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value generates very sudden, a high contrast very smooth picture changes."</seg>
<seg id="849">"the background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should leave them black. you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the mpeg output file."</seg>
<seg id="850">"if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it is integrated into the movie. once you have adapted all settings to your wishes, you can start making a coffee with the button coding. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now take a coffee or enjoy the slideshow once you are back."</seg>
<seg id="851">"if a note appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the mjpegTools and ImageMagick packets via the settings button at the bottom."</seg>
<seg id="852">The print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g.: useful to improve you or print them directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">"with this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW files into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM."</seg>
<seg id="854">Conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw of Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: expect dcraw not to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">"first, select the raw file that should be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the Preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image."</seg>
<seg id="856">"you can now adjust the values in order to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether camera settings are to be used for white balance. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the picture later."</seg>
<seg id="857">"a four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information. if your camera is in RGB mode, the RGBG switches have no effect."</seg>
<seg id="858">"once you are happy with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes."</seg>
<seg id="859">"Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all the information in your image and uses the lossless LZW compression."</seg>
<seg id="860">"if you are planning to edit your pictures frequently or otherwise continue to use it, you should not choose the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is worsened. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Execute button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use it."</seg>
<seg id="863">"batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are safe, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings."</seg>
<seg id="864">"the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed."</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the convert convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">"this module can be used to rename all pictures of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album."</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package.</seg>
<seg id="868">"proportional (1 dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="869">"proportional (2 Dim.): resizing in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to adjust your image to the screen format."</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-portional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">"preparation: prepares the image for photographic print. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adapted accordingly."</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">"after you have started the module, the pictures window will be displayed with the images selected by you. you can add more images using a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview will appear on the right-hand side."</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and place them in order to add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">Use the Delete images to remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">"after you have selected all the images, you can open the new message window to your e-mail client with the OK button. you only have to add the addresses and the subject here."</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure not to send too many pictures at once. most email accounts have limitations on the size of emails to be sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the pictures. your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">"select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below."</seg>
<seg id="880">"if you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here."</seg>
<seg id="881">"after selecting comments in an attached file, the comments on the pictures will be added to a text file and sent to the mail."</seg>
<seg id="882">"PNG format from the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and don't want to change the photo quality. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format."</seg>
<seg id="883">"when you select JPEG in file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original exifdata will be added to the images to be sent."</seg>
<seg id="884">"when the process is finished, the window will not be automatically closed so that you can view the status messages in search of errors. however, your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end."</seg>
<seg id="885">"after starting the module Advanced Diashau, a window will appear with questions like you want to show your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album."</seg>
<seg id="886">"the OpenGL-transitions option in the presentation enables very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you need to have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slideshow will be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="887">The File Name option show that the filename of the images in the lower left corner will be displayed during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop. you can then manually cancel it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select the images displayed in a random order. so it is not the order of the pictures used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">"between the pictures, the temporal distance between the images can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect."</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select. randomly choose another effect between the images.</seg>
<seg id="892">"during slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on."</seg>

<seg id="922">"in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why they are not specifically addressed."</seg>
<seg id="923">"at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. thus, those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no longer download images which, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time that you have specified. so it can browse your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transmission time. if it wants to get a picture larger, it switches to a higher resolution."</seg>
<seg id="925">"in this settings area, set the different folders and the URL where your website is stored."</seg>

<seg id="941">"the last option of this page is maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the images in full size since the .kim file would be very big. here you can limit the size by saying that each picture should be at most 800 pixels high and wide."</seg>

<seg id="1042">"if an image is rendered with only one ray per pixel, various errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">"& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, images with this property look better."</seg>
<seg id="1044">"if you turn on anti-aliasing, computes and connects & Povray; more than a ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling gives the adjacent pixels. the second method is adaptive and adaptive because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray of pixel. if you adjust the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels with super-sampling, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 subpixels that are individually pursued and checked for further subdivisions. the maximum depth of recursion can be adjusted to the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is that generating noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you switch on ittering, change & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">"the last setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental characteristic of & Povray;, the diffuse light reflection. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property."</seg>

<seg id="1657">"each section may only appear once, except the keymap section that may appear as often as desired. however, the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below)."</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END define keymap "Name of Keymap..." END define keymap "Another keymap..." END define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">See that define is used to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an email so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not general MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section you will see how the patches of General MIDI can be mapped to your specific keyboard. the general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the sign string is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you cannot change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"if your keyboard for example does not support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127, it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here is meant with the term" "drum patch" "of the patch where each tone represents another percussionist instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how notes are mapped on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you must create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used primarily to map tones to the percussions channel. take a look at the keymaps provided.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchanging the first and the second channel, make this easy in CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the Keymap option, the keymap with the name name will be used for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case, always patch x will be used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio indicates, in which ratio pitch-Bender occurrences are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, it is converted using the formula n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file there are no decimal commas."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM features a keyboard that receives a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096 to play a tone higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards attempt to play two notes down to one octave higher. to find the correct value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid; around."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI-map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you will find this in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which tones are being played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a drop down list, where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button does not flash red, but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played sounds.</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the tempo LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"so if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics, you can slow down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc;. this allows the same MIDI file to perform on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I cannot force anyone, & kmid; to use. but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; that's because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's start page)"</seg>
<seg id="1686">"I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not want to add all the files individually."</seg>
<seg id="1687">"agree, that's why supports & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"previously, enable automatic Addition setting to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection."</seg>
<seg id="1689">"you can use the arrow key to the left of Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the standard speed, you can double click on the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & kde; I have a & konqueror; window with my MIDI-Folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I want to play a karaoke file) or if I want to play a karaoke file (if I want to play a karaoke file) just go to & konqueror; change the file and drag the desired file into the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">"if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, turn off the automatic add-on to the collection, and the new file will be added to the temporary collection."</seg>
<seg id="1692">"let's assume you have the MIDI files A.Mmid, B.mide and C.mid. First, you just want to play the first file. so, set the automatic addition to the collection and open A.Ther. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.mide and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">"these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! when I hear these songs or see the postcard, it animates me to continue programming."</seg>

<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most desirable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation to the scripting language or formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before starting your own documentation, you might be checking in & quantaplus; -Repository, if someone has done it for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to have an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"funcname # KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index top element = Your description for these documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 documentation section 1 = Section1.html Section 2 = Section1.html Sec2.1 = Sec2.htms.html = tag.html tag 3 = tag3.html"</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example you can see now in the & PHP; documentation:</seg>
<seg id="2062">"# KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Introduction,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntacx.html..."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that there are subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the shaft (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">"note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequentially, at the top of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!)."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"spaces influence nothing, but make sure & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resources to be replaced."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"for example, when writing a & PHP; script should display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by marking the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"a simple list of separate context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;)."</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can simply save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (like you specified it in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"with & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the failing resources (DTEP packages, toolbar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"the resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. in different places there is an email sending menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, send tool bar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"the resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions are checked and only made available if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication. in order to make a donation, the source of resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the later users."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"when uploading, you will be asked for their passphrase for their private gpg key (the passphrase will not be saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the dialog New resource you need to pass the input fields (URL preview can be empty) and with clicking OK the upload will be started."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbar toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and Scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"after downloading a resource, before installing, investigates & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signature. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource."</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; it can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in any day XML format. there is the simpler way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD loading and converting an DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">"doctype definition line: the string, which should appear in the! Doctype tag, like HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd"</seg>
<seg id="2080">"fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when enabled, & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option."</seg>
<seg id="2081">"in order to understand this and to get full benefits from & quantaplus, you must first acquaint yourself with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to bring these concepts to them without their understanding and quantaplus."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"in & quantaplus, the workspace is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are for everyone, the & quantaplus; uses, available. from tool rails over promotions, everything that is marked as globally, is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to backup different tool rails, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. why so & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there were no references to the places where only the indentation had changed. the merging of these changes was a little nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences in a line and changes in white marks. later a lot of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-featured file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful when two persons work independently of one piece of code and make changes. in this editor you can edit the result even directly. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and reflects the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often have to check code, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more annoying when somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by writing only the filename of the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diffuse Folder 1 Folder 2 kdiff3 Folder 1 Folder 2 -o Destination folder kdiff3 Folder 1 Folder 2 folder 3 kdiff3 Folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 -o destination folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">"open dialog allows you to manually typing filenames, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"by clicking the folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons and merge of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for B and C, however, a folder, then uses & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"if merged, the input field is active for target and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to immediately set an output file. you can do this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"which thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains, for example, several similar features. if you want to find out how similar these features are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would need to create two corresponding files, they in & kdiff3; upload and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"note: at present, you can do nothing out & kdiff3; pull out. only the dropping of text into a comparison window is supported."</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret dragging and dropping text into another program than cutting and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"the info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and line number of the first visible row in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each Info row has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse get a while over the line.) then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)"</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)"</seg>
<seg id="2305">"when a difference is recognized, one can see the color that differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files. this is in the next section (merging) well."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"when differences are found, the color displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few rare cases.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line that separates the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line break is activated, the line is dotted with fractional lines."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the result window (under the comparison window) also has an info row with the wording output:, the filename and [changes] when you have edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts."</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved the Save is downlighted!!! (use the buttons jump to next solved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">"if only two comparative windows are used, each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed.) This group will then highlight the current group. it will be highlighted with the color background color for current pane, and each on the left will appear a black beam."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"sometimes by automatic merging or by manual editing, no more row is left in the group; then in these lines the text & lt; no row in the source file; this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you might copy and elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflicts; appears however in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">"note: when selecting the sources, ignoring the options or ignoring Ignoriere C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side up, start, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl end, Siw like you are used by other programs."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"in the menu window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the Add button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)"</seg>
<seg id="2317">"by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns, the view of all windows will be synchronized to the beginning of each group (as described in the merge section and the editable output window)."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Strg picture downwards) or to the next / previous unsolved conflict. therefore, the conflict between resolved and unresolved conflicts must be distinguished."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"to copy the mark to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). however, this option is automatically copied to the clipboard and removes manual copying. be careful with this option, as you may accidentally override the contents of the clipboard."</seg>
<seg id="2320">"line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix variants use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use a newline + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 retains the line-ends of the source files, therefore you should also not use binaries."</seg>

<seg id="2322">"select a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)"</seg>
<seg id="2323">"when you enable this option, differences are displayed in italics. if the chosen typeface does not support this display, nothing happens."</seg>
<seg id="2324">"in systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors might not be available in their pure form but would be illustrated. on these systems, the Preferences button automatically creates an unjust color."</seg>
<seg id="2325">"if this option is enabled, the number of spaces is inserted by pressing the tabulator button. otherwise, a tabulator character will be inserted."</seg>

<seg id="2329">"when comparing files, & kdiff3; first, to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white marks are ignored. in this step, white characters are ignored."</seg>
<seg id="2330">"some editors (on some systems) save a car return mark '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of a line, others only save a newline '\'. if this option is checked, the cart will be disabled, but this option has to be disabled."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"in default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"in default, this option is disabled. changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"the option is activated in default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow with very large files."</seg>
<seg id="2334">"in auto-jump mode, this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue."</seg>
<seg id="2335">"this is useful when white characters are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time, then use the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu."</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter on scanning of folders and performing a merge. see for details under documentation on the directory comparison and merging.</seg>
<seg id="2337">"if a file is saved and already an older version exists, then the original version will be appended with the suffix .original. if already such a backup file with the suffix .ORG exists, it will be deleted without further backup."</seg>
<seg id="2338">"change the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you must & kdiff3; stop and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set global over the control center.)"</seg>
<seg id="2339">"the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries."</seg>

<seg id="2341">"adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"if you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding for saving is to be used."</seg>
<seg id="2343">"if you define pre-processing commands, you might not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of preprocessors."</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch this to suppress upliftment of changes in white characters in the text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ignoriere C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">"this selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences between two of three files will be displayed. but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; -GT; C or B & lt; C or B & lt; -GT; C will be displayed next to the normal view column with the required information."</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. just leave the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes view the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files. current file merge in the merge menu also works if you only use two files. (if this function is used to restart the merge operation then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">"when reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3, the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your needs. you can use this function, for example, to cut out disruptive parts or to correct the indentation."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"when reading a file, it is passed first to this external command. if there is also a normal pre-processing command (see above), then the output of the command is used only with line comparison. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the Diff results. however, an external program is needed and most users don't want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient."</seg>

<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it's good as an example for a further processing command for newline comparison. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit and any hits will be replaced by nothing so virtually erased.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from one another. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">"instead of sed you can also use something else such as perl -p -e's / regexp / replacement / SCHALTER 'However, perl needs some details. where sed\\ (and\\) needed, perl needs only (and) without the preceding'\\ '. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for the display and to merge. the subsequent operations only change the data that the newline algorythm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor the newline preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data."</seg>

<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files for the format of Syslog server and for samba</seg>

<seg id="2946">"as you see in the following screenshots, & ksystemlog; functions are available with which the individual protocol rows of a protocol file can easily filter and sort. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start, & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - will not show you, and it opens up rather than a small message window, so you have not started with system administrators. the protocol files usually do not have permission to read in the folder / var / log, for the normal user."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter strip to filter after a selected criteria or set string. the list of the log lines is now automatically displayed, so that only log lines will be displayed next to the filter. then a log line will only be displayed when the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns."</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. the string of the Filter search term is then only offset with the entries in the corresponding column. for example in the log file system log the name of a process shows you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the key protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more noticeable color as protocol lines of level hint. the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you would like to show only a particular process (e.g. in the system protocol or in the cron protocol), you can see the process identification (PID) in the process. for example, this may be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command, such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter strip."</seg>

<seg id="2956">"welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and also named as & ksysv). this section introduces some concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init is rapidly becoming the standard for control of program start-up when running the system in the & Linux; world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go down here on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to install a machine on System V Init without a reinstallation and reformatting. that's why you must make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services do not contain such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls are to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks at different places after the program init and starts the first to find it.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default RunLevel 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have confused some, then you will fix it by restarting the system and executing the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that in this folder there are no right files. instead, each entry is linked to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: any of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument as start and stop. you can actually run these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server runlevel that only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc; running. furthermore, I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc; starts."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; using a mouse or other hand tool is simple to not say trivial: just drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start (or stop it) on this level.</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move between run-level scripts or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else. this will only be removed from its original runlevel (or its position). this will only happen if you remove an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries will be moved when you move them to a new level. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly choose copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and add them to the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sort number of an entry can sometimes not be computed. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the items you want before you try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator button to activate the different working areas (available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of above or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to manually change the sort number or the name of an entry, press the input button to change the properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"due to the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before executing."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be recovered by & ksysv; otherwise they will be saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard runways, and now the machine starts anew. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">"on the LILO, prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under run level X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions."</seg>
