&quot; although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is exceptionally great .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and practi@@ sed his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound impact on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Brief , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , revealed the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil mag@@ n@@ ate who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were inclined to be interested . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; I was as if it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA was only intensi@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had a very s@@ warming loving letter written about its size .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me as he goes about with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never thinks of the mountain as you say so nicely .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague expresses it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and tuned in dro@@ ves for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number ever reaching a nomin@@ ee by the party . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , which takes people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; also , tr@@ umps of world@@ view did not coinci@@ de with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours watching the &quot; Phoenix Suns &quot; at the game .
&quot; m@@ umps In@@ tolerance also contra@@ di@@ cts the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who strug@@ gl@@ ed with the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; it still fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with lots of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew le@@ ak@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , who helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump was running his way to the nom@@ inate Republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a hold and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America . &quot;
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
&quot; on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they either shared his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , I almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tr@@ ump voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; to order the people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , have voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can barely forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ its the cruel decision to lift a man looking down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( note d . ) : as much as &quot; &quot; c@@ asser@@ tion of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; ; word play from white in all@@ usion to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means the great Van Jones , has killed exactly what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have , America is welcome everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; but with the choice of Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to Hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; at a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
the crowd replied with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; ro@@ ared the crowd . &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried out , and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son was pleased , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; it is now a m@@ umps country , &quot; &quot; said the message . &quot;
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

out of the misery to the stars : these Latin American children don &apos;t let their love for music be destroyed by rub@@ b@@ ish

what has the Mexican Music School of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in O@@ ax@@ aca province common to the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an town of Cat@@ entur@@ a ?
&quot; the music played at both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the rub@@ b@@ ish
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years now , the La b@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the resulting poverty with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero &apos;s church in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and the gangs of gangs . &quot;
but this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare hope for hope .
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the gu@@ zz you learn day by day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pani , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
&quot; more than 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of Cat@@ entur@@ a - a village located at the top of the biggest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments manufactured from recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ manufactured instruments , made up of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ entur@@ a , where the Recycl@@ er under the direction of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez began to convert pieces of waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate gh@@ ost@@ s , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , saxoph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all made out of the gar@@ bage . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music and music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician teacher of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , rec@@ alls the beginning time : &quot;
&quot; first , it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in gar@@ bage . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children . &quot;
that changed when Fa@@ vio was shown something he had never seen before : a converted violin made of waste .
today there is an entire orchestra that plays instruments from re@@ manufactured material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; records the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like humans in Cat@@ entur@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring scenery from gar@@ bage to music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully combat illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practiced solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re @-@ release occurs as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the Liber@@ ian waters before it sought the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly up@@ set and little inclined to welcome a law break@@ er of this species to its coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were swi@@ f@@ tly mobili@@ zing against the ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all of a sudden , the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply refused , &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading cler@@ k of the Ken@@ yan F@@ ish@@ eries Administration . he is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship at that time . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of the pl@@ under@@ ing of the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , in 2012 , founded by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fisher@@ y ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that were exp@@ elled from their waters at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand up to each other where illegal fishing is concerned , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught will be hidden , so it is extremely difficult to trace why illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing from regions . &quot;
&quot; by deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate equilibrium . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once hin@@ dered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the s@@ nail emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions are now in real @-@ time , trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange listings of existing licenses , news about suspic@@ ious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i also closely monitors the activities of ships when they move on the open sea , via satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships which fish in forbidden areas . also , suspic@@ ious driving routes can be discovered - such as those suggest@@ ing that a ship charges its caught fish on the road to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fish fan@@ ci@@ ence where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal spirit . &quot;
&quot; countries which are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their har@@ bours , meaning that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced into the numbers of pun@@ ish@@ ments , as in the case of the Premier . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a considerable financial loss for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consultant company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the previously mentioned platform was created to win an estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover , which will lose the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year because of the illegal fisher@@ man who inv@@ ade East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries that attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also equally illegal fisher@@ man .
&quot; their practices include like sailing under false flag , fake license papers , indication of fan@@ ta@@ sies , fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the missing international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ volati@@ le organized control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &apos; You don &apos;t attack my harbour &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot;
&quot; until now , the closed front operates . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspic@@ ious ships . &quot;
it has un@@ covered criminal networks that had distributed forged licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships which used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has persec@@ uted and found escap@@ ing ships .
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for comb@@ ating crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and receive information on illegal fishing over long distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to pin@@ point suspic@@ ious ships .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track the illegal ships that love to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fisher@@ man uses very sophisticated techniques to conc@@ eal their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg Mat Tracking , an NGO , which also deals with fisher@@ y data and offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be detected by satellites . &quot;
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping build a system that connects different levels of information . F@@ ISH @-@ i will help to find criminal acting ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team can actually influence African nations on the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the NR@@ O Sky@@ Truth , believes this . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing World@@ watch platform together with Google and the Oc@@ e@@ ana marine conservation organisation : a platform that provides satellite data and can display the position of each single tra@@ ck@@ able ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing what is doing , it simply makes sense , &quot; he says . &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources . &quot;
&quot; we should do so on a global scale . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project in which a global system permits prosecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect crimin@@ als , but also deter them . &quot;
ships which used to be f@@ ished without a licence and hardly anticipated with consequences now know that they are being watched .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i meanwhile have a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries turnover , since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board Schle@@ pp@@ netz@@ e , whose use is banned . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; there were six countries united in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they too are fighting illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; with security the aim is to let even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to announce its first major triumph : in October , it represented Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag . and not only the ship was on the road without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets that are banned by now . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded in forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working in the entire world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TE@@ D Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of returning the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the Venezu@@ el@@ as government rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on the removal of a referendum , Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the country &apos;s political and economic crisis ran into empt@@ iness by hanging on the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the re @-@ order of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found . &quot;
&quot; the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the low@@ land region of Bar@@ inas , in the coastal regions of Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central north @-@ north of the federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country continues to deterior@@ ate , which makes itself felt in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many of the opposition representatives saw in the removal of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , the chance for a fundamental change ; in the end , however , the de@@ position of a new election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ ors to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in their latest article the context of government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum needed to give the country the chance of rec@@ ap@@ it@@ ating its institutional structures and closing a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( for example : round table of the Democratic Unit ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces . in addition , a 12 @-@ hour strike on the Fol@@ lowing Day and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government headquarters , planned on 3 November , should continue to pers@@ ist in the blocking of the referendum . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
&quot; it is so far Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration in the frame of the Action Programme &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most commonly divided pictures shows a prot@@ esters calling through the protective shield : &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot;
&quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; this Venezu@@ el@@ ans cry . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , images that tell of disputes , as well as reports of oppression and abuse . &quot;
especially large waves hit the news about police repression in the central @-@ north of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators with@@ drew back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed supporters of the government .
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators attempted to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic already accounts for the level of oppression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a ten@@ dering procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of inn@@ um@@ erable people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the sig@@ natures are fake .
here is your removal !
on the road !
&quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which has little against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and preferred to keep critical voices sil@@ enced : &quot;
you have taken us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always take more in frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media they were too hungry to participate in a strike , rather than working or shopping . &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview written by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 in D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian news site . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and will be published with kind permission here .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to witness the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Córdoba . &quot;
Qui@@ j@@ ano now grown up in the province of Córdoba as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Córdoba .
&quot; in the trial concluded on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were examined . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept the family secrets for himself .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I believed that was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret mag@@ ician .
&quot; as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turers and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the secret service division 141 in La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

&quot; this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pres@@ sor who was accused of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kid@@ n@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ ñ@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had seen as a boy , and who testi@@ fied against his own father in front of a federal court . &quot;
his story shows what great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose for himself a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . &quot;
everybody knew him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you made yourself friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
pass merely that they will not dec@@ eive you one day and I must save you .
&quot; the ac@@ ron@@ ym ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party in Argentina . &quot;
that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work at the military base .
he told me I would become en@@ vy .
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok , because so my father had raised me . &quot;
&quot; at the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoner . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda materials , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ cause the prisoners are tor@@ tured . &apos;
my father took me four times after La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get out . he took me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen objects were placed and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I rolled in , and saw a couch , on which men were tor@@ tured . &quot;
she looked like a cot and metal springs .
later I found out that they fast@@ ened one end of a cable to it . the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just been tied there .
&quot; they tied up a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased him 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the st@@ ench there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty wind .
&quot; years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell right away and it became clear to me that it is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ?
I knew that these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he took me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were wearing glasses . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men lay down with the face down - all were tied in hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; near the entrance , people kept quiet on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you do , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
I replied &quot; Why did you otherwise bring me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man and killed .
&quot; ( according to data from survivors the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , accused the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio F@@ essi@@ a , the head of the memorial La Per@@ la , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came here is also the way on which the kid@@ n@@ apped came here .
&quot; if you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be laid . &quot;
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their dead bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War Gra@@ ils &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
&quot; at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war yield &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was in the military myself , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war was a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military emblem , which one takes to an enemy that one has fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , the turn@@ table , clothes , paintings , money ... there is no war yield but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never be able to enter into a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I replied , &quot; &quot; You , who are driving cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded against anger , struck me and cried out : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill yourself . &quot;
&quot; to do this , we don &apos;t need anyone else ! &quot;
so was my father .
I have not a single good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a roll @-@ out pul@@ lover made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothing home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense , a co @-@ con@@ j@@ er accused me of being at this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay my burden on what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to testify .
&apos;@@ The dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , when I get older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , so you have executed people during the dictatorship . but why do the bodies disappear ? &quot;
why children kid@@ n@@ apped ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with her , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it would have been easy to put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it has just been decided to kill these people , but why do their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did these people not have families that could be handed over to their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act you can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to remove the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; said my Father . &quot;
but of course there is always something left .
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
&quot; the thought of showing my Father arose during a conversation , when he stood under house arrest . &quot;
I made him repro@@ aches for all the cru@@ el@@ ties that I had to experience because of him .
then he suddenly said : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have compelled me as a child to participate .
&quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; Then let me show me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
2010 I ref@@ unded the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can blame me for being bi@@ ased . I have finally said to my own father .
&quot; Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 , under house arrest , before the end of the trial . &quot;
&quot; charged with 4@@ 16 crimes , including heavy , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , torture in 98 cases of particularly severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kid@@ n@@ apping of a child under 10 years old . &quot;

&quot; jud@@ gements in the &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot;
the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers in the Spanish to the magnitude of the judgment .
&quot; after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 Supp@@ res@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the court was sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of the 54 def@@ end@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ Form : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ war@@ stat@@ ec@@ ror@@ ism &quot;
&quot; all def@@ end@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees . &quot;
&quot; Pier@@ o De Monti , together with his pregnant wife , was kid@@ n@@ apped in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la . &quot;
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations that have worked for years for justice for the victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the Adv@@ oc@@ ate of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people murdered during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the process took more than three years , but research lasted 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be erected there , which is now led by human rights organisations . &quot;

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; aw@@ ful drivers &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend your driver &apos;s license . &quot;

edited by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend its driving license , in the last month , witnesses of a very ab@@ used translation . &quot;
&quot; on a shield , the Japanese word &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; signi@@ fies , wron@@ g@@ ly - but perhaps also with mal@@ icious mind@@ set and # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; terrible drivers &quot; translated . &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building from 1 to 20 September .
&quot; editing the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in social media . &quot;
&quot; the fault was noticed by Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the daily Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n daily written in Kyoto :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and an international city such as Kyoto is simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , though gram@@ m@@ atically not quite correct designation &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text that she had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt insul@@ ted by the insufficient correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; said the police . &quot;
&quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News dealt with a little more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; elderly drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older drivers , who are involved in accidents across the country , is certainly a cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a proportion of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of total 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; thus , their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the repor@@ ter named in particular brought comments to light in the article published on Yahoo , which show which preju@@ di@@ ces some Japanese are apparently resting against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo for translation errors , among other things , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; is that ( &quot; &quot; terrible car &quot; &quot; ) for example not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; So the translation is not really bad , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that this is a real translation error .
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in all of Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; for translation , one needs two important abilities : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the source language - native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from the French into English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers wishing to learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who do not have foreign employees themselves , can make translations still in @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
the confused and pu@@ zz@@ ling pro@@ positions created by machine translation show that this technique cannot replace any human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages very special .
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic prints , which often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be still acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry , but by large companies or government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on internet and television
&quot; main page of the &quot; &quot; Nav@@ eed con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; &quot; portal ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the Internet sites of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online transm@@ itters were also transmitt@@ ing recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups , resist@@ ing Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros &apos;s government . &quot;
&quot; the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and entrusted the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was capped and recommended to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet . &quot;
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activate your VPN .
it seems that web pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an Provider are again locked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been rel@@ uc@@ tant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closing arguments if they continue to report about the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I filed myself with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible through a locking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two more online transm@@ itters . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions . &quot;
&quot; earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS server answer queries of certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a web page is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds er@@ ron@@ eous or ref@@ uses the request to call such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; in V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , the transmission was stopped on Thursday , 6th April , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who held the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custo@@ dy .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections : thus the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country ever more difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls are becoming slaves to receive education &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina fights for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies of other crimes , just as victims were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the shor@@ tened version of a brief report published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que CA@@ EN &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , deca@@ ying schools &quot; ) edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before gradu@@ ating at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house proudly spoke about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; the one who has become something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old she began working as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ lla , in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money passes their min@@ ors son or their minor daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , an education and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to afford countless days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that one cannot raise . &quot;
&quot; the practice described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay , due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organisation that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she talked with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated through the Cri@@ adi@@ tas is generally still silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double illusion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who is their daughter in the belief that they will complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who assi@@ mil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies her exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no scho@@ oling , and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will experience it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín entered the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of intense blows . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military @-@ member Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife , Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants situated 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra struck Mar@@ ín as long as they suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UNI@@ CE@@ F or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela formed the cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they designated Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest letters and demanded that there should be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; more cows are registered in Paraguay than children , &quot; &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbors of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded a rapid investigation of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl , who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; if the case is in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín might be pointing out - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go could come to court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live in isolation from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the El@@ vis , where her father worked , had to register bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his job . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to work all the way , and began to sell swe@@ ets on the street or on the market to make money . &quot;
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
&quot; in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that you still have time to learn . &quot;
she rose up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employers .
&quot; for example , she clean@@ sed the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school ended , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the sooner she was done with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but did not have an unlimited meal . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the host as food from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some evenings , the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand alongside him and read editorial articles such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them to believe in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; he held them intellig@@ ently , but did not keep up with her . &quot; the host had found someone who listened to while he talked about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; there again . so they thought that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would speak at home again their mother tongue guar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
&quot; their Lord was afraid that she would lose the education she had made possible , she explains . &quot;

the Society appro@@ ves Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and pa@@ edi@@ atric girls in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administrative cur@@ ator of the group is P@@ epa Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city counc@@ ill@@ or in As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please sign up .
starting from Monday if possible .
&quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; likes &quot; &quot; and a lot of comments . &quot;
a woman from the town Ñ@@ u@@ by wrote that she would have a year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ u@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
in the third commentary it was written by &quot; a girl from the country inner who wants to work . &quot;
then the authors of the ad switched off once again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I look if it works with it . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again when something is . &quot;
the business was completed .
&quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue for the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of witnesses of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history we managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , where the Spanish con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of the Guar@@ an@@ í ( where the Spanish Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores got paid tribute to them ) and the Spanish conquest , where they are becoming a system of slavery , in which they become light victims for abuse and exploitation . &quot;
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill prescri@@ bes Egypt &apos;s social media users to register with the government

sixty @-@ five Egyptian MPs backed a draft law on &quot; the regulations regarding use and benefits of social networks . &quot;
&quot; when adopted by Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be established that is entrusted to citizens to use a permit to educ@@ ate social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with acceptance of the law , users must register on the site of the site with their correct names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine . &quot;
&quot; the bill which consists of six parag@@ raph@@ s and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video , and text . &quot;
&quot; it is uncle@@ ar how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how the Egyptian authorities should make the registration . uncle@@ ar is also how they should account those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and supporters of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users who received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to block Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook , because of which it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it has not yet been known that such plans exist .
experts on site are skep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leading research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights , &quot; said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they pret@@ end that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces it could be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , that means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who require a permit or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to lead them to a court process . &quot;
&quot; this is technically not realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to be passed as a law , the draft must first be discussed with the Parliament &apos;s legisl@@ ature and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its adoption and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose interests the control is maxim@@ ized and will be ensured that no different nar@@ ration is present on the image area , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Member of Parliament Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed legislation against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence for those destined to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; urge &quot; protest . &quot;

&quot; high up in the Kur@@ dist@@ an Mountains in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal conserv@@ ator H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of the Leop@@ ards , which w@@ anders through Africa and Asia , belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , they are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of po@@ aching , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat . &quot;
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; how Raz@@ a shows in the video &quot; &quot; is the Persian Leopard the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem depends on the fact that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild wild is low and goes against zero . when the video shows that they have a picture of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passi@@ on@@ ately displays a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies for wildlife and educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years .

&quot; documented in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ p@@ o , responsible for North East Japan , the progress achieved over the past six years to re@@ build the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; in March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had triggered the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring pris@@ ons Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to ev@@ acu@@ ate because the ts@@ un@@ ami had all coastal cities disappear from the map .
&quot; the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture has still suffered a nuclear accident , already alone for this reason that 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows , from a local point of view , what progress has been achieved six years later in order to re@@ build the lives of local residents . &quot;
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics from the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those affected themselves .
&quot; the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such homes , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma produces 70 percent of the rear light . &quot;
&quot; however , even six years after the catastrophe , Ev@@ acu@@ ated von Beh@@ el &apos;s lod@@ gings ( their own , kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) are still trying to reloc@@ ate to final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the thre@@ e@@ fold catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in homes . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate in such homes . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 percent of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma ev@@ acu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated ones who were hau@@ led after the disaster in homes were res@@ ett@@ led to final houses . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures concerned
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to investigate , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune were re@@ opened until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 percent of the fisher@@ y ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of fishing har@@ bours have res@@ um@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident occurred in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear pl@@ ywood . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far off . &quot;
&quot; the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the accident . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to obtain an overall picture , the newspaper led numerous surveys among the native population and under the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
in her introduction to the article K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the native population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents had taken measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
how it stands for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its issue for the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also reinforced its attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma not only had to witness the massive earthquake and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear incident that Japan had ever had . &quot;
&quot; nearly 63 000 people were displac@@ ed in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23@@ ,000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent sub@@ stitutes . &quot;
&quot; according to the 2017 , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ acu@@ ees , who still live in homes , are older than 50 years old . they have to come back in proper hab@@ itation because the efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people come across from other countries speaking another language , the differences seem to be greater than what is common . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our preju@@ di@@ ces , expand our perspective and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we deal with topics that often get less attention than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected to someone over speech and country borders .

&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit . last Friday , a police officer killed him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a strike against the head . nationwide millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors took him on this Saturday and now put him in an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil in a few days . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures , the face of the police officer came to know who attacked with a strike . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian federal state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended from active service until the end of the investigation . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he hits in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on TV for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video taken by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the web where you can see how Mat@@ eus attacked by the police officer and several plum@@ bers rus@@ hed to it shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video filmed with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus starting from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital . &quot;

police Gri@@ ps
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where last Friday there was a brutal police action against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; polic@@ emen were at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators built a stage for speakers , rubber floor and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to reno@@ unce violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , Brazilian media have sli@@ pped road protests by focusing on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a wind@@ screen . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were systematically reported on a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively shape their titles with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o fav@@ ored a cover story with a brand set alight . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible , journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window as about the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing . &quot;
this must also be recognized if one is strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is an absurd , disp@@ ro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical atro@@ cities of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confron@@ tations with the police . &quot; &quot;
the Un@@ ch@@ aired Villa@@ ges in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in the whole of Cuba closed doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , who is located in the Western Cub@@ an province of May@@ ab@@ que , is widely known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill regardless of the fact that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest locally . &quot;
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories have been la@@ under@@ ed .
&quot; after the rest , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sm@@ ells of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ ute daily to the factories which still ex@@ h@@ ort .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region there are sugar cane mol@@ dings , which are in operation after a long in@@ active period of time , because they were obtained . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene rec@@ alls exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry resist@@ ed already the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a motive for the country for some decades , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer news anymore . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway station of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity . 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and they became unbe@@ atable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the global market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 published report of the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organisation . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the present day will certainly enter history , &quot; that was the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the stagn@@ ation of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full sal@@ aries for further education . &quot;
the same happened at the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as known as a soldier , speaks about the closing of the factory , the word he repeated most is &quot; betra@@ yal . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents were in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first leg , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; these were officially written documents , which were only distinguished with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , responsibility was taken over and the letters were getting more and more frequent . &quot;
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane brand@@ y factories in operation . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved against his will at the shut@@ down of the factory , in which he helped build it . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important working group has been eradic@@ ated .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives were created for the employment and performance of the facilities in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president saw in the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane brand@@ y factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is only extracted highly by grinding . &quot;
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich became acquainted with many things , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to dis@@ car@@ ve it , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms too . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they were made to spare parts .
&quot; without a future perspective , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created whose production does not even serve the care of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he started working . &quot;
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a rent of two thousand p@@ eso per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a suppor@@ tive person , yet he for@@ gives the lies he told him not . &quot;

first Nations young people use hip hop to express themselves and get their own culture

young people of the First Nations communities throughout Canada are concerned with topics that are important to them . they do it through hip @-@ hop thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour since 2014 , workshop leaders will bring mobile studios directly to schools and youth centers to teach song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David H@@ od@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop refers to the fact that the young participants in conversations contain topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , engagement , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes into mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the territory of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ cal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; a road section in West Canada , where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were van@@ ished or murdered . &quot;
the cases were mostly not elu@@ ci@@ dated .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of maintaining traditional customs and customs despite the influences of glob@@ alisation .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always master the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ Mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us will be sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ star Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a verse in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me
but I try to continue my days on earth
that is the day when you will take our cry .
because we as a youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and as well as our youth go ahead
so they can do what they intended for the Creator
&quot; in the comment section , the reader and advoc@@ ate of Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a contribution and adds the verse to sy@@ ll@@ amas ( which is published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;
&quot; plastic dishes ( &quot; &quot; more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caps &quot; &quot; ) outside of a typical Japanese restaurant . &quot;

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , will be exhibited in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; &quot; ) of any food that is served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers are watching these plastic dishes and then decide if they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ a , there are a variety of small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so usually that they do not even notice them . however , a new trend is now turned into show@@ y mobile phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blog writer it@@ ini@@ i published several social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin dé@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in special sale : new with plastic straps decorated cell @-@ rib@@ bons , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y coll@@ ecti@@ bles , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin refrigerator mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the essenti@@ als becomes increasingly more complex .
in this case an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a cell phone .
we also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your cell phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
&quot; some mobile stands and mobile designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now can I decorate my mobile phone with salmon ? . &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic bags can also take a less appe@@ tizing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also pad@@ dies ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; further sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # , more than ben@@ zene has a lot of tas@@ kbar shopping . &quot;
&quot; if you like to know more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ a that is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; struggle against drug traff@@ icking &quot; in Mexico , the ver@@ sts and those killed regularly only show up in statistics . however , these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings with it . &quot;
&quot; the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely squee@@ zed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or on the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each cor@@ p@@ se , behind every bone finding in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; Apr@@ tiv@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; live with drug traff@@ icking &quot; ) , which is to give this victim a voice and tell stories of people who fell in the battle between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organized crime cannot only be feared for our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for instance , when shops close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore whole communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
pain of the victims
a video called &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on a single day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; like every Sunday , we are also preparing ourselves today for the task we have set ourselves to go and search for gra@@ ves , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta said : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me because I am now alone with three children who need education . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is with me here too . &quot;
at the moment they have no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but she does not pay them out because they require a dying certificate . &quot;
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it appears : &quot;
I have known illness and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for several years now .
I pass every day to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with images that can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person that once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traff@@ icker ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people listen to songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is as if they mo@@ urn the ones who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become blo@@ ated numbers in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; the in@@ genu@@ ity of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of 43 students in an adjacent ort would be justified , that they were &quot; &quot; poss@@ essions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to say that they will be spar@@ ed of such trage@@ dies , if they do not stir and remain silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the capital district : &quot; as a family with threats has been pl@@ under@@ ed , &quot; she describes how armed crimin@@ als were pressed for month money from their business until they did not only destroy the business but also broke their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can change your whole life completely in just a few days .
&quot; the pain of this never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes back high once you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers also . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the more we are apart from each other , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because they don &apos;t know when they will dec@@ eive you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; in these terrible days I wonder@@ ed if we@@ eping would dis@@ solve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he says he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and that he had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood had been over two years before , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , saw bloody cor@@ p@@ ses of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of kill@@ ings according to the Public Security Council and the Government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
in 2010 alone the public prosec@@ utor called 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories still live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the &quot; Apr@@ tiv@@ a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; project , Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand words
sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strö@@ ms ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and pages that he links contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how about the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false copy of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News , does not den@@ ies the fact that there is abundant careful reporting of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , dump@@ ed and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected and devast@@ ated for years . the streets in the region became dangerous paths filled with pot@@ holes , which were difficult to navigate . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , he fell victim to the tank car . &quot;
&quot; officials representative described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ ops dozens of houses including a cinema nearby , full of people watching the football world championship . &quot;
houses pla@@ stered and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to be un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 . January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horri@@ ble scenes of that day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies lined up on the ground while people watch them .
but here history does not find its end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was recorded several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am grab@@ bed the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically from atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; no one stayed back to count bodies , &quot; said a inhabitants to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many had been sh@@ attered , shot or burned . &quot;
only by means of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be depicted .
&quot; the occasion for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo again when it was mistakenly presented as proof of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ usi@@ ve use of the DR DR image is only one in a series of false attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the image was presented as a receipt for mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one step further , personal comments such as this example wron@@ g@@ ly convey the image of the DR Congo with sources of mass media related to arguments . &quot;
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash announcement , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee could pun@@ ish pun@@ ches , rape and some dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported on the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following items appeared , describing these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture was taken from an Saudi @-@ Arab news site , which frank@@ ly claimed President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein have said that monks and politicians had participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from DR Congo to expose this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , who called AF@@ P as their source , had wron@@ g@@ ly attributed to Th@@ ein Sein this statement , but had not associated with the image of the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false ou@@ pling reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; with an inver@@ ted picture search , you can see how far information borders can cross . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search@@ engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the image of the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixed @-@ m@@ ash of private pages , social media platforms and common as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have passed false reports , some have attempted to expose the counter@@ fei@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; we have excluded examples of mis@@ use and linked them to the respective countries , based on what side they have been published . thus , we want to represent the reach clear@@ er than by language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( sometimes linked to each other ) , several examples can be used for impro@@ per use . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be completely ap@@ sed ( on the map in orange ) :

examples of false copy of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point out to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
&quot; the Gra@@ y countries are examples that are , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also for@@ gery examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( directed at Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a threads to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Germany , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this paper , a blo@@ gger from Quebec City comm@@ its not only the wrong message , but also discusses the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria and further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies in them ( in DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;
&quot; Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; &quot; Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los Cris@@ ti@@ an@@ os &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria they burn the Christians ) . &quot;
&quot; in this article on explo@@ sions in North @-@ Canada in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place . &quot;
La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica quotes as its source the Spanish News Agency EF@@ E ( although not known whether the original report contains the picture ) .
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions after the massac@@ res of B@@ oko Har@@ am , such as this one who used the image of the DR Congo to illustrate the atro@@ cities of Islam , clearly have no sides like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster to refu@@ te this . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the er@@ ron@@ eous use of the image since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , then promoted by a post by the American , anti @-@ Islamic comment@@ ator P@@ am@@ ela G@@ eller . &quot;

this statement was ref@@ uted by a Greek fact check page 2013 and once again in 2016 .
&quot; Iran , 2012 . &quot;
an association of the students of the@@ ology ( mul@@ la@@ hs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims about the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the image of the DR Congo .
&quot; Germany , 2015 . &quot;
an inhabit@@ ant of the old town P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o from Tr@@ ento posted this news on his side to express his solidarity with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre in Nigeria .
&quot; Nigeria , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; even within Nigeria , the photo taken from the DR Congo was shared as proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ usi@@ ve use of the image from DR Congo , on the one hand a twe@@ et , the sympathy for the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand , the attempt of a blo@@ gger to del@@ ine@@ ate claims , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , as the photos were mis@@ used . &quot;
Myanmar is 2017 .
&quot; the Myanmar government released a draft on what they came to as &quot; deliberately f@@ ing@@ ed news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings about Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this adjustment , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of sm@@ ells used by H@@ ate Speech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to suggest that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and elsewhere ( which is often widespread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , addressed to the members of the Orthodox Church , clearly states that the picture of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims who kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein Sein have admitted that monks and politicians were involved in killing the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained in it .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 about students who had been murdered by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the recently deleted message house An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture came into circulation later in the context of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the El Pa@@ is newspaper tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the image of the DR Congo di@@ pped with this t@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion among Muslims following the massac@@ res of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times saved ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison between Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message suppos@@ edly written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as this one here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false announcement . &quot;
&quot; from the message in which the picture was taken from the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et Mission@@ aries and Pater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; on other accounts , generators and pages in the following countries ( on the map in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and some have image file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all of these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the image may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and Images
there are two strong themes or frames that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the assass@@ inations of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued as compared to a European or French life .
understanding religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens if readers cannot believe this picture any longer . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who inten@@ tionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true , and the actual horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo , Nigeria and in Myanmar ? &quot;
the dis@@ semination of violent pictures has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
an argument is that the retention of images of a refusal occurs to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even asked by the victims themselves .
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that for@@ cible images des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take the ability to emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investig@@ ates how violent media seem to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is a fact that it is essential for today &apos;s news coverage . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experim@@ ented with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; fake News &quot; . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be extracted from the context or to completely mis@@ used species . &quot;
&quot; however , each examination of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ tran@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons used in accordance with CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog named Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( for example , irre@@ plac@@ eable ) endeav@@ ours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not at all to translate . &quot;
&quot; such words are in each language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist persistent every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a whole time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ tran@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Mus@@ cat you care for your parents in recognition of your efforts in your younger years .
&quot; words in the lyrics language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The la@@ z@@ iness or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel , after having been war@@ med up in the sun on cold days . &quot;
in Birds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
&quot; they un@@ veil other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of these &quot; insur@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treasure Langu@@ ages , &quot; highly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

&quot; like Sri Lanka , with the worst floo@@ ding disaster of the decade , &quot;
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and flood disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which is normally used at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya occurred over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; following an opinion of the disaster relief of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundred people are missed due to the floo@@ ds and slu@@ dges . &quot;
&quot; over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places of residence . &quot;
&quot; rain falls gradually on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly went back . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ds in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water st@@ alls of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the magnitude of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ds wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , war@@ ns Save the Children after further ra@@ inf@@ alls have already been on the way . &quot;
&quot; today the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations and another five are completed for the transport of emergency supplies to the inhabitants enclosed in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and start @-@ ups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about flood situations and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue team need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks for people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum will be informed .
&quot; last year after the catastrophe of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me led a &quot; flood relief &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle to collect assistance and donations . they were then forwarded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free . &quot;
they also introduced a &quot; SO@@ S &quot; button that resulted in more than one thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ds and land@@ slides .
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents into need and help remedi@@ al measures . &quot;
&quot; this prevented the loss of further human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;
the Muslims not to see
the Women &apos;s March will be held in San Francisco on 21 January 2017 .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; in January , I took part in Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and dear friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts me to her children ; she is my rock in the surf . &quot;
&quot; in the one minute , we still call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next few years , we will have rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some keep the icon@@ ographic picture of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , others are gu@@ essing slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girl@@ friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , right ? &quot; &quot; why , because I &apos;m not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already conducted this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who know me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - of the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
they ab@@ dic@@ ate me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims around the world .
we do not look all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , to different kinds . but somehow we are all stuck into the same Muslim basket . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is designed in our collective imagination so well that as soon as Muslims , as I do not want to clean up there , are to be removed . &quot;
being de@@ mus@@ li@@ zed
I &apos;m not alone .
this has even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images come in mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western conception the religion of Rum@@ is was er@@ ased , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ eting represents a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
&quot; another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims , who have been col@@ oni@@ alising Western books for centuries . &quot;
this temp@@ ting visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the landmark Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ car@@ ded the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images still stand out today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood keep on ver@@ ge them . &quot;
&quot; I worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , fla@@ wed fo@@ ols dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries over the last three decades , while the United States did not even vote for its first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this narrative fails to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their veil in public buildings and forcing Saudi Arabian , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group ex@@ erts its &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women who conduct movements for change .
&quot; it notices that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil of Afri@@ cans , which were brought here with slave ships . &quot;
it delet@@ es the existence of qu@@ eer @-@ Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative has occupied our collective imagination so deep and fla@@ wed , that often Sik@@ h men and children are to target an@@ tim@@ ul@@ ous attacks and attacks . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry is fail@@ ing to grasp the foo@@ lish of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims comprise the highest degrees of &quot; various &quot; religious groups in America . &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ speaking Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the first generation immigrants origin@@ ating from 77 countries .
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan was re @-@ imag@@ ining the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were far from Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now an irre@@ versible Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ shake that all Muslims wear with themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m jo@@ king , we do not carry all the peb@@ bles with us . &quot;
we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to combat widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for false information , which have already tam@@ pered with our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam hos@@ tility exists in more than just a foreig@@ ner who r@@ amp@@ eth the veil of a woman . &quot;
&quot; or as the frigh@@ tening map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the entire USA , see below . &quot;
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam hos@@ tility in its ug@@ ly forms acc@@ esses our belonging .
&quot; it attacks our identity which is so extensive , so versatile and complex that it cannot fit into a drawer . &quot;

use approved .
I would like to explain that .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born only then into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; if social scientists describe religious life , they respond to the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girl@@ friend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the br@@ anding that I am Muslim if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the ni@@ ghtly ritual with my daughter when I held her in my arms , and her Arab verses for protection , which seal the Koran and be called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the author &apos;s grand@@ mother , when she wins an icon competition in Kar@@ achi , pos@@ ing with her sisters some@@ time in the 1960s . &quot;
use approved .
&quot; belonging is the image of my mat@@ ernal grand@@ mother with her sisters , as they gain decades ago a competition of art of arran@@ ging flower arrangements in Kar@@ achi . &quot;
&quot; it is the image of her that I can see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi saints ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
being Muslim means speaking the prayers that she told me to speak when I have a bad day .
&quot; being Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people who - for centuries - have been colon@@ ised through an empire , which established a company named Ven@@ erable British Ost@@ erg@@ ate Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grand@@ father .
use approved .
&quot; belonging means growing up and hearing that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my grand@@ father we@@ eps . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an cri@@ es about his family in India ruled by K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he could not close into his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grand@@ father , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists , who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have been &quot; colon@@ ised &quot; up to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first bomb bomb of the story was dis@@ car@@ ded over a Muslim country in a century ago .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grand@@ father of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , ash@@ mere sig@@ tan of the British Empire , was described by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous , &quot; since he took the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; even before aircraft existed , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;
the word of Islam .

to belong to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ es ; our inv@@ inci@@ ble history .
&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops , distributed across the continent apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , have gone to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried beneath the ruins of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy is pun@@ ishing US and the susp@@ ect bears a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ ination . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave named Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means knowing that an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country two hundred years ago .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim ban .
it is the hope I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim , a Muslim , and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of ours with multiple d@@ ashes , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion contains more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reduced duality of &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and to all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals establish structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this sec@@ t@@ edness . &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim regi@@ str@@ ars that began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child into hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it consists in a country that sh@@ uts its borders to people from just the countries it bom@@ bed it .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which is largely Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs , which we reject in Muslim lands . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University students showed a scientifically accurate picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with respect to evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations we have to lead
we are too deeply advised to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; we have decades back to recognise the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous images we use in our news editors . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement led by US Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the pod@@ cast see Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to propag@@ ate Muslim writers , and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ KI@@ ST@@ AN@@ ISH , Muslim , American super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American lives .
col@@ lage of the author .
&quot; but I am concerned because of this difficult global point of time , in which we are . &quot;
and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason for conspiracy the@@ or@@ ists , who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House . &quot;
&quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally , because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a few years before , they had not yet given them ; they now dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history of which I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but that made me become an essential Muslim today . &quot;
things I have left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech .
&quot; things that may aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity makes , a story list@@ ens to where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations are held at the 8th Annual Conference on Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; American militar@@ ism &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but these are not words that we usually throw in our schools around us or read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why am I telling this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where was Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are fought and people are enth@@ used by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation , which was even scientific by Stan@@ ford four decades ago . &quot;
&quot; we must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being conscious and un@@ conscious of the &quot; other &quot; as it is my girl@@ friend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment we have no pres@@ idents who bom@@ bed the chocolate cake while he already enc@@ ap@@ sul@@ ated countries and &quot; other ge@@ aled &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .

&quot; stor@@ yt@@ elling story , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treasure User Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it . &quot;
&quot; recently , Global Vo@@ ices reported about another initiative by Steven Bird , the insur@@ moun@@ table blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the diversity of languages of big cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; the mass death of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces , in which inhabitants don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to . &quot;
&quot; while listening often to understand &quot; &quot; these events instead , &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; listen , &quot; to appreciate , to feel . &quot;
&quot; in this format , historians explain their history first in their own language and translate them or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devotion and representation result in letting the audience understand . &quot;
they call forth laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video , for example , shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the D@@ af@@ ing language . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara tells the h@@ are and the bab@@ oon in the Sh@@ ona language from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his fairy tale , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you listened to it !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; up to now , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities , and the organis@@ ers hope to expand it . all who are inspired by the project can come into contact with T@@ LS to organize their own story @-@ t@@ ellers . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the US to re@@ establish state debt
&quot; on 3 April 2017 , a number of religious and civil organizations took part in a mass demonstration . the march started at the pu@@ bes@@ cent Capit@@ ol , the capital of the capital , and went to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Bürger@@ front for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting in Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of the re @-@ determination of debts also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Rico want politicians , bank@@ ers and government officials responsible for the debt to be held ac@@ coun@@ table for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we demand financial audi@@ ts and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interest in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding remun@@ eration , which acts in favor of the economy . &quot;
we will be pressed and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not come down with decl@@ ining profitability .

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian Web@@ developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missed for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue to campaign for freedom and remember the contributions he made for an open net . &quot;
&quot; this year &apos;s re @-@ Public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , hosted in Berlin , hosted an event of the # Free@@ B@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ na@@ y , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , a publisher of books within three to five days , read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is freely available here , contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a tribute to b@@ ass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what the real costs are connected with .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements of free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surro@@ unds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , who have been deta@@ ined in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then we have no information about his current state or residence .
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled Coll@@ ective Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , and immediately . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have let us start thinking about their own f@@ ates , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of sometimes extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custo@@ dy of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown place from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer , N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; &quot; military police &quot; &quot; had taken bass on the basis of a &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; command from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that on 12 November 2015 , they were contacted by persons who presented themselves as the insi@@ der of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband . &quot;
&quot; however , its place of residence and state remains unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels cultural prototypes fores@@ aw as the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of many civili@@ zations and here the Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influence . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS would make everything possible to extingu@@ ish this architecture , which not only em@@ bodies the cultural legacy of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this expedition to digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el did not yet complete this project . &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
&quot; I spent my entire life with it , dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in jail . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with each one who asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened me the door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners on how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding them in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a commission which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in detention . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
&quot; she sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed the lyrics to him when she visited him , and he translated it from Arabic into English . &quot;
the book is available ro@@ yalty @-@ free .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ith .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; It happens &quot; :
&quot; it happens every time you visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink into the world of your ad@@ orable eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guar@@ dians &quot;
I forget the crow@@ ding of the prison
and I will go into every detail of your voice and words
that I carry with passion with me
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to bring back all the moments , &quot;
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ sels history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; by 2016 , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in detention since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many more people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has claimed the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we reiter@@ ate our call today in the hope that we must do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique : due to corruption convic@@ ted director after release again on previous post
&quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption case , in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence on which the corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ end@@ ants in 2010 together with four other def@@ end@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was by Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re @-@ ordination to the company , which took place on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office of the Republic , who evaluated the request , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post , as the company did not perform disciplinary proceedings after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many people don &apos;t like the action well . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , condemned the decision of the company to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take note is that even the company should lead a discipline against the conf@@ lic@@ ting question .
&quot; however , the company seems to be silent and does not cause any reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the African social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; disp@@ at@@ ched &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had been taken off . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid speeches and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inf@@ lict damage . &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will gladly be paid for his silence .
disgu@@ sting !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director does not have any mor@@ als : &quot;
&quot; he was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted it , I cannot believe that one rewards one in such a way that has already so massi@@ vely insul@@ ted the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks the morality to return and serve the state , but has already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has instead served itself only by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as a matter of an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief belongs to the prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el not only to remain in memory for the Mozambique Canal , but also as a keen , in@@ significant and - by the way - a proph@@ etic speaker . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral presentations was when he vig@@ or@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man was capable of all , including the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it is not so . it changes tactics , but it does not turn away from its ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious human being is criminal at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also negative : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he spent 10 years and was free . &quot;
&quot; and today the company , in which he lost money , is again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ NI@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ μ@@ ι@@ к , ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12th May 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word Kal@@ ar in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wron@@ g@@ ly
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means ch@@ ick@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Comm@@ ons , Creative Comm@@ ons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the popular social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ors the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; more &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful contents on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically evoke the speech of hate . &quot;
&quot; the context is important and # 8@@ 212 , many people have reported that posts in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubts about their use were cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several bur@@ mes@@ an words with fundamental mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence like &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written in Bur@@ m@@ ically also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( late se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ Kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way , whether they knew how to alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that she will reduce the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also emphasized that Facebook must be more analytical before all posts are extingu@@ ished , which would be suspected of spreading rac@@ ism . &quot;
Facebook removes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ be@@ hook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words side by side .
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( chips ) . &quot;
&quot; the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , have received quite a good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who dissemin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , using social networks simply to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
&quot; when I became aware of this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post from Facebook has been removed and I was forbidden to publish , post and share content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; Facebook Community standards didn &apos;t match . &quot; &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech radic@@ ally nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
the post told the author of why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to l@@ essen rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned such words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ as curr@@ y . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they didn &apos;t try to correct the wron@@ g@@ ly deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they would have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would give them a great turnover , that would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ orship provided a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the web . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which have not contained any hate speech but nevertheless removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
&quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; the post says , &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence , have increased . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks is to hei@@ gh@@ ten violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure , the prolifer@@ ating hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sides . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better , rather in context than on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is concluded with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC BY 2.0 . &quot;
the marriage of children is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law that should prohi@@ bit this practice , so that the age @-@ bearing age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of the married couple , some members of Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities held in practice , and in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , as that is , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened , regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Child Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; every man under 18 years &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it were 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Statistical Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were striving to aboli@@ sh laws on children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly they helped to bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no hes@@ itation to say to the critics of the children &apos;s marriage they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition meant tensions in this actually un@@ complicated situation , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country must agree and let the law proc@@ laim .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators posted a status update on Facebook which re@@ posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
&quot; Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes , and not one single one . &quot;
&quot; after it was approved in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
&quot; the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed , because the laws on children &apos;s marriage had finally been changed . &quot;
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who holds a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk that has conce@@ aled the heart of the cause , but do you know what ? the pa@@ yo@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson was the opinion , it definitely took long enough to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally came : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , , Excellent news ! &quot;
the mar@@ ital has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 on the other hand ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group which openly spoke about the importance of the adoption of the law , noted : &quot;
the age of age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft for the change of the married couple was decided today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 dep@@ u@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present during the vote .
all MEPs who opposed were voted for the law .
the children &apos;s marriage is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # tur@@ marri@@ ages .
many thanks to all activists who challenged him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization in the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take judicial steps , should the law be passed and he seems to be fulfilling his promise . &quot;
&quot; during the General Prosec@@ utor Paris Al @-@ ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj would like to act against the law , most social media users wished to approach the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion as generally speaking , in a way that only panic and arro@@ gan@@ ce can cause us to be mis@@ used instead of the problem that they may be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ ch@@ oked men who are opposed to them , &quot; would you then be prepared to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether there is a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s marriage in different levels is legal or still the norm , although there are laws that they under@@ estimate . &quot;

&quot; on Sunday , the Office of the Prosec@@ utor told the local news service Yar@@ on that they were h@@ acked . &quot;
&quot; by mirr@@ oring websites , Turkish users can look at Wikipedia @-@ contents &quot;
&quot; the Wikipedia @-@ page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally dark@@ ened . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for more than a month , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; day by day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students as well as repor@@ ters and fans of TV series resist the block@@ age .
&quot; although many technologies @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use conversion tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking Article by Wikipedia as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains closed , there are now several mirrors ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are often updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform depos@@ ited all the Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer network ( i.e. host computer connections ) , which is not based on the domain name system and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; in spite of the legal prohibition , the content is call@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in a blo@@ gger , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts : &quot;
&quot; after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we set out everything to disc@@ ard snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the ability to read the content in a de@@ centralized and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror@@ page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors when in the respective country Wikipedia is locked . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni told Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices as well as employees at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a mirror . &quot;
you access a different URL not the original . that what you can see is from Wikipedia .
&quot; essentially , the server re@@ direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia @-@ page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
this is done by a server not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
&quot; a comfor@@ ting r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os , ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly positioned motifs and washed down colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to engra@@ ve the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook like this first @-@ class location in his work helps :
&quot; I live on the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I was at home right at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ eda Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the shore of the Rap@@ ti river it would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately began to bend pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition of N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
&quot; and he ought to know it , for he stood by face to face to tig@@ ers : &quot;
a tiger cannot be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bucket appeared . he sat down immediately , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for fo@@ stering N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ tern@@ es at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations .
take a look at some of these photos below .

&quot; years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;

&quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published by Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international collaborative media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that due to their social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences , they should negl@@ ect the norm to keep this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati ma@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a p@@ seudo @-@ court and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community after having contacted a married relatives with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition does not even call their wives by name , is also widespread among men . however , they have much less legal instructions to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ row in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health professionals as well as house@@ wives , came to a unique club and became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of the 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ning for the de@@ mining of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ i has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera at the discovery of practices , such as childhood marri@@ ages , ban@@ ishing HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ certified , and direc@@ ts these clubs . &quot;
she reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video , which Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion rounds , acted by women who did not name their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify .
&quot; saying that the name of their hus@@ bands is not to be utter@@ ed out , is a custom that they have all du@@ ti@@ sh@@ ly uph@@ eld and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered to be dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about it until this discussion round .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the round@@ table of her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; U@@ h@@ hm .. Howdy there , simply changed into alert to your blog through Google , and found that it is truly informative . thank you and best of luck . Od@@ go@@ vor@@ i &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in luggage Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does this mean they do not respect us ? &quot;
&quot; should it not be equal ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ wel of the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women may never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; a woman was so shy that she ch@@ atted just in front of herself throughout the exercise , and another decided to release the full fru@@ stration of him and his family by cur@@ sing it . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in adren@@ aline rush to have broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands at home . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in the head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law was star@@ ing her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less comprehen@@ sible and the situation led to violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zinc red dot on the forehead , which shows the sp@@ ell@@ atus : &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the zinc red dot if he did it . &quot;
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
&quot; the other women have not stopped completely with it , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives . &quot;
&quot; we make an excursion with every discussion .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who what could hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they d@@ anced and sang and spoke about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these issues for so many years and yet I have never talked so hon@@ estly about some things , for example , as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say some things out loud , no matter how small they happen to be . &quot;
in a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to the clothes .
some women in the group have only worn sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most it &apos;s okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ine cur@@ ta to wear a wide shirt over a p@@ ant , they didn &apos;t dare . &quot;
&quot; after much contro@@ versy and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothing , mor@@ als connected with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( top shirts ) into a round@@ table so that the women could wear them . &quot;
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini are sure they will be able to do it .
&quot; the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed slightly , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly moving : &quot;
we have only done small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then stopped telling the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including myself , do it yet , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the rus@@ hing of more freedom of movement or their own choice - at the end of a difficult to navigate river lie .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they realize they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
but this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

&quot; on June 29 of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag of the Japanese Twitter trend was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a turn @-@ turn in the Japanese culture of post @-@ war era .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , re@@ marked in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just about five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to make the Japanese turn through . &quot;
people here have quickly become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language as English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;

bald men are dra@@ gged and killed in Mozambique
the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia warned the people that bald men could be in Mozambique target of attacks .
&quot; photo : An@@ ders Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of kid@@ n@@ apping of persons for organ traff@@ icking , presum@@ ably for prec@@ arious purposes , distur@@ bs the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently they saw that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are being used .
&quot; there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a man of a bald man can contain gold or bring wealth , explained the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of mur@@ ders for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN in 2016 in the South African country carried out a mission to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and preju@@ dice . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique trip @-@ headed men in Mozambique are the target of ritu@@ alistic attacks , the Mos@@ ambique police warned according to the latest murder of three bald men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the assass@@ inations took place . &quot;
&quot; hus@@ hed Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the town of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police already go following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of bald @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the victims were in the head power , the wealth . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha told the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger &apos;s poor snake , who suggested that the problem is part of the bigger social difficulty facing Mozambique : &quot;
&quot; I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE like to be ashamed of a country where the people would have shame to go on the street and others would not harm or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country where neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ les would be hun@@ ted for for@@ get@@ able purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some have not missed the opportunity for mak@@ ab@@ ren hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; Xen@@ eda Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter users , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange , as well as the police spokes@@ man Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both are bald : &quot;

he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and took part in our meeting in the Arabian blo@@ gger in 2009 .
&quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by persons who were spending herself as the insi@@ der of the Assad administration . &quot;
&quot; they reported that their husband was sentenced to death , but did not give any further information . &quot;
bas@@ sels stay and constitution remained unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
&quot; today and in the future , we are especially honored by Bass@@ el &apos;s work as a pioneer of the Open Web movement . &quot;
and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organizations that have been campaig@@ ning for his release over the last five years .
&quot; since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , thus the Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot;
&quot; countless of those arrested by the regime , or forc@@ efully disappeared , are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions . &quot;
&quot; between 2011 and 2016 no less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in custo@@ dy , thus the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot;

&quot; free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for medical treatment of Nobel Prize winners and dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably only recently done . &quot;
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June , that he had been hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer at the end of June . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ing ) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that requires democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as an &quot; internal matter &quot; and told a spokes@@ man , he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; however , China still receives calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or allow him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u a treatment abroad . &quot;
Norway - Oslo
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway fell in shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government insi@@ sted that this ultimately did nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations continued until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume the loss of salmon to China , as exports have largely been blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
due to his imprisonment he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling for China to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us , as she said in an explanation on June 30 : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to lift all the limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States of America
U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans would like him to have the opportunity to treat overseas in so far as they assist him in his recovery .
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the US emb@@ assy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the emb@@ assy asks the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the call of the US emb@@ assy drew a fur@@ ious answer from China to itself , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and ir@@ responsible observations about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley informed that China should offer the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , based on the Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the US Sen@@ ators , Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Mer@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally . &quot;

Germany - EN
&quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hoping that Li@@ u receives all the medical assistance he needs and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President Xi J@@ in@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Peking of the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had big concerns about whether the vor@@ tex of Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada and Canada
&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called for China to provide appropriate medical care to Li@@ u and give him the opportunity to care about his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um says :
&quot; Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression and freedom to exercise these rights . &quot;
France and Belgium
&quot; France &apos;s Foreign Ministry , in an explanation of 29 June , called for China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o gets all the treatments he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news broad@@ ca@@ ster France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information whether France will finally receive it . &quot;
Taiwan wholes@@ aler and
&quot; on 27 June , the Council of mainland affairs in Taiwan challenged China to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to promote political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the ill @-@ intellectu@@ ally Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u in an explanation on June 28 , and that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and punished for which he had been strictly punished , would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and more prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem sil@@ ly since Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state .
&quot; however , according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be considered as a city . &quot;
this re@@ mark has spar@@ ked a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of an international meeting of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared with other countries . &quot;
he supported Singapore as a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
&quot; that &apos;s it , most people make a mistake . &quot;
I tried to explain that we were different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; turn up the logic &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we hear that ultimately we are not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of escape from responsibility , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended the idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of that , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core of the topic , the good old Ly@@ re returns from the author@@ it@@ arian rulers who pret@@ end to be democr@@ ats , leave the twi@@ sted logic , as it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , the answers given to his American guests concerning our press , our ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary , our political system were really un@@ answered . &quot;
he disgu@@ ised the corresponding questions with non @-@ answers in a rational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng requests Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally think it is a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take the effort to clear this point insofar as he was paid high to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore .
&quot; as An@@ on posted his comment on the blog , he points out the cri@@ tiques that one should start reading the entire publication of the conference so that one can understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the wor@@ ding .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the US ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said , &quot; &quot; Be not a country , &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who as leaders of a mature generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement . &quot;
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - whether I agree or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , member of the new generation of political leaders in Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is right associated and aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review breaks the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; credi@@ ble a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian interpreter ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is both land and city .
&quot; since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s statements are of great importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who has to pay back our Prime Minister Bill ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade tends to affir@@ m , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot;
I have not said what I said ...
this proposition seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapur ...
nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a town / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; the defense of the country , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
&quot; recently , Global Vo@@ ices asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ? &quot;
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series with the rum@@ ors revealed about certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is most put to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; &quot; I said . &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication then mostly follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans cook for Americans in@@ war@@ dly when they are held for Americans , but don &apos;t b@@ other me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know it , there is little difference that distinguishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all are Canadi@@ ans .
Americans however ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves at their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; obviously , we often say &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country in the face of ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much . &quot;
it wouldn &apos;t mind me if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; first , being called &quot; nice , &quot; is basically to be fun - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; Die S@@ imp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) . &quot;
if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders it would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing at which you can push . &quot;
being harmless means to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and not earn any attention .
&quot; this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major property of the Canadian . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps simply cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with neighbors .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has almost made Canada sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a popular pop band in Thailand released a music video that par@@ odi@@ ls the j@@ un@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to dominate the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what prec@@ ep@@ ts his girl@@ friend makes . &quot;
&quot; although not expressly political , the music video directly refers to the continuing military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days , the video uploaded on Facebook was shared 1.@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , as it relates to the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
have a look at these photos of the video that relate to some of the political themes that Thailand has har@@ assed within the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; possibly refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the supreme commander of the army absolute decision making over important national issues . &quot;
&quot; 11 . rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; setting change &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people seen by the j@@ un@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and uncle@@ ar rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army that monitors the online content and accused persons who accused the monarchy , prosec@@ uted the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand uses a strict law against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ ests &quot; ( maj@@ esty &apos;s ins@@ ult ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup in the army .
&quot; one of the problems the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van , before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison , because they suppos@@ edly caused confusion in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should en@@ li@@ ven the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ it@@ ated the sal@@ ute of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ ech@@ em , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society is slowly recovered in east @-@ east @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ c war has been officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ ki@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ tank of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , depreci@@ des , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians have lived and worked together to Soviet sites in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today most of the Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area .
such settlements are also called the gh@@ ost cities in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people still lived here , and today there are only a few hundred people living in these gh@@ ost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , approximately 43.@@ 000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ uk@@ ow@@ kas , are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he starts talking and it is hard for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , it is clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were municipalities , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , all of which served the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable glory @-@ buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha approximately fifty inhabitants live .
&quot; approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ ry@@ osh@@ ch@@ kov@@ s , which still house one or two families , are recognizable by the balconies where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately withdraw . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to take photos , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girl@@ friend and suddenly she leave the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as livestock , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration delivers free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago an older woman called Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; in spite of her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she tells . &quot;
&quot; Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter , and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead . &quot;
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly rent is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; she says . &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A tells us that they and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; when holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; as she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A calls her . &quot; they said we could grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remember the village life before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply fell away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative headquarters in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) . &quot;
&quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives a $ 9 child &apos;s money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
&quot; in the vicinity of the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once held , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and ch@@ ick@@ ens . &quot;
it tells us that it was a very sc@@ ary situation at first when many people left the village after the war .
but over time it lost its anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has rather something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and everyone lived as it was right .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once .
&quot; when our conversation ends up , a little boy runs past us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball scre@@ aming .
&quot; as they run , some of them throw rocks on the deca@@ yed buildings . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , which provide for inno@@ c@@ ence in their lives . &quot;
you do not know it otherwise .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .@@ or@@ g. and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants entering Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula . it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
&quot; led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spectacle frame and gold@@ tone earrings in t@@ ed@@ dy@@ bear form . &quot;
&quot; she is called Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa . &quot;
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about $ 2.50 per night guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - there are still hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you M@@ om Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some also slept outside on cart@@ ons . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medication which they can &apos;t pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if m@@ um Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ call@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bar@@ t ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he replies with a smile . &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
&quot; you have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he says that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel along the track and that the Afri@@ cans are already talking about Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et previously lived in Brazil and worked as a building worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa since months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he replies sm@@ iling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that her guests often send her messages when they have gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants to travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family immig@@ rated to their small house . &quot;
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
&quot; José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children , who wanted to sque@@ eze money from him without having a plan . &quot;
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown one , a single educ@@ ator , gave him her roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the courses the traveler advis@@ es cal@@ m@@ ly their phones .
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;

China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their phones .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users , their own &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in western China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile phone users in Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a phone notification where they announced the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; web cleaning &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged notices with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police , the app would investigate and persec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a security service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
&quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with filters for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or ste@@ al the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reporting on digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focuses on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority @-@ regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit distur@@ ban@@ ces and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ down@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the media outlet , based on Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from In China , &quot; published photos of a Check@@ point , at which polic@@ emen ass@@ aul@@ ted the inhabitants in@@ discrimin@@ ately whether they had installed the monitoring app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile al@@ erts asked people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , it could be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they forced the people to use appliances intended for elderly people .
this is a form of imprisonment through the rest of the rest .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from In China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; top &quot; &quot; ) also released a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , resulting from the fact that the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones are becoming electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang . &quot;
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dis@@ semination of illegal contents .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and affiliated institutes , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office when operating their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , the authorities issued a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs until August 1 , to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a whole series of other possible off@@ enses , including those relating to peaceful religious or political communications . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; Sle@@ ep or death , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane portra@@ ys his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world , you look and find that you are alone in a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth which is clearly recognizable , both from inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes every honour to her name .
one who has broken down into a list of feelings and expressions that don &apos;t allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality reco@@ vers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters transform in beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubt arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even when the Earth continues on the axis of evil . you realize that you are caught here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone by stone . &quot;
&quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security ministry formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five you@@ ths were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds .
it was enough so that the city sh@@ attered the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
&quot; all quarters of the city sought , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , mot@@ ion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that is stu@@ ffed up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had a bit of cal@@ ming after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood . &quot;
I broke the silence by crying several times &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , real friends joined me ; we alli@@ ed us to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations completely and completely . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you release the spirit from the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he put up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice , after you have scre@@ amed it all the way up to the office of security service from the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I am now .
&quot; the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not nearby . &quot;
his fi@@ du@@ ous eyes focused on me .
&quot; and you are wondering what to look into my eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old ; it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
&quot; perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure of my cause when I replied , &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word from what I said . &quot;
&quot; puts him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement , and his father is equal to that . &quot;
&quot; his father is equal to that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the st@@ ench of this cur@@ sed sentence is up to now in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a psychological torture , which I had been exposed for months . &quot;
I passed through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
&quot; after that again through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I detail all the details before I enter the room .
&quot; otherwise , they have probably assigned me a bigger cell this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share them with just one other prisoner and can immediately put me in , without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell and I went back to an old @-@ tried communication method : to strike with the f@@ ist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my short@@ com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; self @-@ chief &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; apparently there was no middle @-@ aged man in the surrounding cells , who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , no prominent facial features can be recognized on me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice is similar to mine ? &quot;
all the answers will deny its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had insured me , they would release him if I remain . &quot;
li@@ ars .
&quot; I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance I still hear them &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always at this time the cri@@ es sound , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented to us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be heard .
&quot; thus the secret was lifted : to protect the state security from us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow viewpoint of their world view . &quot;
this is not a house here that is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their sound into a hero .
&quot; I enter the audi@@ t@@ orium and respond to Abu Ima@@ d , a lean and stock@@ y man ; at least he seems to me . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than to join these da@@ ili@@ es and protest on demonstrations , which will soon come to an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I have used it to not answer .
I can no longer say exactly when ins@@ ults and strikes have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; any voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I didn &apos;t do anything to make this punishment happen . &quot;
punishment in all their variety .
his command is to plu@@ ck me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices at your cri@@ es .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot hold your cri@@ es back . &quot;
&quot; my cri@@ es did not give him enough , which is why they exchanged the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a gar@@ bage collector , or if it belonged to the normal work equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to present us the , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
within a single hour three of them changed while I was still in the line .
&quot; I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and found no favour in it , which is why he was next to an electrically loaded rod . &quot;
&quot; electricity flow@@ ed my entire body , enough to supply my whole district . &quot;
&quot; my half @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect conductor . &quot;
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; a few hours passed , which happened to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , as@@ sh@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; I am answering the voice of an exhausted teen@@ ager : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must worry terri@@ bly . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk away , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free speech and resistance &quot;
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smoked a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he sli@@ ps to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his with ni@@ cot@@ ine sta@@ ined lips .
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family to escape from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with issues such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also demands the heart of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking through boundaries , and he can feel with the people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he defe@@ ats a special rel@@ uc@@ tance against the US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b views his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those trying to survive in war zones , to do anything with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refuge of the second generation , &quot; he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he po@@ urs into water dissolved Nes@@ café into two cups . it is the holy month Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the lu@@ dge of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the check@@ ers of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when you take a look at the neighbouring countries . &quot;
therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in public during Ram@@ adan to drink water in order not to land in prison .
&quot; recently , the Ministry of Interior Jord@@ ani@@ ens announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time . &quot;
some MPs who support the Islamic campaign of action - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contra@@ di@@ cts cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert &apos;s announcement .
&quot; the deputy and former spokes@@ man of the Islamic Coalition , Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert had been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the old @-@ established legitim@@ acy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continued to stand for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement may not be simply rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually reflecting a more and more clearly emerging reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b re @-@ elected traditional gender norms by completing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently un@@ married woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
&quot; in recent years in Jordan , the number of &quot; &quot; Hon@@ our kill@@ ings &quot; &quot; has increased - the in@@ official outside left . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary mor@@ als reached its climax in 2016 ; however , it is still further ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in appropriate ways . &quot;
&quot; according to a law of crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence , can be deta@@ ined at an in@@ definite time in prison , and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort and the family &apos;s guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman . &quot;
&quot; also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from topics , which are long considered tab@@ oo in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he is not able to separate his music , which is full of explicit all@@ usions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and opinion . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics has been sha@@ ken to me , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song named &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b is att@@ acking the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Lav@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse repe@@ ats itself often :
&quot; you are free , and every other is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where , in his words , &quot; that can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay men and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on gender equality have been sharp@@ ly cens@@ ored by LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals until 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya in order to later mem@@ ori@@ ze that his comments were torn from the context , distor@@ ted and cens@@ ored in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but was stre@@ amed but only a revised version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b bu@@ ys openly for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als is not speaking to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ die , a poet of the eighth century , still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ die , who was supposed to work on behalf of the pot@@ assium in the eighth century , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality , why can Jordan do this ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ite Kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service held several former government members and members of the teacher &apos;s association , with the reason they had cri@@ tically expressed themselves cri@@ tically on comments in social media , which inter@@ cep@@ ted with the corruption stran@@ gl@@ ed in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ians . &quot;
&quot; Jordan has prevented M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes . he is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of experiencing it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will become a real and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , scatter uni@@ tions , and arti@@ fici@@ ally @-@ called demo@@ cra@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; until it is ready , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will further tow and consequently resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ ri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; one assumes that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the solid cars , drums and dancing mar@@ ched over more than a thousand years , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the emissions to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we had a great view . &quot;
it is difficult to imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time now : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking nature to spend its summer : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot;
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ in festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange arms against sc@@ iss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

&quot; outside appearance and body care have rarely been as important as in this story , because they help to keep Peru@@ vian youth from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitimate career like that of the bar@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital city of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street ro@@ b and illegal drug trade are all @-@ day . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Peru - as many other Central and South American countries - are experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; to copy the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can reproduce these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; un@@ parall@@ eled demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there experts compete against each other in order to show who of them can create the more ec@@ centric ooks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions like the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dressing , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of their successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because we have built this educational community with love for the children . &quot;
Colombia : letter of love to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters

use with friendly permission .
the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; love messages to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea after T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not even more important , people who feel attracted to aff@@ ection aff@@ ection ? &quot;
this is precisely the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Youth Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ ación ( Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ciliation ) that encourages young people to write letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
&quot; only recently , their country was the venue of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa campaign F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces Colombia ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
the sign of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos for his mer@@ its received the Nobel Peace Prize .
&quot; in front of the Colom@@ bi@@ ans , however , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ err@@ il@@ la@@ gh@@ er , who lived in illegal camps for many years , had been exposed to war rh@@ et@@ oric and carrying weapons around the clock , must now be integrated into the life as a civilian . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , once again ac@@ custom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now enter into their ranks and support them in building up a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans had to join together and help with the integration process .
&quot; and that &apos;s exactly what they did : so far , thousands of young people already wrote letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters in order to welcome them back to society . &quot;
&quot; the goal of the campaign is 69@@ 00 Let@@ ters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter , who will then be handed over personally . &quot;
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation was established on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we write down thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more . &quot;
&quot; he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed most urgently . &quot;
&quot; so the plan was to write letters of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and to build a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ ic@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
&apos;@@ I never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ sort Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC set themselves up as they had done before to take the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but a letter full of encour@@ agement from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; the Political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a told later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience so : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former fighter forced me through the gu@@ err@@ illa fighter camp . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , as next to him on the bed there was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ row@@ er , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; and I said to him , &quot; &quot; Hi , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I am answering a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I reply to it . &quot; suddenly tears ran me over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I hu@@ gged him very ti@@ ghtly and sat down beside the gar@@ den@@ ers .
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , was tired of being all the years of loyal companions of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC , was the only way to save him and his six brothers before the death death . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society outside that wa@@ its for us with open arms .
&quot; until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; at the start of the event , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were invited to a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
&quot; this is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years , we have experienced how the state of social injustice has affected the entire Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party , we can help shape society more just . &quot;
&quot; the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who had never heard a hearing before and had no choice , and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated even hate people with beautiful feelings that were revers@@ ed by their circumstances and their environment was very painful to me . &quot;
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
&quot; but it comforts me that all people - even those who killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the camp command@@ ant of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the City of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bi@@ ans prophes@@ ied that after the dis@@ ar@@ ming , peace would reign . &quot;
but that is not the case .
&quot; as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people who are ready to resort to arms , rise and protest for their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifice , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ ova , whose first publication took place on OC Media &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; gay and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ ca@@ sia region are exposed to a wide range of haz@@ ards - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ext@@ or@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; with terror , activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hangs over the LGB@@ T@@ Q community about the LGB@@ T@@ Q community does not come into existence only overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that discussed the deport@@ ation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Ch@@ echn@@ ya authorities who captured suspic@@ ious qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she was grown up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen learned about the gender ine@@ quality of their country@@ woman , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened . &quot;
&quot; from fear of her life , she moved to the USA last weekend . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
&quot; when I was watching a few shopping bags from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a men &apos;s voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; how long do you still want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you che@@ que ? &quot;
I did not know the person .
&quot; I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and wo@@ ke up again in the hospital .
&quot; apparently , some women had everything to get along and started to scre@@ am . &quot;
the man fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung . &quot;
OC media : in which p@@ oultry have you been laid - in which the men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am thank@@ ful for him that he has been resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all this was a lie .
&quot; they ordered absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender , that all was only bad talk and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have Kör@@ b@@ chen@@ Height C - what should I say on TV ?
OC : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still difficult for her .
some elderly people once spoke my m@@ um on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family but the entire republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she lay down a rope around her neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
&quot; I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window , a car with dark window pan@@ es and a number plate with a 95 included . &quot;
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights activists checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I leave Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without registering myself , without reference , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the gar@@ bage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you &apos;re in security just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people know in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is number 115 .
can you imagine it ? !
this was indeed my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; but we don &apos;t talk about the gender ine@@ quality , that is a tab@@ oo subject . &quot;
some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements I am still wearing in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this mental barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt her . &quot;
&quot; if we chat with camera , I am really forced to look like the person she rec@@ alls from her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : last week I submitted a report in Washington .
for him I need up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has imprisoned in ar@@ gun one and a half months .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan no men were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that everyone could hardly wait for the end of Ram@@ adan and he did not lock up a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; I mean , they probably invite relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are even now gay men deta@@ ined in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there wouldn &apos;t be so many .
&quot; if , then especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped from their relatives in order to put Kad@@ y@@ rows judgment . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are deta@@ ined there so that they can be presented as terrorists later . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on TV and pret@@ end they would have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply gone , but aimed to radic@@ alise themselves . &quot;
OC : is this only a presum@@ ption or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone deta@@ ined in ar@@ gun one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard has grown .
there has been nothing new from them since then .
they simply took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken along . &quot;
&quot; until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports yet . however , we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and kid@@ n@@ app@@ ings of people , which belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , took place in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always carried my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think already before 2003 I was already known all over Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I was living there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
seriously !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was true , I had never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia wanted to bring us to the &quot; &quot; Ci@@ vili@@ zation &quot; &quot; originally , but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were hat@@ ched , I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore silk jeans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria never made me a hair curved .
&quot; in front of the Russian Theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there . &quot;
we were never off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that is called &quot; Cave not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
they often say to children if they make funny about the sick .
&quot; OC : so they just closed their eyes to you , because they believed that they were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never off@@ ended me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot;
OC : how long did this time of grace pers@@ ist ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began speaking about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us per se , but mainly about the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel how people began to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; he who laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , looked at you once with suspic@@ ion . &quot;
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic constantly wor@@ sen@@ ed . &quot;
OC Media : which activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards . &quot;
I had no c@@ ents for it for a long time .
I discovered these people myself when I picked up the all@@ ure places .
I am Muslim and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
&quot; so , nature is , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to prophes@@ y to you with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no bo@@ ils with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have those who have the Cab@@ ard@@ ins , the Russians also have what ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , therefore it is uncomfortable to hear anything like that . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think about transi@@ ti@@ ty to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of feeling , to be exact , different life settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry that I will be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong rise in suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ combustion of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 backed the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he ashamed for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness that could arise for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi Human Rights groups who wish to work and remain anonymous in Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he ign@@ ited himself .
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to Tal@@ eg@@ ama hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything . &quot;
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only suicide which occurred within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority in August , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take their lives . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have imposed . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : it was all family patri@@ arch@@ s , who felt hel@@ pless and in@@ capable of feeding their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; Ah@@ wa@@ zi is suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region in which a majority of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi family living in Iran has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to make their living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took power and in 1925 took great efforts to end the ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated disease , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime systematically ref@@ uses the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs to systematically create jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab territories into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness in the region , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the rate of unemployment among Arab A@@ haw@@ zi people now rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Manager for co@@ oper@@ atives , labour and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ ra@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % a secondary school , and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance .
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi Human Rights Activ@@ ist resi@@ ding in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ men . &quot;
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions prefer not to recru@@ it Arab labour , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is depri@@ ved of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood beyond their hom@@ etown of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired as even Arab names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , let alone speak Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances given by the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi , human rights activists propose alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world w@@ akes up and takes notice of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional ? &quot;
detail of a photo . taken by Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Comm@@ ons license .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay well thought out scientific and social arguments ahead of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for instance , despite equal education , women still earn less money than men . &quot;
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women encounter a glass ceiling before or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination continues across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and thre@@ e@@ fold .
I am a black woman .
&quot; yet , if I come to speak on skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black women &apos;s women , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been mis@@ used in racial seg@@ reg@@ ation and discrimination , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and to sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to say that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence , which we are exposed to black women in two ways . &quot;
or that black women and women earn less than white men and women than white men and women of origin .
that black girls and girls with a migration background often refer to school as white girls because of obvious integration problems .
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership , than white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join a movement in whose centre is the white woman who ref@@ uses to consider injus@@ tices in their thinking , which relate both to gender as well as to the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white @-@ femin@@ ist oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; in 18@@ 51 So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense an ent@@ ailing and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs by cultural acquisition to advance their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to expose white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping skin color and sex . for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them a better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women from different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from the white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to divor@@ ce myself completely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever before , that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana bet@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming ourselves ( such as Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ) by placing ourselves in our own way , in which the cultural , mental , emotional , physical , and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is concerned . &quot;
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I will be recognized as part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can thri@@ ve in an environment in which my life has neither passed nor ignored nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports in@@ particular about international efforts to resolve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years , mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern for Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . its mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations . &quot;
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in his community .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization of Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance , which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no more water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film based in Er@@ bil , Iraq , and multimedia journ@@ alism . &quot;

the following article is the shor@@ tened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by cur@@ tural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ less @-@ smoking ) reported on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the persons affected .
&quot; a police comm@@ iss@@ ar told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who was opposed to violence . &quot;
&quot; some time has passed since the end of her relationship , and the police said that her statement would be put to the ac@@ rob@@ ats , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed due to ill @-@ treatment , the clear indication of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez did not use anything . &quot;
a few days later the second woman returned her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women ever make ad , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence , must at all report to the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; content 1 Stri@@ ke and statistical 2 In@@ visible mal@@ treatment and a legal system , that does not under@@ ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , faul@@ ty implementation of pun@@ ches and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ riam Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender questions at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot;
but the available numbers are al@@ ar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads went on for domestic violence at the District At@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s Office . 70 % of these were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courses . here , too , 86 % of the ads of women came here . &quot;
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; &quot; on every woman , who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for mental abuse , 9 women who do this do not . &quot;
&quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded due to physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not an own crime , prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; alone until August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of genocide in the country . &quot;
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator of Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ments and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then after that , she was supposed to regret it forever . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos , but for two years she carried out the psych@@ ic violence on his side - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognis@@ able : &quot;
I would never have thought that I would become victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happened to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they are dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on abuse by Carlos Vera .
she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against her and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of ill @-@ treatment . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had enjoyed the so long of Carlos and did not leave it earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of mal@@ treatment would have at least some complic@@ ity in it .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who was not from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that her former partner was ill @-@ treated . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you , &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot;
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women serious .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
&quot; finally , her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as Ads among the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; it took a trial against its former partner , which developed into an in@@ transparent legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was primarily about money , power , and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach ; poor implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the indication of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ ein@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill of law was discussed in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , which was announced under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # für@@ sten ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os Movement ( # Non@@ on@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ izi@@ d has to declare and to pun@@ ish fem@@ ici@@ des as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; thus , the bill was changed in some points in order to also win the dep@@ u@@ ties for the law that feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions would be paved , which are currently illegal in Paraguay and be punished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill had fores@@ een the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence must bear on their own , if they simply furnis@@ h display and want to get a safe place to impose the state . &quot;
&quot; ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective , if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient funds for it : &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relations . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates himself and contributes to the fact that the perpet@@ rators will get away . &quot;
we must pay as long as the abuse continues until ill @-@ treatment is no longer considered to be normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been altered . among other things , a passage was cancelled , which the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the submission of words &quot; sex , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media continue to face attacks in Oman one year after the ban
&quot; this website was blocked due to a decision by the Minister of Information , &quot; read on the homepage of the For@@ bidden Newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he served a prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and brought to justice . &quot;
&quot; since 1970 , Oman has been governed by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had depos@@ ited his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; he has since compla@@ ined of his role as the only sult@@ an , the most important mini@@ stries in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the planning and president of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the Sult@@ an is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , especially of domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , including public freedom , including press freedom , to prosec@@ ute and torture independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically reduce peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights , including activists , to express their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which corruption in Oman has been reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 an article entitled &quot; High @-@ level parties bind the hands of the ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; this was about corruption in the ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in court decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman , to raise a verdi@@ ct in an inheritance dispute . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; high @-@ level parties bind the hands of the ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot;
source : fac@@ ebook@@ site of Az@@ am@@ n
&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editorial board , was invited by the ISS to the special department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS celebrated the Deputy Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the instruction that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any road , including online , from 9 August 2016 is prohibited . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both sentenced to &quot; &quot; abuse of the internet &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; under@@ mining &quot; &quot; of the state . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of a prohibition of public@@ ity and slan@@ der . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of prison sentences and fin@@ es of 3000 om@@ anian ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to one year prison and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network for distributing material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a damage deposit of 5000 om@@ anian ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) was fixed and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the pron@@ ounc@@ ement of the sentence . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced him to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six @-@ month sentence from the Central prison in Mas@@ kat .
the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to go back , the newspaper still faces attacks by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the Minister of Information issued a statement with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and the minister once again placed himself against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ als to permit the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the continuing closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper is not the only cases in which in Oman in recent times the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated .
&quot; other injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalists al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to end the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Iranian authorities : &quot;
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman bear their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial cler@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ governmental and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association , and the right to gather together peac@@ efully and provide them protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ ri@@ ers 2016 in Zambia , shown with his agreement &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons for medical research being carried out on site : firstly , there are a number of medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover specific medical needs on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have severe consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research carried out by African scientists is helping to develop their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic revealed first serious effects on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ is@@ iana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the Sam@@ b@@ ish health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( AG@@ M ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results . I support the Sam@@ b@@ ish national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; I am also starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;
GM : what do you think of the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain the recipient , rather than being a maker . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not well applicable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently well .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /
which obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory equipment is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /
&quot; RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is demand for special academic education , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this . &quot;
&quot; GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa in comparison with Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here . &quot;
the system that journals can only make available for payment ( the so @-@ called Pay@@ wall ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky &apos;s contribution was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ standing M@@ outh , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many Sal@@ ad varieties he can get , limits set . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding . &quot;
&quot; patents help not only for individual types , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green ton or curved leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or card varieties . because of this trend , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a m@@ illen@@ nia of tradition , Mort@@ on is still breeding a salad , but he now needs more , since his work is more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions . &quot;
it is as if in a river there would be a b@@ oul@@ der in order to d@@ ull .
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go far too far . &quot;
&quot; and when they stand in front of court , nobody can breed a new kind of salad because all features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and endeav@@ ours to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the US and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
&quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman sal@@ at of the variety Out@@ standing M@@ outh in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station , where it is tested whether plants can be grown in space . &quot;
photo : NASA
it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software . &quot;
it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant bre@@ eders .
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ SS@@ I , US bre@@ eders can commit themselves to being able to freely use the seeds bred by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; gro@@ wers only allow others who buy their seeds to breed it , and not immediately sow - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the professor at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and the O@@ SS@@ I board member , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security as well as for environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to seed , seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
&quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg empha@@ sizes that the &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; movement does not work with gene@@ tically modified plants . &quot;
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot;
&quot; food sovereignty , without sovereignty , is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing their seeds at their disposal , in contrast to pat@@ enting seed and plant features . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered because the available gene pool is shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore becoming more restricted . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , director of the O@@ SS@@ I , has engaged in her PhD @-@ thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all card features are protected as intellectual property , which makes it difficult for plant bre@@ eders either at all or only difficult to use . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , there are still no estimates , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that massive grown plants such as wheat are still patented in an even larger style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots . &quot;
a Question of S@@ ight
&quot; plants are bred in such a way that they have deliberately undes@@ irable tra@@ its - from such , through which their taste or color improves , because of which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is decreasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more pressing than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse predic@@ tible . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; however , it contra@@ di@@ cts that intellectual property rights other bre@@ eders as &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations encourage innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
&quot; thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovations but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on sees that different : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait so long to breed into plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , the struggle would have been lost . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders do not have time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; overall , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics ourselves . &quot;
&quot; the plants form them themselves and as bre@@ eders , we ultimately have no idea how plants do it . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , Plant Bre@@ eders in the US state of Oregon and O@@ SS@@ I , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety breeds its own values in it too . &quot;
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures for their cultivation are needed to produce a mass of her@@ b@@ ici@@ des grown in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
my concept is very opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create most of the smaller seed companies to survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on is looking for Sal@@ ads in his breeding garden .

&quot; in addition , Mort@@ on believes that bre@@ eders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like me with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years themselves , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent one is protected 20 years ahead of competition , which makes it very easy for my opinion . &quot; worldwide response &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly across the globe . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in resources , is an open source seed programme . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seed and sell their own .
&quot; the German Organization Agre@@ col works on an open source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SS@@ I obligation for bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for breeding are different from country to country , so the O@@ SS@@ I obligation cannot simply be taken one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , states that conven@@ tionally cultivated plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on open source seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend for pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for open source seed systems , states that the organization is currently building a global alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems for the scheduled next year of the official launch . &quot;
&quot; an association of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - is a network of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published in this report . &quot;
&quot; the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a connection , by the Lu@@ by of O@@ SS@@ I , hopes that more people will soon recognize him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has taken particular attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their foods . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock content on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about it . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network has published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains stable despite this attack and the ridi@@ cu@@ le of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend this part of the world and to give victims a voice . although it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it was never as important as it is now . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first licensed website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites over two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era network for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of Web page@@ views victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no longer exists in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the spread of articles and articles , which he writes for non @-@ accessible websites and media in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he established to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the target of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider at which is also a resident of Canada blog , is still available . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video , as the police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mostly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government and reflected what this meant for him : &quot;
&quot; to block blogs is very old , but has been a priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ disa@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of the blog is not meaningful for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been possible for them to give me the feeling of a si@@ ege , an arrest , an attempted murder , over@@ charging by the National Security Council , the block@@ age of blogs as well as any other web page for which I worked . &quot;
2 ) They have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words : my words have influence even though only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I took it to the post of articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; but now after they have blocked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the courage@@ ous are going through the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this resulted in technical testing in networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in addition , af@@ te documented the block@@ age of providers , through the circum@@ vention of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing was possible , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) . &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ PN@@ s offer began . &quot;
such practice points to the government &apos;s intention of continuing to block and filter contents to the Egyptian users .
&quot; the situation is also exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ oring decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which it can proceed to court against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are fighting .

&quot; day after day newspapers all over Brazil speak with dark news from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old at school shot , &quot; &quot; E@@ very second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe rus@@ hes a pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , na@@ vy and air@@ field to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation in 2017 , the wave of violence reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio . &quot;
the Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; the paper &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; , &quot; known for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on 16 August , published the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which it announced a new section called &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explains the motives for their decision :
&quot; extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crimes , etc . everything that happens from civili@@ zed standard and what happens in Rio will be published in the category &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper stated that this decision is not an event for pride but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distor@@ ted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , which first sho@@ ots and then asks questions to cover . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , against the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in her opinion a justification of failed security policy by the media and could complic@@ ate the police to account . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital . &quot;

&quot; to call Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie in the north and northeast of the country according to statistics of 2015 . these are the most recent data available . &quot;
none of these cities is located in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the mur@@ m@@ ons per state , Rio lays on number 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , is one of the largest media companies in South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the security policy of the state for many years . &quot;
&quot; these security policies also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit established by the state of Rio in 2003 to capture a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police raid and permanently station@@ ing a unit there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases . since some years , the U@@ PP has been increasingly under bombar@@ d@@ ment after several reports of man@@ ic@@ ans and repression against the poor communities that actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set by the Geneva Convention for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war involves serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to use means and means typical of war . to this end , the intru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; with which a civilian is an in@@ variable point in the landscape , and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; distor@@ ted bul@@ lets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
one week it is now that the police climbed up the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit vendor died as a result of shots that the police had fired from a helicop@@ ter . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal attack and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; under Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , there are currently about one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib . &quot;
&quot; the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition , based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations , have been committed by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these re@@ bel @-@ controlled areas have been besi@@ eg@@ ed by rebels outside Damascus , which led people to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; due to the years of block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academ@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the common foods in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the director of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been struggling for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it now wins more and more &quot; awareness . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to raise money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform cand@@ o in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to provide 125 families knowledge to pl@@ anting mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12.@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations for cand@@ o by Monday , September 04 , 2017 . &quot;
the initiative depends on generators that keep temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of fuel shortage , locally produced plastic prop@@ ell@@ ants are used in order to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds from the regions &quot; &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this was successful , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; educational farm &quot; &quot; for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have spread mushrooms throughout Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a for free . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la said that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom @-@ breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : frac@@ ture of si@@ ege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; dis@@ semination of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coff@@ es@@ et , cardboard , etc ) to acquire new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities attached to their home .
he said : &quot; we hope to spread this idea all over the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and si@@ ege will become visible .
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
&quot; several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts in Portugal on October 21 , and called for justice for the victims of the fires that were depos@@ ited in the north of Portugal in the week . &quot;
forty @-@ two persons died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government to last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
bran@@ dies were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were over 500 out@@ breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest monitoring system monitored by satellite ima@@ gery in 2017 alone , about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the gravity of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15 October , 2017 &quot;
some of Twitter users shared images :

numerous videos are spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into the events :
the fores@@ e@@ eable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prev@@ ent@@ ative and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ ão sover@@ al of the Federation of farmers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; according to Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday , they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of accounts of open roads that were surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in Lei@@ ria &apos;s forest , a similar tragedy like in June could have happened again as the roads were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permits are questioned in locations with high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching reform proposal brought by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ected by the local authorities , who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed the construction activity to fall , if the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open back door so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Gr@@ val goes on in the same article from P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees made of easily inflamm@@ able wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , continued to spread to fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these issues include the website of Portugal &apos;s Civil Defence on 15 and 16 October , seeking information or trying to contact relatives , offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used the own civil protection data using the f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt application and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .

the way from Afghanistan to the successful entrepren@@ eur

&quot; one night in the autumn of 1994 , the occupation of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belonged to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother did not say it then , she knew that she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy was to break up . &quot;
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat Party leader of Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara sli@@ pped suddenly . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hate for the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ a found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
&quot; for a couple of years , he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick . &quot;
&quot; then he took what was left of his little reward , and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged bags with mortar that were he@@ avier than he himself to earn his livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; at that time , like today , Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran were characterized by poverty and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ p remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , on which we also worked . &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we hang@@ ed nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not fro@@ ze at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ f left his life without the papers in Iran and made ready for the trip to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and landed on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ a was hom@@ eless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church distributed twice a day food to aid need@@ y . &quot;
&quot; it is true that due to relatively high levels of awareness , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is also true that the conditions for asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel .
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially apply for asylum - which can still go for months after registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ per .
&quot; but his un@@ restra@@ ined way of life helped A@@ shar@@ per , to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions soon . &quot;
&quot; after several years working in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ f stuck his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
A@@ shar@@ a Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; in 2017 , the film received the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some Afgh@@ an firms have emerged , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea for his restaurant Oriental Experience where the wa@@ iters and the staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the dining menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy due to the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Peace &amp; amp Restaurant in Pad@@ ua . Sp@@ ice and also behind the Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na Pizzeria in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ an .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims , however , far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and the retail trade and aims back to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ a with a smile . &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ a is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; so they can sell their harvest surplus and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ a has made this journey himself , and now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path . &quot;

&quot; the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill , which stipul@@ ates that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government agency . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use social networks , users must register within six months of successful legislative decisions on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number . &quot;
anyone who fails this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the confin@@ ement of a penalty .
&quot; the law , which was promoted by sixty MPs , is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of parliament filed a legislative proposal in which tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the President or a high civil servant would be introduced . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the ins@@ ult of the President and state institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the law proposition , such action would be punished with imprisonment and fin@@ es , so juris@@ dic@@ tions of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he exercised violence against demonstr@@ ators , who demonstrated violence against the military coup that had led to the resolution of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; he waited , like more than 700 participants , who had been arrested during the same incident , four years in jail for a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th of May , because the prison administration failed to bring the def@@ end@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room according to human rights groups . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , false exposure of such weapons , illegal assembly , murder and murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal tri@@ bunal in G@@ iza told two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalist Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested during the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunis@@ ian activ@@ ates inter@@ rog@@ ated to scann@@ ed documents
&quot; in May Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent Na@@ wa@@ at media platform as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was ch@@ aired by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , expressly supports a controversial law draft which would guarantee business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption called Official Am@@ nesty . &quot;
&quot; published on 21 April at the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , a light on how the Pres@@ idential plans for supporting the legislation will look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia declined the nom@@ ination of his sources , stating that article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian Press Bo@@ xes , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he appeared in the district court in Tunis on 9th May as a witness in the event . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identity ?
&quot; according to new rules of the Information Office of the National Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share news in social media . &quot;
the regulations also indicate that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts suggest that the elimination of anonymous comments should be achieved within social networks . it is uncle@@ ar how the authorities will apply these rules .
&quot; Chinese citizens have suggested in social media to only sel@@ ectively en@@ force these regulations , in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence . &quot;
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked Russia &apos;s access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat , in the state government , failed to register as &quot; organis@@ er of dissemin@@ ating information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this term is part of a law dating from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government performs a list of online services that provide the &quot; publishing of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make bes@@ po@@ ke services responsible for the removal of content and to force them on request to susp@@ end user data . &quot;
&quot; these web pages are currently websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ class@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru@@ . and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court has wi@@ pes Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ruled the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administration refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data , Turkey supported the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication announced that the page was closed because it &quot; &quot; a source of information that co@@ operates with groups to pose a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey is completely blocking the website . it is therefore , among others , China , one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
great Britain can &apos;t stop trying to sni@@ ff
&quot; after this week &apos;s scann@@ ed documents , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers which would force Internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and to install Backdoor programs that encryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal , however , has om@@ itted other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
