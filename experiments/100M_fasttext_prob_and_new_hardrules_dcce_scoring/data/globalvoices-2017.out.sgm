<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is exceptionally great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and practised his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound impact on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Brief, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, revealed the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were inclined to be interested."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," "I was as if it was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA was only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very swarming loving letter written about its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes about with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never thinks of the mountain as you say so nicely.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague expresses it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmericans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and tuned in droves for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number ever reaching a nominee by the party."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, which takes people from all over the world, a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"also, trumps of worldview did not coincide with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"mumps Intolerance also contradicts the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who struggled with the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it still fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with lots of patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew leakey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, who helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump was running his way to the nominate Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, I almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to order the people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, have voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can barely forget the words of David Remnick, who commits the cruel decision to lift a man looking down with contempt on those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "whitelash" "(note d.): as much as" "cassertion of the whites against all other ethnicities" "; word play from white in allusion to the whites and whiplash, which means the great Van Jones, has killed exactly what America has made so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have, America is welcome everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"but with the choice of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to Hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"at a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" "asked Mr. Khan."</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd replied with a loud "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" "roared the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried out, and their voices became louder. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son was pleased, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is now a mumps country," "said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">"the" Recycled Instruments Orchestra "by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC."</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican Music School of the Vicente Guerrero community in Oaxaca province common to the children of the Paraguayan town of Catentura?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music played at both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the rubbish</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for several years now, the La banda de música (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the resulting poverty with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for Vicente Guerrero's church in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and the gangs of gangs."</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare hope for hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty roads to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the guzz you learn day by day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Catentura - a village located at the top of the biggest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments manufactured from recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with remanufactured instruments, made up of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Catentura, where the Recycler under the direction of Favio Chávez began to convert pieces of waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"the instruments imitate ghosts, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made out of the garbage."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music and music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musician teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the beginning time:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first, it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">That changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a converted violin made of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra that plays instruments from remanufactured material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like humans in Catentura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring scenery from garbage to music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release occurs as part of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the Liberian waters before it sought the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a law breaker of this species to its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles were swiftly mobilizing against the ship."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "all of a sudden, the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply refused," "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a leading clerk of the Kenyan Fisheries Administration. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"in the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of the plundering of the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, in 2012, founded by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishery)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that were expelled from their waters at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "with this we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand up to each other where illegal fishing is concerned," "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught will be hidden, so it is extremely difficult to trace why illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing from regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"by deliberate disregard of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate equilibrium."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once hindered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions are now in real-time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, for example, the individual countries can exchange listings of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i also closely monitors the activities of ships when they move on the open sea, via satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships which fish in forbidden areas. also, suspicious driving routes can be discovered - such as those suggesting that a ship charges its caught fish on the road to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fish fancience where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal spirit."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries which are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their harbours, meaning that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced into the numbers of punishments, as in the case of the Premier."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "there is a considerable financial loss for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of nfds Africa. the latter is a consultant company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the previously mentioned platform was created to win an estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover, which will lose the eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of the illegal fisherman who invade East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries that attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also equally illegal fisherman.</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include like sailing under false flag, fake license papers, indication of fantasies, fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the missing international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-volatile organized control system," "says Long." "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say 'You don't attack my harbour'."</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now."</seg>
<seg id="125">"until now, the closed front operates."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed forged licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships which used several fraudulent identities and it has persecuted and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international agency for combating crime, FISH-i can share and receive information on illegal fishing over long distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that should help FISH-i to pinpoint suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track the illegal ships that love to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fisherman uses very sophisticated techniques to conceal their activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fishery data and offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be detected by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping build a system that connects different levels of information. FISH-i will help to find criminal acting ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team can actually influence African nations on the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Worldwatch platform together with Google and the Oceana marine conservation organisation: a platform that provides satellite data and can display the position of each single trackable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing what is doing, it simply makes sense, "he says." here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do so on a global scale." "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project in which a global system permits prosecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which used to be fished without a licence and hardly anticipated with consequences now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i meanwhile have a 33% increase in fisheries turnover, since fishing boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board Schleppnetze, whose use is banned."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we are a study object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"there were six countries united in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they too are fighting illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "with security the aim is to let even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to announce its first major triumph: in October, it represented Greko 1, a ship under false flag. and not only the ship was on the road without a license and were used towing nets that are banned by now."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also invaded in forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working in the entire world sea. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes about the environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>
<seg id="152">"their articles appear in Wired Magazine, TED Education, the New York Times and the Guardian. situation in Venezuela continues to escalate: demonstrations in several cities with the aim of returning the country"</seg>

<seg id="161">"many of the opposition representatives saw in the removal of the current President Nicolás Maduro, the chance for a fundamental change; in the end, however, the deposition of a new election was blocked by the official authorities."</seg>
<seg id="162">"Marianne Díaz, contributors to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in their latest article the context of government decision as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"in the context of the social, political and economic crisis, where inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine, the referendum needed to give the country the chance of recapitating its institutional structures and closing a new government alliance."</seg>
<seg id="164">"the electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or short MUD (for example: round table of the Democratic Unit), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces. in addition, a 12-hour strike on the Following Day and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government headquarters, planned on 3 November, should continue to persist in the blocking of the referendum."</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times after La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to get out. he took me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a little bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were placed and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Then the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">"I rolled in, and saw a couch, on which men were tortured."</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a cot and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they fastened one end of a cable to it. the other end was attached to the body of the person who had just been tied there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they tied up a man with handcuffs on the bed, poured it with water and chased him 220 volts into the genitals."</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench there was horrible... like a dirty wind.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father stood under house arrest, the same smell came from his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell right away and it became clear to me that it is the smell of a body in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew that these people were killed</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he took me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were captivated with handcuffs and were wearing glasses."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke with" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also accused in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">"in the background, I saw a number of mattresses on which naked men lay down with the face down - all were tied in hands and feet."</seg>
<seg id="252">"near the entrance, people kept quiet on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed I saw the prisoners, he said," "What do you do, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">I replied "Why did you otherwise bring me?"</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know that because my father told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero put together a man and killed.</seg>

<seg id="263">"if you look at the map, you see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanization.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from above came that they should be laid."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - euphemism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their dead bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'War Grails'</seg>

<seg id="270">"but when I was in the military myself, I was in the gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war was a bayonet or perhaps military emblem, which one takes to an enemy that one has fought."</seg>

<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at Gendarmerie and I would never be able to enter into a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal, and I replied," "You, who are driving cars on the street?" ""</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>

<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he still brought clothing home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defense, a co-conjer accused me of being at this crime. I replied, no problem, they can lay my burden on what they wanted."</seg>

<seg id="299">"I always asked myself: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">It would have been easy to put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it has just been decided to kill these people, but why do their bodies disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not have families that could be handed over to their mortal remains?</seg>

<seg id="308">Just to make it clear: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even at Gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">"the thought of showing my Father arose during a conversation, when he stood under house arrest."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for translation, one needs two important abilities: passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the source language - native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from the French into English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language, which could produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers wishing to learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who do not have foreign employees themselves, can make translations still in-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and puzzling propositions created by machine translation show that this technique cannot replace any human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages very special.</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic prints, which often decorate t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be still acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry, but by large companies or government who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations."</seg>

<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money passes their minors son or their minor daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, an education and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"however, what is not mentioned is that the children have to afford countless days of housework, which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that one cannot raise."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the practice described as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay, due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organisation that fights for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she talked with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated through the Criaditas is generally still silent."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double illusion," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family, who is their daughter in the belief that they will complete their education, improve their position in society and" make something out of themselves "to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family who assimilates the girl and justifies her exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no schooling, and perhaps even starved."</seg>

<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was Criadita in the household of the former military-member Tomás Ferreira and his wife, Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>

<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">Some days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela formed the criadazgo practice rooted in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They designated Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>

<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day."</seg>
<seg id="461">"in doing so, she had to share the time so that you still have time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, she cleansed the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school ended, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the sooner she was done with learning, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>

<seg id="502">Sixty-five Egyptian MPs backed a draft law on "the regulations regarding use and benefits of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"when adopted by Parliament, users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would then be established that is entrusted to citizens to use a permit to educate social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months with acceptance of the law, users must register on the site of the site with their correct names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill which consists of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video, and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how the Egyptian authorities should make the registration. unclear is also how they should account those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, Member of Parliament and supporters of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users who received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to block Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook, because of which it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it has not yet been known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are skeptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>

<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they pretend that just as they violently control physical public and private spaces it could be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, that means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who require a permit or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to lead them to a court process."</seg>
<seg id="517">"this is technically not realistic, but in Egypt everything is possible."</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be passed as a law, the draft must first be discussed with the Parliament's legislature and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether its adoption and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft is in line with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in whose interests the control is maximized and will be ensured that no different narration is present on the image area," says Raoof. "</seg>

<seg id="528">"how Raza shows in the video" "is the Persian Leopard the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem depends on the fact that a big predator is present."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild wild is low and goes against zero. when the video shows that they have a picture of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>

<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring prisons Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate because the tsunami had all coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"the Fukushima prefecture has still suffered a nuclear accident, already alone for this reason that 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">"Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows, from a local point of view, what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents."</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics from the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of those affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"the apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the Fukushima Prefectures, Miyagi and Iwate Prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was the biggest success among the three prefectures, here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such homes, whereas Fukushima produces 70 percent of the rear light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"however, even six years after the catastrophe, Evacuated von Behel's lodgings (their own, kasetsu juutaku) are still trying to relocate to final replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the threefold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in homes."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such homes."</seg>
<seg id="557">"nearly 40 percent of Fukushima evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuated ones who were hauled after the disaster in homes were resettled to final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">* Use five-year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures concerned</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to investigate, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by misfortune were reopened until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 percent of the fishery ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of fishing harbours have resumed their operation in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident occurred in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of land in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fukushima lie in the" nuclear plywood. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far off."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the accident. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>

<seg id="576">"in its issue for the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also reinforced its attention to the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima not only had to witness the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima Prefecture was also witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear incident that Japan had ever had."</seg>
<seg id="578">"nearly 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the prefecture of 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23,000 people were resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent substitutes."</seg>
<seg id="580">"according to the 2017, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas most of the evacuees, who still live in homes, are older than 50 years old. they have to come back in proper habitation because the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects."</seg>

<seg id="627">"Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, who is located in the Western Cuban province of Mayabque, is widely known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill regardless of the fact that there is no appreciable sugar harvest locally."</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories have been laundered.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after the rest, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the smells of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories which still exhort.</seg>
<seg id="633">"Nene, a soldier veteran who rises every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep."</seg>
<seg id="634">"he heard that in the east of the region there are sugar cane moldings, which are in operation after a long inactive period of time, because they were obtained."</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">"Nene recalls exactly that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the sugar cane industry resisted already the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change."</seg>
<seg id="638">"in 2016, production was 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910."</seg>
<seg id="639">"the news would have been a motive for the country for some decades, but the bad harvests are no longer news anymore."</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway station of the church already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">"the reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity. 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and they became unbeatable for the country."</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the global market.</seg>
<seg id="648">"nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago."</seg>
<seg id="649">"from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 published report of the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organisation."</seg>
<seg id="650">"if the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country."</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities throughout Canada are concerned with topics that are important to them. they do it through hip-hop thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour since 2014, workshop leaders will bring mobile studios directly to schools and youth centers to teach songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree Hip-Hop group The NorthStars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop refers to the fact that the young participants in conversations contain topics such as" cultural identity, language, engagement, love, self-acceptance, "or whatever comes into mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the territory of the tribe of the Kitsumcalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of Tears, "a road section in West Canada, where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were vanished or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not elucidated.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of maintaining traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people do not always master the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the WhapMagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus will be sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the young people involved received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstar Hip-Hop group, who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree."</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcript, as well a translation into English translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you will take our cry.</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as a youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and as well as our youth go ahead</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, will be exhibited in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (" "plastic models of dishes" ") of any food that is served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers are watching these plastic dishes and then decide if they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the Tokyo district of Kappa, there are a variety of small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so usually that they do not even notice them. however, a new trend is now turned into showy mobile phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"at Naver Matome, the blog writer itinii published several social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin dépuru."</seg>
<seg id="725">"now in special sale: new with plastic straps decorated cell-ribbons, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store."</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods were turned into kitschy collectibles, as in this case, fridge magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin refrigerator magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of the essentials becomes increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an imperial-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was transformed into a cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile stands and mobile designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"someone who would say:" Wow, cool, now can I decorate my mobile phone with salmon?. ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic bags can also take a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also paddies (onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">"further skurrile plastic dishes can be viewed at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter to the hashtag #, more than benzene has a lot of taskbar shopping."</seg>
<seg id="743">"if you like to know more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappa that is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous" struggle against drug trafficking "in Mexico, the versts and those killed regularly only show up in statistics. however, these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings with it."</seg>
<seg id="750">"the report on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, completely squeezed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or on the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind each corpse, behind every bone finding in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project" Aprtiva Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" live with drug trafficking "), which is to give this victim a voice and tell stories of people who fell in the battle between the law enforcement authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime cannot only be feared for our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for instance, when shops close, because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore whole communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">Pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video called "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear life changes") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches for his son every weekend."</seg>
<seg id="761">"Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on a single day."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" "like every Sunday, we are also preparing ourselves today for the task we have set ourselves to go and search for graves, according to the people we have loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electrical store in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th, he should be back again, but he never came again." Emma Veleta said: "it's very difficult for me because I am now alone with three children who need education."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is with me here too."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment they have no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are the insurance of my father, but she does not pay them out because they require a dying certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the federal state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it appears:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known illness and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass every day to newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with images that can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect towards the person that once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug trafficker) when he is big. and it's not normal that people listen to songs about the" heroic deeds "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, it is as if they mourn the ones who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become bloated numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the ingenuity of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the enforced disappearance of 43 students in an adjacent ort would be justified, that they were" "possessions". ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to say that they will be spared of such tragedies, if they do not stir and remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" Four months of blackmail in the capital district: "as a family with threats has been plundered," she describes how armed criminals were pressed for month money from their business until they did not only destroy the business but also broke their family apart. "</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can change your whole life completely in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain of this never goes, the trauma remains, the fear comes back high once you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers also."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the more we are apart from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because they don't know when they will deceive you or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"in these terrible days I wondered if weeping would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a Generation of Violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is an orphan and he says he had to teach himself how to cook a egg, potatoes, tortillas warm and" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and that he had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood had been over two years before, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, saw bloody corpses of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">"Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was mixed by the organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez."</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of killings according to the Public Security Council and the Government of the Government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone the public prosecutor called 3103 Morde. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories still live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the" Aprtiva Vivir Con El Narco "project, Animal Político has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank truck crossed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, dumped and exploded. 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected and devastated for years. the streets in the region became dangerous paths filled with potholes, which were difficult to navigate."</seg>

<seg id="831">"a picture with the title" "This is Nigeria". "from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12. January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of that day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies lined up on the ground while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not find its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo was recorded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram grabbed the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically from atrocities in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." no one stayed back to count bodies, "said a inhabitants to Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many had been shattered, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">Only by means of satellite images the follow-up time could be depicted.</seg>
<seg id="844">"the occasion for the attack was also unsolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo again when it was mistakenly presented as proof of the fact and possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this abusive use of the DR DR image is only one in a series of false attributions; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the image was presented as a receipt for mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"one step further, personal comments such as this example wrongly convey the image of the DR Congo with sources of mass media related to arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a flash announcement, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee could punish punches, rape and some dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported on the violence against the Rohingya, posts like the following items appeared, describing these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this picture was taken from an Saudi-Arab news site, which frankly claimed President Myanmars Thein Sein have said that monks and politicians had participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the picture from DR Congo to expose this information."</seg>

<seg id="917">"United States, 2015."</seg>
<seg id="918">"the picture was weathered as evidence of the Boko Haram massacre (and more than 9.300 times saved), but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context."</seg>
<seg id="919">"instead, the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison between Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo."</seg>
<seg id="920">"Vietnam (Vietnamese), 2014."</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and Images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the assassinations of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued as compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Understanding religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">"however, a deeper question is what happens if readers cannot believe this picture any longer."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are tens of people who intentionally share the water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue, and the actual horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo, Nigeria and in Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent pictures has already been extensively debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that the retention of images of a refusal occurs to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even asked by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that forcible images desensitize readers and viewers and take the ability to empathy (such as this study, which investigates how violent media seem to help others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, it is a fact that it is essential for today's news coverage."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists experimented with algorithms to support the fight against" "fake News". "they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be extracted from the context or to completely misused species."</seg>
<seg id="940">"however, each examination of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be."</seg>

<seg id="1140">"in fact, urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or Oakland in the United States where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass death of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces, in which inhabitants don't have to forget who they are to belong to."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while listening often to understand" "these events instead," "these events instead" listen, "to appreciate, to feel."</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, historians explain their history first in their own language and translate them or explain them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and representation result in letting the audience understand."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call forth laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video, for example, shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the Dafing language. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country."</seg>
<seg id="1148">"in another event, John Nyamusara tells the hare and the baboon in the Shona language from Zimbabwe:"</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after explaining the meaning of his fairy tale, John Nyamusara is asked:" how is this to an audience that doesn't understand your language? "with a wide grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You listened to it!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"up to now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organisers hope to expand it. all who are inspired by the project can come into contact with TLS to organize their own story-tellers."</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for the US to reestablish state debt</seg>
<seg id="1155">"on 3 April 2017, a number of religious and civil organizations took part in a mass demonstration. the march started at the pubescent Capitol, the capital of the capital, and went to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Bürgerfront for the neural examination of debts) and the ecumenical church meeting in Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the re-determination of debts also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Rico want politicians, bankers and government officials responsible for the debt to be held accountable for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we demand financial audits and a Steering Committee without personal interest in public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding remuneration, which acts in favor of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We will be pressed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not come down with declining profitability.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"therefore, the so-called" Centre for New Economy, "a non-profit non-profit organization without party affiliation with a focus on socioeconomic development, proposes a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state supervision."</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">Measures imposed on outside will risk without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people.</seg>
<seg id="1171">"the demonstration was called" "night watch for light and truth". ""</seg>

<seg id="1185">"this year's re-Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, hosted in Berlin, hosted an event of the # FreeBel campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1186">"Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, a publisher of books within three to five days, read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: collective research)."</seg>
<seg id="1187">"the book, which was published last year and is freely available here, contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what the real costs are connected with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements of free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our different experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers, who have been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book entitled Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, and immediately."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have let us start thinking about their own fates, deeds and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of sometimes extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015 Bassel was transferred to an unknown place from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer, Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "military police" "had taken bass on the basis of a" "strictly secret" "command from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that on 12 November 2015, they were contacted by persons who presented themselves as the insider of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, its place of residence and state remains unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels cultural prototypes foresaw as the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of many civilizations and here the Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influence."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he started working with this work, the IS would make everything possible to extinguish this architecture, which not only embodies the cultural legacy of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this expedition to digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel did not yet complete this project."</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my entire life with it, dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with each one who asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened me the door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners on how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding them in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a commission which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in detention."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">"she smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him, and he translated it from Arabic into English."</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available royalty-free.</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mozambique reacted with anger to a corruption case, in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence on which the corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants in 2010 together with four other defendants."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was by Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re-ordination to the company, which took place on April 19."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General's Office of the Republic, who evaluated the request, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to return to his old post, as the company did not perform disciplinary proceedings after his detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many people don't like the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"in an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), condemned the decision of the company to re-establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in terms of the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that even the company should lead a discipline against the conflicting question.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company seems to be silent and does not cause any reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the African social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "dispatched" ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had been taken off."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could hold paid speeches and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent he consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says, the director does not have any morals:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"he was rewarded by the state because he insulted it, I cannot believe that one rewards one in such a way that has already so massively insulted the state."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks the morality to return and serve the state, but has already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has instead served itself only by the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as a matter of an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remind that a thief belongs to the prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">"thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel not only to remain in memory for the Mozambique Canal, but also as a keen, insignificant and - by the way - a prophetic speaker."</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word Kalar in Myanmar and censored many users wrongly</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or splits.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the popular social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censors the word" "Kalar" "or" "more" "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful contents on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"'Kalar' may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically evoke the speech of hate."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important and # 8212, many people have reported that posts in which they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubts about their use were censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several burmesan words with fundamental meanings that have the same character sequence like 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written in Burmically also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words such as' Kalar pae '(late se),' Kalar OAT '(camel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The FacebooKnutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends in a witty way, whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" "healing" "(ku) + the question word (la) in Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that she will reduce the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also emphasized that Facebook must be more analytical before all posts are extinguished, which would be suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook removes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on Facbehook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words side by side.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar pae "(chips)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, have received quite a good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, using social networks simply to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">Author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post from Facebook has been removed and I was forbidden to publish, post and share content for 24 hours, because the post" Facebook Community standards didn't match. ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech radically nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">The post told the author of why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intent to lessen racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned such words as" chair "or" peas curry. ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they didn't try to correct the wrongly deleted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they would have a little more respect for the 15 million benefits, which would give them a great turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship provided a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the web."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which have not contained any hate speech but nevertheless removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"just to try out if Facebook removes the mail, which contains the word Kalar."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"screenshot, used with permission."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"the post says," If you are a doctor, then heal people? "</seg>
<seg id="1335">"screenshot, used with permission."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists, who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence, have increased."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks is to heighten violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in Rakhine, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"Facebook has been criticised for its failure, the proliferating hate speech on its Burmese sides."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better, rather in context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them."</seg>
<seg id="1340">In Trinidad & # 038; Tobago is concluded with the children's marriage</seg>
<seg id="1341">A wedding ring in the sand.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The marriage of children is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"on 9 June 2017, Parliament of the country unanimously approved a law that should prohibit this practice, so that the age-bearing age is now at 18."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"before this change of the married couple, some members of Hindu and Muslim religious communities held in practice, and in May 2016, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere, as that is, age does not determine maturity."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"this happened, regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN Child Rights Convention, the minors as" "every man under 18 years". ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">"statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and at 18 it were 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the Federal Statistical Office of the country confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 in 1997-2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movements that were striving to abolish laws on children's marriage, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly they helped to bring about this result."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no hesitation to say to the critics of the children's marriage they were supposed to take care of their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition meant tensions in this actually uncomplicated situation, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was decided against the children's marriage - despite 4 Senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree and let the law proclaim.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators posted a status update on Facebook which reposted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">"Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was decided in the House of Representatives with 35 votes, and not one single one."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"after it was approved in the Senate, the draft can now become a law."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"the majority of social media users were thrilled, because the laws on children's marriage had finally been changed."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"Facebook member Lovell Francis, who holds a ministerial office in the Ministry of Education, said:"</seg>
<seg id="1360">"it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk that has concealed the heart of the cause, but do you know what? the payoe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth every price."</seg>
<seg id="1361">"while Abel Jackson was the opinion, it definitely took long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentral-Thomas was overjoyed that the day finally came:"</seg>

<seg id="1393">"for more than a month, Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing based encyclopedia Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1394">"day by day, it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students as well as reporters and fans of TV series resist the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many technologies-savvy Internet users are used to use conversion tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking Article by Wikipedia as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"according to China, Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform remains closed, there are now several mirrors (pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are often updated)."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform deposited all the Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized Peer-to-Peer network (i.e. host computer connections), which is not based on the domain name system and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">"in spite of the legal prohibition, the content is callable."</seg>
<seg id="1402">"in a blogger, IPFS reports about its efforts:"</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after we have heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we set out everything to discard snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the ability to read the content in a decentralized and distributed way."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to bypass the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a Mirrorpage from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors when in the respective country Wikipedia is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni told Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices as well as employees at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"it is not a complete copy of a proxy-address, a mirror."</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL not the original. that what you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">"essentially, the server redirects the request to the correct Wikipedia-page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves if they are locked in Turkey."</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and washed down colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to engrave the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown, next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook like this first-class location in his work helps:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live on the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I was at home right at home when suddenly Navarre (manager of Chitwan Geda Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the shore of the Rapti river it would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">"my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was and I immediately began to bend pictures!!"</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition of Neptune's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he ought to know it, for he stood by face to face to tigers:"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be bothered by the opinion of the sheep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the bucket appeared. he sat down immediately, we see ourselves and he stares me through the Sal trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo" "I click for conservation" "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"however, his passion for fostering Neptune's nature and wildlife is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Otternes at the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published by Video Volunteers, an award-winning international collaborative media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women with the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that due to their social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences, they should neglect the norm to keep this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati maatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by a pseudo-court and violated by her family and the village community after having contacted a married relatives with names."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition does not even call their wives by name, is also widespread among men. however, they have much less legal instructions to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walrow in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health professionals as well as housewives, came to a unique club and became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of the 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, it is part of the # KhelBadal campaign operated by the community of Video Volunteers and campaigning for the demining of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pai has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera at the discovery of practices, such as childhood marriages, banishing HIV- and AIDS-certified, and directs these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, which Rohini showed in their discussion rounds, acted by women who did not name their husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"saying that the name of their husbands is not to be uttered out, is a custom that they have all dutishly upheld and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered to be deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about it until this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the roundtable of her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Uhhm.. Howdy there, simply changed into alert to your blog through Google, and found that it is truly informative. thank you and best of luck. Odgovori"</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in luggage Rohini started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does this mean they do not respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">"should it not be equal?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Pawel of the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition, in which married women may never pronounce the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that she chatted just in front of herself throughout the exercise, and another decided to release the full frustration of him and his family by cursing it."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in adrenaline rush to have broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands at home."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in the head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law was staring her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less comprehensible and the situation led to violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinc red dot on the forehead, which shows the spellatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would wear the zinc red dot if he did it."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not stopped completely with it, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make an excursion with every discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to worry about who what could hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and spoke about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these issues for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example, as our identities to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say some things out loud, no matter how small they happen to be."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most it's okay, but some wanted a saline curta to wear a wide shirt over a pant, they didn't dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothing, morals connected with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of Kurtas (top shirts) into a roundtable so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini are sure they will be able to do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed slightly, Rohini confirms that things are slowly moving:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only done small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then stopped telling the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including myself, do it yet, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the rushing of more freedom of movement or their own choice - at the end of a difficult to navigate river lie.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they realize they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" News of those who experience it themselves, "and provide a hyperlocal context to report global human rights and development challenges."</seg>

<seg id="1586">"at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi."</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and part of the organs had been taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently they saw that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi are being used.</seg>

<seg id="1591">"another group, the goal of murders for obscure purposes, are people with albinism."</seg>

<seg id="1629">"the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June, that he had been hospitalized due to liver cancer at the end of June."</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for" Subversion "(state endangering) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that requires democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as an" internal matter "and told a spokesman, he considered it" not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country. "</seg>
<seg id="1633">"however, China still receives calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release or allow him a treatment abroad."</seg>

<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway fell in shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government insisted that this ultimately did nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations continued until December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the loss of salmon to China, as exports have largely been blocked since 2010."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>

<seg id="1654">"the call of the US embassy drew a furious answer from China to itself, with the utterance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that" no country has the right to interfere and irresponsible observations about Chinese internal affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley informed that China should offer the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice, based on the Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations."</seg>

<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>

<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domain Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem silly since Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"however, according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of an international meeting of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"that's it, most people make a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we were different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "turn up the logic" in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we hear that ultimately we are not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of escape from responsibility, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended the idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of that, he inevitably appeared undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the core of the topic, the good old Lyre returns from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leave the twisted logic, as it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"at the end of the last week of Shanmugam, the answers given to his American guests concerning our press, our judiciary, our political system were really unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He disguised the corresponding questions with non-answers in a rational manner.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng requests Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally think it is a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the effort to clear this point insofar as he was paid high to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">"as Anon posted his comment on the blog, he points out the critiques that one should start reading the entire publication of the conference so that one can understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the wording.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was rather a" city "than a country," he explained why the elections in Singapore are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and just elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the US (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said," "Be not a country," "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as leaders of a mature generation, makes such a polemical statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - whether I agree or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of political leaders in Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is right associated and aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review breaks the weak points of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam" "credible a mistake" "or was it a Freudian interpreter?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only considered as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, what country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is both land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, Mr Shanmugam's statements are of great importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore do their military service, they only defend their city but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who has to pay back our Prime Minister Bill?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the magazine Journey of a Decade tends to affirm, Singapore is and has always been a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I have not said what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition seems to have annoyed many people of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a town / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements such as" the defense of the country, "etc., but that is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defence of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1739">"recently, Global Voices asked his editors: what is the most misunderstood aspect of your home or homeland?"</seg>
<seg id="1740">Their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series with the rumors revealed about certain parts of the world and another facet is to be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">"the latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is most put to me in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I am sorry," "I said." I am from Canada. "since 1994 I live in Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification then mostly follows the standard answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature. "many Canadians cook for Americans inwardly when they are held for Americans, but don't bother me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know it, there is little difference that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians get a Canadian flag well visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All are Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans however....</seg>
<seg id="1750">"so it was already when I began travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11."</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried small maple leaves at their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors.</seg>

<seg id="1754">Same-sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">"all seem to think, Canada is so great."</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">"obviously, we often say" sorry. ""</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is said to be the most tolerant country in the face of ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">"first, I have many American friends, whom I admire very much."</seg>
<seg id="1763">It wouldn't mind me if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">"but there are also some problems with the stamp" "nice." ""</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first, being called" nice, "is basically to be fun - like the good-natured, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" Die Simpsons "(which has its own Canadian Doppelgänger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really would be a nation full of people like Ned Flanders it would be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing at which you can push."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be unobtrusive and uninteresting and not earn any attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from things that happen around you."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a major property of the Canadian."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders call "nice" is perhaps simply cool politeness.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence with neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">"we lack the warm, open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends."</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show Canadians are more than just "nice." our prime minister has almost made Canada sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1781">"the new song" "Dictator Girl" "(Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what precepts his girlfriend makes."</seg>
<seg id="1782">"although not expressly political, the music video directly refers to the continuing military rule of the Junta."</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>

<seg id="1786">"last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video" The Dictator "in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video."</seg>
<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, as it relates to the situation of the country under the Junta rule."</seg>
<seg id="1788">Have a look at these photos of the video that relate to some of the political themes that Thailand has harassed within the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of the girls "possibly refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives the supreme commander of the army absolute decision making over important national issues."</seg>

<seg id="1792">"for this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army that monitors the online content and accused persons who accused the monarchy, prosecuted the monarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand uses a strict law against "Lese Majests" (majesty's insult).</seg>
<seg id="1794">"on 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand."</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup in the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">"one of the problems the Junta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van, before putting them into an internment camp, another problem."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"some journalists are in prison, because they supposedly caused confusion in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should enliven the monarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1799">"meanwhile, the teaser of the songs showed members of the band who imitated the salute of" The Tribute of Panechem, "which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014."</seg>

<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez leads a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org. and appears here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants entering Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula. it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"led by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink spectacle frame and goldtone earrings in teddybear form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called Concepción González Ramírez, and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about $2.50 per night guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - there are still hundreds of African and Haitian migrants here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez, the people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mom Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some also slept outside on cartons."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them medication which they can't pay, they massaged them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived a short time ago."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if mum Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"the family Sebastiao (with her daughter Mercalli, who has a yoghurtbart) posing with Concepción González Ramírez."</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," "he replies with a smile." "I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"you have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and the Africans often travel along the track and that the Africans are already talking about Mrs Ramírez on Whatsapp.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet previously lived in Brazil and worked as a building worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy became weaker, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa since months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he replies smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells that her guests often send her messages when they have gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants to travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family immigrated to their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">"José Antonio Cordova Meléndez told me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children, who wanted to squeeze money from him without having a plan."</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown one, a single educator, gave him her roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses the traveler advises calmly their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who went away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she smiles in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there are one of her daughter with African hairbands that she has made a lady, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly as she briefly imagines her.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeats every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users, their own"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile phone users in Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi received a phone notification where they announced the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" "web cleaning" ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the announcement, it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they, shortly after they had installed the app, had exchanged notices with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the communication of the police, the app would investigate and persecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a security service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while reporting on digital censorship in China mostly focuses on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority-regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit disturbances and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the media outlet, based on Twitter-based media outlet" Images from In China, "published photos of a Checkpoint, at which policemen assaulted the inhabitants indiscriminately whether they had installed the monitoring app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile alerts asked people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, it could be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They forced the people to use appliances intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment through the rest of the rest.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from In China" ("" top "") also released a Jingwang product description, resulting from the fact that the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer. "</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones are becoming electronic handcuffs in Xinjiang."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and affiliated institutes, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office when operating their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities issued a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs until August 1, to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards "at the local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist "videos. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a whole series of other possible offenses, including those relating to peaceful religious or political communications."</seg>

<seg id="2008">I broke the silence by crying several times "Allahu Akbar" from my house roof.</seg>

<seg id="2061">I can no longer say exactly when insults and strikes have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>

<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaib's family to escape from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with issues such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also demands the heart of the entire Arab world."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking through boundaries, and he can feel with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not admit it openly, he defeats a special reluctance against the US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib views his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those trying to survive in war zones, to do anything with his identity as a" Palestinian refuge of the second generation, "he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances," "says Hdaib."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a man, "while he pours into water dissolved Nescafé into two cups. it is the holy month Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the ludge of lukewarm coffee and the checkers of the Kent-cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when you take a look at the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in public during Ramadan to drink water in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Ministry of Interior Jordaniens announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic campaign of action - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno contradicts cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert's announcement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the deputy and former spokesman of the Islamic Coalition, Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had been cancelled due to the sexual orientation of the singer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the old-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "which continued to stand for intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement may not be simply rhetoric, but actually reflecting a more and more clearly emerging reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaib's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib re-elected traditional gender norms by completing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently unmarried woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in recent years in Jordan, the number of" "Honour killings" "has increased - the inofficial outside left."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary morals reached its climax in 2016; however, it is still further aggravating that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in appropriate ways."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law of crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence, can be detained at an indefinite time in prison, and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort and the family's guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from topics, which are long considered taboo in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he is not able to separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics has been shaken to me," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song named" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib is attacking the question of the Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" "Lavla al 3aib" "and in" "ghareeb", "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeats itself often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every other is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where, in his words," that can get what you want "- be it faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay men and lesbians and that comments on gender equality have been sharply censored by LGBTQ + individuals until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya in order to later memorize that his comments were torn from the context, distorted and censored in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was streamed but only a revised version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib buys openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance towards homosexuals is not speaking to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nudie, a poet of the eighth century, still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nudie, who was supposed to work on behalf of the potassium in the eighth century, could openly write about homosexuality, why can Jordan do this?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the Hashemite Kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service held several former government members and members of the teacher's association, with the reason they had critically expressed themselves critically on comments in social media, which intercepted with the corruption strangled in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"Jordan has prevented Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes. he is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of experiencing it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will become a real and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, scatter unitions, and artificially-called democracies."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is ready, Hdaib will further tow and consequently resist."</seg>

<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one assumes that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the solid cars, drums and dancing marched over more than a thousand years, in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emissions to the knees."</seg>

<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - as many other Central and South American countries - are experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"to copy the trend, appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can reproduce these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"unparalleled demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been held since 2014."</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the contribution "love messages to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea after Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not even more important, people who feel attracted to affection affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Youth Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (Letters to Reconciliation) that encourages young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their country was the venue of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla campaign FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces Colombia), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">The sign of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos for his merits received the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"Guerrillagher, who lived in illegal camps for many years, had been exposed to war rhetoric and carrying weapons around the clock, must now be integrated into the life as a civilian."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, once again accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now enter into their ranks and support them in building up a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian convinced that the young Colombians had to join together and help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and that's exactly what they did: so far, thousands of young people already wrote letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters in order to welcome them back to society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the goal of the campaign is 6900 Letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter, who will then be handed over personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters to reconciliation was established on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we write down thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but those who need them much more."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plans to share his love with people this year, who needed most urgently."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan was to write letters of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and to build a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cali, Manicales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogotsort Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set themselves up as they had done before to take the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no orders, but a letter full of encouragement from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between, "the Political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila told later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience so:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former fighter forced me through the guerrilla fighter camp."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, as next to him on the bed there was a MGL-pomegrower, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I said to him," "Hi, what are they doing?" "he answered," "I am answering a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I reply to it." suddenly tears ran me over the cheeks. "</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him very tightly and sat down beside the gardeners.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, was tired of being all the years of loyal companions of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC, was the only way to save him and his six brothers before the death death." I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes. "</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside that waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the start of the event, students and some leaders of the FARC were invited to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"this is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years, we have experienced how the state of social injustice has affected the entire Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party, we can help shape society more just. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"hearing these people who had never heard a hearing before and had no choice, and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated even hate people with beautiful feelings that were reversed by their circumstances and their environment was very painful to me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people - even those who killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the camp commandant of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the City of Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">"the Colombians prophesied that after the disarming, peace would reign."</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities exist, there will always be people who are ready to resort to arms, rise and protest for their rights. and this is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifice, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"there will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs over the LGBTQ community about the LGBTQ community does not come into existence only overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grozny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published that discussed the deportation, torture and killing of queer men in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Novaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechnya authorities who captured suspicious queer men and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transwife, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since childhood, she felt that she was a woman in reality."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she was grown up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chetschenen learned about the gender inequality of their countrywoman, the hunt for Sabrina was opened."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"from fear of her life, she moved to the USA last weekend."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them all over the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me."</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents made the round through WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">I was attacked on 10 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was watching a few shopping bags from the backseat of my car, I heard a men's voice saying," Here is a gift for you from your uncle. ""</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "how long do you still want to dishonour the family, you cheque?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">"apparently, some women had everything to get along and started to scream."</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung."</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC media: in which poultry have you been laid - in which the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for this.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am thankful for him that he has been respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya to prove that all this was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they ordered absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by running through the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Grosny and say that I had not changed my gender, that all was only bad talk and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have KörbchenHeight C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke my mum on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," They have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family but the entire republic. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she lay down a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window, a car with dark window panes and a number plate with a 95 included."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I leave Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without registering myself, without reference, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't believe, you're in security just because you left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know in which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"but we don't talk about the gender inequality, that is a taboo subject."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements I am still wearing in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I can't overcome this mental barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"if we chat with camera, I am really forced to look like the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: last week I submitted a report in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him I need up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has imprisoned in argun one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan no men were arrested and tortured, but also that everyone could hardly wait for the end of Ramadan and he did not lock up a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"I mean, they probably invite relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand proof that the so-called" honour "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are even now gay men detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there wouldn't be so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped from their relatives in order to put Kadyrows judgment."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are detained there so that they can be presented as terrorists later."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on TV and pretend they would have attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply gone, but aimed to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC: is this only a presumption or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone detained in argun one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken along."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports yet. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people, which belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, took place in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always carried my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think already before 2003 I was already known all over Grozny, when I was living there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was true, I had never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia wanted to bring us to the" "Civilization" "originally, but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC: how is this possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were hatched, I had colored eyelashes, wore silk jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Safety of Sharia never made me a hair curved.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian Theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is called "Cave not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children if they make funny about the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC: so they just closed their eyes to you, because they believed that they were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never offended me, never hunted and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC: how long did this time of grace persist?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began speaking about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us per se, but mainly about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel how people began to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"he who laughed and laughed before, looked at you once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic constantly worsened."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: which activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacreffs, gatherings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I had no cents for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I picked up the allure places.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so, nature is, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to prophesy to you with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no boils with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have those who have the Cabardins, the Russians also have what; on the whole planet they exist - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, therefore it is uncomfortable to hear anything like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think about transitity to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of feeling, to be exact, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry that I will be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase in suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the last few months, there has been a strong rise in suicide."</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-combustion of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 backed the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he ashamed for his own helplessness that could arise for his family, so Ahwazi Human Rights groups who wish to work and remain anonymous in Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to Talegama hospital in the town of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide which occurred within the Arab Ahwazi minority in August, and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take their lives."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have imposed."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: it was all family patriarchs, who felt helpless and incapable of feeding their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Ahwazi is suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region in which a majority of the Arab Ahwazi family living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to make their living."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and in 1925 took great efforts to end the ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets little of this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated disease, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ahwazi-Arabs to systematically create jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a variety of dams, the water from the Arab territories into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to devastation caused by dryness in the region, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The rate of unemployment among Arab Ahawzi people now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Manager for cooperatives, labour and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahrazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% a secondary school, and 45% have a university degree."</seg>
<seg id="2421">Systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohihimi, an Iranian Ahwazi Human Rights Activist residing in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, "led to a" high rise "in the number of suicide among young Ahwazi-men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since functionaries and institutions prefer not to recruit Arab labour, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood beyond their hometown of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and to be hired as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone speak Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances given by the Arab Ahwazi, human rights activists propose alarm before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world wakes up and takes notice of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify with feminism, even with the intersectional?"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. taken by Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay well thought out scientific and social arguments ahead of me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for instance, despite equal education, women still earn less money than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women encounter a glass ceiling before or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination continues across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"yet, if I come to speak on skin color, on racism, on black women's women, on black women in the LGBTQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been misused in racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, all agree that women - all women - should come together to" lift up their voices and to sing "Kumbaya, my Lord" to achieve equal rights (some) women. "</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to say that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalised form of racist-motivated violence, which we are exposed to black women in two ways."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women earn less than white men and women than white men and women of origin.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background often refer to school as white girls because of obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership, than white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join a movement in whose centre is the white woman who refuses to consider injustices in their thinking, which relate both to gender as well as to the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white-feminist oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851 Sojourner complained in her speech:" "am I not a woman?" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense an entailing and marginalized being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs by cultural acquisition to advance their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to expose white women the importance of overlapping skin color and sex. for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded to give women from different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from the white feminism, there is still the word" feminism "in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to divorce myself completely from feminism and join the movement of Womanism, which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever before, that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana betanism: reclaiming ourselves (such as Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves) by placing ourselves in our own way, in which the cultural, mental, emotional, physical, and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned."</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can thrive in an environment in which my life has neither passed nor ignored nor rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2466">Paddling against pollution: a man's mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations</seg>
<seg id="2467">"Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine which reports inparticular about international efforts to resolve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published here again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">"again and again Nabil Musa travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years, mostly with surfboard or canoe - with a special concern for Kurdistan region in Iraq. its mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in his community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child," "says Musa."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that decades of war, construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the Non-Governmental Organization of Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance, which is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarises the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" if we had no more water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and published for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary film based in Erbil, Iraq, and multimedia journalism."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of her work lies on persecuted, poorly respected subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia technologies, whose help oppressive communities can tell their stories in their way."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by curtural. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weightless-smoking) reported on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissar told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner who was opposed to violence."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"some time has passed since the end of her relationship, and the police said that her statement would be put to the acrobats, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as another woman Balbuena showed due to ill-treatment, the clear indication of Ada Báez did not use anything."</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman returned her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women ever make ad, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence, must at all report to the law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content 1 Strike and statistical 2 Invisible maltreatment and a legal system, that does not undernimmt3 Paraguays laws: good approach, faulty implementation of punches and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to determine how many women are really abused, says Myriam González, researcher for gender questions at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">But the available numbers are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, 9600 ads went on for domestic violence at the District Attorney's Office. 70% of these were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courses. here, too, 86% of the ads of women came here."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women said they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, few of these crimes are actually indicated." "on every woman, who is refunded in Paraguay for mental abuse, 9 women who do this do not."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"on every woman who is refunded due to physical abuse, two women who do not do this," she declared at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder in Paraguay is not an own crime, prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"alone until August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of genocide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator of Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatments and a legal system that does not undermine</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then after that, she was supposed to regret it forever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos, but for two years she carried out the psychic violence on his side - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognisable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never have thought that I would become victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happened to women who are too submissive because they are deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">She wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised his hand against her and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of ill-treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had enjoyed the so long of Carlos and did not leave it earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of maltreatment would have at least some complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who was not from Paraguay, fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that her former partner was ill-treated."</seg>
<seg id="2517">"Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo (" I believe you, ") that consists of women who are all victims of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women serious.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">"finally, her affluent partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless."</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victorias Ads among the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives, she received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"it took a trial against its former partner, which developed into an intransparent legal battle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was primarily about money, power, and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays laws: good approach; poor implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the indication of abuse is a way of resistances and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," "says Victoria Santos."</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echeinri, a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay, also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill of law was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament, which was announced under the hashtag # PorEllas (# fürsten)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos Movement (# NononeWeniger) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law stipulates that Femizid has to declare and to punish femicides as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"thus, the bill was changed in some points in order to also win the deputies for the law that feared that the way for the decriminalisation of abortions would be paved, which are currently illegal in Paraguay and be punished with up to five years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill had foreseen the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence must bear on their own, if they simply furnish display and want to get a safe place to impose the state."</seg>

<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"there are two reasons for medical research being carried out on site: firstly, there are a number of medicines and vaccines that cover specific medical needs on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have severe consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"second, research carried out by African scientists is helping to develop their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>

<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa in comparison with Western countries, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often it's the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here."</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that journals can only make available for payment (the so-called Paywall) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"Rachel Cernansky's contribution was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 varieties, such as Outstanding Mouth, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many Salad varieties he can get, limits set."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents help not only for individual types, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green ton or curved leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or card varieties. because of this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia of tradition, Morton is still breeding a salad, but he now needs more, since his work is more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if in a river there would be a boulder in order to dull.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think that these patents go far too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and when they stand in front of court, nobody can breed a new kind of salad because all features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and endeavours to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the US and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">"astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salat of the variety Outstanding Mouth in the" greenhouse "of the station, where it is tested whether plants can be grown in space."</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" "Open Source" "seed) is inspired by the movement for free" open source "software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called OSSI, US breeders can commit themselves to being able to freely use the seeds bred by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open Source "growers only allow others who buy their seeds to breed it, and not immediately sow - two aspects which are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the OSSI board member, Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security as well as for environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to seed, seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">"Kloppenburg emphasizes that the" "open-source" "movement does not work with genetically modified plants."</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"food sovereignty, without sovereignty, is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to continuing their seeds at their disposal, in contrast to patenting seed and plant features."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered because the available gene pool is shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore becoming more restricted."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, director of the OSSI, has engaged in her PhD-thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all card features are protected as intellectual property, which makes it difficult for plant breeders either at all or only difficult to use."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, there are still no estimates, but experts like Luby suspect that massive grown plants such as wheat are still patented in an even larger style than lettuce or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Sight</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are bred in such a way that they have deliberately undesirable traits - from such, through which their taste or color improves, because of which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more pressing than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse predictible."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-spokeswoman Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property rights other breeders as" patents and the protection of plant varietal innovations encourage innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"thus, such protection does not inhibit innovations but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees that different: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long to breed into plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, the struggle would have been lost."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders do not have time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"overall, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant features:" we don't really create the characteristics ourselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form them themselves and as breeders, we ultimately have no idea how plants do it."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, Plant Breeders in the US state of Oregon and OSSI, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" those who breed a variety breeds its own values in it too. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures for their cultivation are needed to produce a mass of herbicides grown in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is very opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, they create most of the smaller seed companies to survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for Salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in addition, Morton believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents:" it looks like me with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I constantly need new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years themselves," he says. "with a patent one is protected 20 years ahead of competition, which makes it very easy for my opinion." worldwide response "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be a leader in the" open source "breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly across the globe."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (Centre for Sustainable Agriculture), which describes itself as a professional organization in resources, is an open source seed programme."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German Organization Agrecol works on an open source license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the OSSI obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeding are different from country to country, so the OSSI obligation cannot simply be taken one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, states that conventionally cultivated plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, Hivos organized a conference on open source seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend for patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' programme for open source seed systems, states that the organization is currently building a global alliance for" open source "seed systems for the scheduled next year of the official launch."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"an association of environmental protection and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food - is a network of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report published in this report."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also highlights the importance of a diverse, local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a connection, by the Luby of OSSI, hopes that more people will soon recognize him."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has taken particular attention to where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their foods."</seg>

<seg id="2728">"in addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada no longer exists in Egypt."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"Ziada took advantage of his blog for the spread of articles and articles, which he writes for non-accessible websites and media in Egypt."</seg>
<seg id="2730">"now the blog, which he established to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, became the target of an attack."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"blogger, the provider at which is also a resident of Canada blog, is still available."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video, as the police exercised physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mostly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the government and reflected what this meant for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"to block blogs is very old, but has been a priority in the era of Abdeldisatah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of the blog is not meaningful for the world, it is for me for two reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has been possible for them to give me the feeling of a siege, an arrest, an attempted murder, overcharging by the National Security Council, the blockage of blogs as well as any other web page for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words: my words have influence even though only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I took it to the post of articles to circumvent the censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now after they have blocked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous are going through the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this resulted in technical testing in networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"in addition, afte documented the blockage of providers, through the circumvention of internet censorship and private surfing was possible, so called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)."</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12th we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offer began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice points to the government's intention of continuing to block and filter contents to the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is also exacerbated by the fact that the censoring decisions are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which it can proceed to court against these actions."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants are fighting.</seg>

<seg id="2753">"day after day newspapers all over Brazil speak with dark news from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old at school shot," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "Diebe rushes a pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and airfield to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation in 2017, the wave of violence reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"the paper" "Extra", "known for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on 16 August, published the editorial" This is not normal "in which it announced a new section called" "War in Rio". ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explains the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sex crimes, etc. everything that happens from civilized standard and what happens in Rio will be published in the category" "War in Rio". "(...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper stated that this decision is not an event for pride but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't recognize war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial, the newspaper writes:"</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police, which first shoots and then asks questions to cover."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira, against the other hand, argues that violence as a" war. "this is in her opinion a justification of failed security policy by the media and could complicate the police to account."</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service."</seg>
<seg id="2774">"as a reminder, the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital."</seg>

<seg id="2777">"to call Rio de Janeiro as" the most violent place in Brazil, "according to Cecília," 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie in the north and northeast of the country according to statistics of 2015. these are the most recent data available. "</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"when we look at the murmons per state, Rio lays on number 16," she writes. "</seg>
<seg id="2780">"the company Globo, the largest media company in South America, is one of the largest media companies in South America, which, like Cecília, has been repeating the security policy of the state for many years."</seg>
<seg id="2781">"these security policies also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit established by the state of Rio in 2003 to capture a favela by deploying a massive police raid and permanently stationing a unit there."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases. since some years, the UPP has been increasingly under bombardment after several reports of manicans and repression against the poor communities that actually protect the newly created police unit."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page journalist João Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles from 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set by the Geneva Convention for the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war involves serious consequences for the people."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"this requires the state to use means and means typical of war. to this end, the intrusion into the territory of a" enemy, "with which a civilian is an invariable point in the landscape, and becomes an object for" collateral damage "and" distorted bullets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2787">"war back or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police climbed up the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">"in the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a fruit vendor died as a result of shots that the police had fired from a helicopter."</seg>

<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal attack and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"under Siege Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the Research Institute The Syria Institute, there are currently about one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib."</seg>

<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas have been besieged by rebels outside Damascus, which led people to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and control points."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"due to the years of blockade, traditional food such as meat has become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a counter-measure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a" life-saving food source. ""</seg>

<seg id="2810">"mushrooms do not belong to the common foods in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the director of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>

<seg id="2818">"because of fuel shortage, locally produced plastic propellants are used in order to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with the" "production of fungal seeds from the regions" "before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>
<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub. when this was successful, they used a larger tub. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">"now they have designed a" "educational farm" "for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">"since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have spread mushrooms throughout Eastern Ghouta for free."</seg>

<seg id="2833">"several hundred people protested in many districts in Portugal on October 21, and called for justice for the victims of the fires that were deposited in the north of Portugal in the week."</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government to last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Brandies were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were over 500 outbreaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest monitoring system monitored by satellite imagery in 2017 alone, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the gravity of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2848">"according to Pedrógão, roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>

<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching reform proposal brought by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was objected by the local authorities, who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law which allowed the construction activity to fall, if the applicant had funds for self-protection - that was an open back door so that everything could be built," João Grval goes on in the same article from Público. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus trees made of easily inflammable wood, like in a vicious circle, continued to spread to fires of this kind."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"these issues include the website of Portugal's Civil Defence on 15 and 16 October, seeking information or trying to contact relatives, offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: it used the own civil protection data using the fogos.pt application and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina, in order to simplify the work of the fire department and was not able to resist the rush of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits."</seg>

<seg id="2874">"two years before, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groupings that had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus, Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair."</seg>
<seg id="2875">"at that time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy, who belonged to the ethnic group of Hazara, sat in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner."</seg>

<seg id="2885">"the Taliban, known for their hate for the Hazara, came closer and closer."</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Ashara found himself in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">"for a couple of years, he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him sick."</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his little reward, and went to Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged bags with mortar that were heavier than he himself to earn his livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"at that time, like today, Afghan refugees in Iran were characterized by poverty and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharp remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, on which we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we hanged nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not froze at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharf left his life without the papers in Iran and made ready for the trip to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and landed on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time Ashara was homeless, ran through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church distributed twice a day food to aid needy."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that due to relatively high levels of awareness, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is also true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">The vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000 "special reception centres." these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel.</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially apply for asylum - which can still go for months after registration of the asylum application."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who have no money for accommodation, either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharper.</seg>
<seg id="2903">"but his unrestrained way of life helped Asharper, to liberate himself from these conditions soon."</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after several years working in the construction industry for several years, Asharf stuck his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice."</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar.</seg>

<seg id="2913">"according to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"for many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"in recent years some Afghan firms have emerged, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"in Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea for his restaurant Oriental Experience where the waiters and the staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world."</seg>
