that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times repor@@ ter .
&quot; long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the N@@ SA heard illegal teleph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA literally handed over dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter didn &apos;t like at all ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has determined against cra@@ cks and called upon him to name his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn the whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and to spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to First Am@@ end@@ ment , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they give .
&quot; so when the government collap@@ sed at Ris@@ en , he did something many courage@@ ous repor@@ ters had already done before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to jail . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en experienced the risk of going to jail . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , despite years of data that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped against cra@@ cks . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance the repor@@ ters and sources can hide themselves less and less .
&quot; instead of fail@@ ing and ris@@ king to make statements , it could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators got worried , without his agreement , his telephone calls &quot;
&quot; as well as its e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its credit information , and even travel tips with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source . &quot;
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead the ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary has more convic@@ ted than all US Govern@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has too much of its work as secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional commitment , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do this from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ spect , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software , which did not exist when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; this technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transfer system for whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now being further developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news website , such as the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; here you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government can no longer proc@@ ure information secre@@ tly , and many of the information she would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is , however , only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that thre@@ aten us all . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology separ@@ ators such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to kill mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot;
&quot; who wants to know about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and report from over@@ crowded hospitals . or the nearest environmental colleague , who strikes alarm for the contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider , who warned us of the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crime but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the biggest Daten@@ bl@@ eck of History has been published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; reveal that Rei@@ che and M@@ äch@@ tig have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we were sent by news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a little insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ el Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad has in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is claimed that a track of $ 2 billion goes to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others , who are nervous for the next release , and the next un@@ veiled documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the plot of a pupp@@ et theater or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham &apos;s novel .
&quot; it seems to be crying away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens , and not paying all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their wealth - something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function . &quot;
I always present it like a mat@@ r@@ yo@@ ff cap .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters . &quot;
I think it &apos;s also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
&quot; presum@@ ably , because there have so far been no prominent Americans who came to this sc@@ andal in these revel@@ ations . &quot;
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ el Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we would have a rec@@ t@@ angle from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections in the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is that you need less information in some US states to provide less information to found a firm than to get a library card . &quot;
this type of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off especially pr@@ one investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it actually work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 German Bar Companies in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspic@@ ious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
it really shock@@ ed us that all of us up to a lawyer made suggestions of how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients and of course nobody was given money to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; it is not about a single leader , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
&quot; this may sound very tri@@ vial as if we could not do anything about it , as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
but as bor@@ row@@ ed optim@@ ist I really see that things have started to change .
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen sur@@ pl@@ uses towards more transparency , as far as the owners of companies are concerned . &quot;
the subject took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU regi@@ sters in central regi@@ sters at national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the most unpleasant facts is that the USA is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ lines .
we need executives in the economy who stand up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot;
&quot; together we can finally finish the in@@ transparency , which now enables this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I almost kid@@ n@@ apped and landed in the boot of a red Maz@@ da . &quot;
&quot; one day after completing my design studies , I made an outlet sales . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . after that he would go to the Peace Corps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake of asking him , &quot; &quot; Where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what am I doing now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just met him ! he said he would go to the Peace Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans that . I don &apos;t want to land in the boot of a Maz@@ da ! &quot;
this is a small boot !
then I heard say : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room .
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; If , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I gaz@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what frigh@@ tened me here ? &quot;
a stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he is mad ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I got out of bed , fl@@ ashing on to@@ e tips to the door , and my bedroom door closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood , actually friends , who only waited for it to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; as I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a time jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m unemployed , almost ready , my ro@@ ommate runs out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ ommate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ etts were completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we said good@@ bye to our last guest and fell the door to the castle , Brian and I stopped . &quot;
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came to the roll .
&quot; my former ro@@ ommate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept out of it .
&quot; we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures from their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can then invite foreign people to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the ro@@ cket to ign@@ ite .
&quot; indeed , they do not . &quot;
&quot; nobody , who is still in comfort , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because as children we all have learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you don &apos;t mind the things you can do well . we could design . &quot;
at the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the total experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , among people who had never met before . &quot;
can design make something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree trust we aimed at .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I &apos;d like to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked cell phone to your left neighbour barn .
this quiet approach to panic you can feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they first open the door .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; just like that , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ? &quot;
could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidates for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the cell phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told , where did he come from , how his dog or his children were called ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he can really cling to very well un@@ locked cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you have to hand back your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system significantly boo@@ sts confidence .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to disc@@ ard negative judgments .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait until both host and guest had made their jud@@ gements before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are about age and place of residence . &quot;
&quot; not surprisingly , we trust the people most closest to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social pre@@ val@@ ence .
it will be exciting if you add a person &apos;s reputation -- in our case by assessments .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation har@@ ps com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preference .
&quot; moreover , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you talk too little , such as &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; as for example , &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal level of openness , such as &quot; Tol@@ le Art@@ work in your home ! I make holidays with my family . &quot; &quot;
how to create it with design to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our preju@@ di@@ ces towards strangers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to disc@@ ard these preju@@ di@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; third , a need previously un@@ covered . &quot;
the business is running very well for us .
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything runs smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who celebrated un@@ permitted parties or rav@@ aged apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than those calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think of it .
&quot; the dis@@ appointment , which you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller , was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million spent overnight had a problem . &quot;
for people trusted each other .
&quot; when trust works , there can be wonderful things . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
&quot; Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels , who save lives even though they don &apos;t know at all . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books over . &quot;
they leave one even longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay is running off . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions go together ?
there is an economic trade here .
&quot; but now it is simply to name &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
&quot; people lay a part of themselves open , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; when you travel today , it is easy to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what if at any place you were visiting , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one in a pub trip district , of which one has never heard ; &quot;
or if you could learn to cook from a five @-@ star cook ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would shape apartments from the ground up to one another ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of shared participation ?
I imagine cities which allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isol@@ ation@@ ism .
&quot; in South Korea capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking places belonging to the government , &quot;
were now offered to residents . students who were looking for a place to stay
&quot; were medi@@ ated to people , whose children were with@@ drawn . incub@@ ator programs were started , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host . &quot;
so the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
&quot; there was a great hospitality , too . &quot;
there were similar sites before us .
so why did our work happen ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted preju@@ di@@ ces .
&quot; I think it amaz@@ ingly , &quot;
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to pon@@ der every time a red Maz@@ da drive past me .
we know of course that design cannot solve every problem .
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this big influence , I wonder what design will soon be able to use . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are people that look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : Americans think most would not know Muslims .
presum@@ ably people don &apos;t talk to their competitors .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted
&quot; a car@@ c@@ ass @-@ fitness @-@ fan@@ atic , &quot;
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
&quot; but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born . &quot;
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old I decided to ou@@ ten me .
&quot; no , not as hom@@ os@@ exual human being , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; &quot; Why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , compared to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted passi@@ vely the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought , posed in question , doub@@ ted and believed in the end . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion which deep@@ ened itself with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to the crying .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow love ? &quot;
that is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast had breakfast , looked up on the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking message . &quot; &quot;
&quot; smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people jump@@ ed out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock quickly turned into indign@@ ation .
why should I do something like this ?
&quot; I changed the TV channel and stopped : ... &quot; Muslim terrorist &quot; ... , ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; , &quot; ... &quot; Middle ages ... , &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ji@@ had ... , ... &quot; &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it was not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to go through the US in the Middle East to move to a new city and start building post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I drove me -- when we drove sil@@ ently -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was afraid the first time to be recognised as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved to our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations that said : &quot; be alert , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Stay in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t Rec@@ eived you . &quot;
I stayed the whole week in@@ doors .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gathered to pray .
&quot; and again the warning was : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I looked at the extensive reporting .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims , or by people that were held for Muslims , distor@@ ted and sm@@ ashed . &quot;
there were really sur@@ charges for mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this land attacked our country .
I got rid of the fur@@ y of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain yourself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
they are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; today , we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot;
when will we get rid of it ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the U.S. body .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less because the question is mis@@ placed .
&quot; Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , tut@@ ors and Olympic heroes . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
&quot; there will probably be a few parking spaces , but do not stop the terror . &quot;
regular visit to a mos@@ que means to toler@@ ate people of other beliefs and to show greater public participation .
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; when the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or belief . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop the people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add to their imagination , if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot;
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x clause with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but when you take a look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality which lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pret@@ ended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was just the opposite . every cl@@ ergy that she spoke brought her to silence , and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger , she was a main target for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts , which promised her a solution . &quot;
this ima@@ m restored the connection with God and its church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed her constructive ways of a real change in the world . &quot;
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia is concerned me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
&quot; a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show that if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ it@@ arian system of government , con@@ formance and preju@@ dice . &quot;
&quot; a study shows that when individuals submit messages reported to Muslims in which negative about Muslims were reported , they were more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic issue .
&quot; if you see when the mood sw@@ ings against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot;
it can actually be a tool for manipulation the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens .
the handling of Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all . &quot;
the assignment of collective inno@@ c@@ ence is not only about having to explain themselves .
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was present at the Faculty of denti@@ stry , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man she knew . &quot;
&quot; she visited him there , and he showed her life . she was aston@@ ished and said : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when is such an accomplished young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon . &quot;
he shot on De@@ ah eight times .
&quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism may not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal . &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we staying safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave our children : one that would control us by fear or one in which we can freely practise our religion . &quot;
we decided for the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , and pulled off my shoes , and went into the hall , and what I saw let me hold . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked them and welcomed our guests , because half of the gathering were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
in that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had expressed courage and compassion pan@@ ics and preju@@ di@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
many thanks .
thank you !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what do you say to those who may claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , work in a cl@@ assy mind@@ set , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not dec@@ eive . I am completely normal . &quot;
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; if you look at Muslims all over the world , and I did that with the greatest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
&quot; so , in no way , I am an exception . &quot;
&quot; when people like an exception appear to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billion dollar business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air package delivery penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the F@@ RAC Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by joining together , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ restra@@ ined structures .
&quot; they have learned to bear loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to laws of nature . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible autonom@@ ic flight .
&quot; in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know coll@@ ectively where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room and calculate calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; external commands are available on the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter
a plane which tries to beat two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other Star@@ r@@ flü@@ g@@ ler , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most of the star@@ lings , it can fluctu@@ ate and has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a limitation of rear star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ences like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device does not matter in what position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
al@@ right .
&quot; during our research , we often face fundamental abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known for example as machines with a thousand moving parts , which join together to hurt you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled air@@ planes that had only two movable parts : one prop@@ eller and a rear ru@@ der . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flies are working with just one . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote controlled flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross ru@@ des , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside the inner life much is happening so that it can fly stable and move beyond the space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ el@@ ihood of getting it right when everyone is watching me is small , so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
&quot; as a result , it receives the proper ability , &quot;
&quot; moving in the room in all directions , no matter which direction it is filmed or even rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; a lot is imagin@@ able in models , the rest is learned directly by flying . &quot;
let &apos;s take a look at that .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ ellers .
this spins in c@@ lock@@ wise direction
and the other counter @-@ c@@ lock@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , a bit wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller comes out , the electronics or battery -- the machine can fly further even if limited . &quot;
we will now demonstrate this by making one half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we accepted custom@@ ary Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ters -- each individual weighs less than one sli@@ ce of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think of new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there would be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for guys like us , the reward lies in the development and the creative act . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to shape them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes have cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very distant galax@@ y , they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second to pure energy . &quot;
this short moment they bri@@ gh@@ tened bri@@ ghter than all stars in all galax@@ ies of the entire known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not use their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events in time .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then , the earth has produced quite a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is at us -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of especially courage@@ ous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of the Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are caused by colli@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them kept them crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognized her as a crazy genius , so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ omet@@ er- gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance . &quot;
this is why it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes pushed through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell to my death @-@ sick father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their observ@@ atories as Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a ru@@ ff@@ lement in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when moving the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and dra@@ ined into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustration , lec@@ turers often lead to a properly alpine dance in courses of rel@@ ativity . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ owed by the sur@@ ge of the waves . the elong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , one declared the Lig@@ o staff mad . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about grav@@ itation
&quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive , and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say , Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye . &quot;
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite convenient , because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light around you from several points . &quot;
&quot; in the case of sounds , this is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 metres .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean a lot to you : &quot;
about the face of your child .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain properties like pitch and height , rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , just Alice is talking . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; dum@@ b Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot create simple images of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by watching changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so if we convert Wave Pat@@ terns in sound , we can literally hear the universe . &quot;
&quot; to listen to the gravity , can tell us about the colli@@ sion of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; sh : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ ping : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two bodies very quickly , one h@@ ears the same p@@ ant@@ elop@@ es with an additional ton@@ er change . this sounds like &quot; &quot; W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date I &apos;ll never forget , Lig@@ o heard the following : the sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate approximately as fast as the rods of your sha@@ ker . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s talk briefly about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve around a hundred times per second before they colli@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
therein lies the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o is pav@@ ing an entirely new way to explore the universe as never before .
in this way we can listen to the All and the In@@ visible .
much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not see .
&quot; a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser @-@ ice stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as . &quot;
they are very useful . we learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; but the exciting physical processes occur in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never pass through since these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ g@@ low . &quot;
&quot; by means of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen before and of which we have no idea of . things we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , like Lig@@ o she ob@@ serves , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are the sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work so to speak . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o makes us a completely different point of view on the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is to be as courage@@ ous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and p@@ its of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; before which I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak in the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : just to do what I was afraid , removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear of holding speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot;
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply to an unexpected . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; cookies &quot; for un@@ expla@@ in@@ able reasons , &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ cup . &quot;
&quot; she asked me if I could play with her , when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the Beg@@ inning
&quot; a new attitude towards life in my family . from then on , I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently , I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to play with my children saved my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am a writer . I think of things , consider life . &quot;

I scre@@ am television . I produce television .
&quot; I make television , in a great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for putting together 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time . &quot;
each show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
&quot; a new episode four shows every nine days , thus every nine days 20 million dollars of television , four TV programs , 70 hours of TV , three shows : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run succ@@ essi@@ vely on Thursday evening .
all over the world my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are programmes that I have created myself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ scene . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who &apos;s doing that ?
&quot; nobody , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;

I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I tell you , that all of you who work so hard , whether you are a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously if I speak of work , so you understand that I &apos;m not just sitting on the computer and fan@@ ciful , and it &apos;s true when I say , I understand that it is not about dreams in a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , all the blood , all per@@ spir@@ ation -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; if I am deep@@ ened into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it is as I set up tro@@ ups as I paint on a canvas .
&quot; in such a way , one can make a high sound , loop a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , stren@@ uous and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cruel and rational . and the best part is the sums . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the Sum@@ ma h@@ ears like a busy street , I could go on it forever . &quot;
&quot; many people take on when I declare to them the sums , that I talk about writing that writing gives me joy . &quot;
&quot; do not understand me wrong , that does it . &quot;
&quot; but the sum -- when I started with TV production when I began working and working , building , creating and working together , I discovered this matter , this sums , this energy . &quot;
the sums are more than writing .
the Sum@@ ma is action and activity . the Sum@@ ma is a drug .
the Sum@@ ma is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the tot@@ em is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a bu@@ zz , you cannot strive for size differently . &quot;
&quot; the feeling cannot be different than striving for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the Sum@@ ma .
or perhaps it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is said genius .
maybe it &apos;s called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I only know that I did not fail to fail , and I only know that I love the bu@@ zz . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to put it into question . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more difficult boundaries , the more work there is , the more things are happening at the same time , the more I write history , the more expectations there are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz . &quot;
I like this bu@@ zz@@ ing . I love the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I need the bu@@ zz . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this sum ?
and then the sw@@ amps stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , burned out . &quot;
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are ac@@ custom@@ ed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single work of work .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
it is the children of a song .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum@@ mon ceased . &quot;
the bu@@ zz of the engine was spe@@ ech@@ less .
I didn &apos;t love my job anymore . the engine was off .
the Sum@@ ma did not come back .
my bu@@ zz@@ ing was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ day , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a showcase @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I simply had no fun any more . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
&quot; so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ ades ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think , &quot; Today &apos;s you , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do it , one loves what you are doing , being a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how the tot@@ als feels when the sum@@ ming stops , who is it ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart list@@ ens , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I am on the way to the outside , late and she says : &quot; mo@@ m , do you like playing ? &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say no when two things become aware of me :
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she called me not &quot; Cookies . &quot; &quot;
she called no one more &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; I hate it when I &apos;m Titan and my Sum@@ ma rough@@ er , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the sum , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I &apos;m quiet .
&quot; the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl returns to &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that &apos;s not right away , but it happens it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums come slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the bu@@ zz , but a bu@@ zz@@ word . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the sums , the Titan@@ ic um@@ men , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I travel through broad@@ casts and TV @-@ hours and how dys@@ functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the sums are not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sums are dependent on love .
sum@@ ming is the flow that comes from the lust for life .
the real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real sums ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be completed , anticip@@ ation and pressure . &quot;
the real hum@@ ming is simple and original .
&quot; the true Sum@@ ma is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words , for which God told me I am a titanium ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any blame as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no choice but I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
don &apos;t play it on the other way as we work .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer to work at the workplace as at home .
&quot; this admission is painful , because what a person is better working than being at home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot;
I must have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we whir@@ l around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always gri@@ pe about my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing with the games ?
you can also ! always say yes when your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you hold me for na@@ i@@ v , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? you &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a pupp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something different . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
&quot; and talking to my teen@@ age daughter for a whole fifteen minutes , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , there is no need for it . &quot;
everyone can set up 15 minutes a day even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes by the play !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no dist@@ ra@@ ction . &quot;
the day is short : dinner that makes children busy .
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . they do not have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind . &quot;
&quot; it is not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure , &quot;
&quot; to &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and store it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I desp@@ ise and I make up . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to out@@ perform myself more and more .
15 minutes a piece of why not indul@@ ge in full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the Sum@@ ma seems to return if I am not working .
working does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my bu@@ zz@@ word .
the bu@@ zz of life .
the tot@@ als of love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but only one part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
I am sle@@ u@@ ding that I am a titanium . I have never seen a titanium coming to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
&quot; and yet , I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is burning . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum . the country I create , the marathon I run , the tro@@ ups , the bu@@ ds , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the other , the right bu@@ zz : the bu@@ zz of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this Sum@@ ming , the more this unusual , lasting , naked and new feeling of life in me wide . less titanium -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sums , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am a writer . I think of things , I am stir@@ ring you to life . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thank you .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to heal itself . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability . &quot;
that is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures .
&quot; they have certainly heard of one of the most well known , the &quot; &quot; deep brain stimulation &quot; . &quot; in this process , one im@@ planted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the switching circuits of the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neurolog@@ ical function is improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson who suffered severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ cure .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we are approaching this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help itself . &quot;
history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was senior officer and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often cared for patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
&quot; they have to imagine that in case of skull @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a , the brain is oscill@@ ating and the skull pressure rises . &quot;
&quot; in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce skull pressure . &quot;
sometimes you have to remove some s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
making cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
&quot; you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it was Jean @-@ François .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked just like a stem cell culture . with big green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are imm@@ atur@@ ated cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our brain rin@@ se cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so secure .
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells . &quot;
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
this we had to prove .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did
and then mark them color @-@ like to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we re @-@ implemented them at the collection level of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re @-@ refresh these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ refresh the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with apes . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we fun@@ tioned the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we added an injury and reim@@ pl@@ emented straight the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ transplan@@ ted .
&quot; the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in the culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we could not stop here . &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity problem .
you had to take pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable skill level , we last in motor cor@@ tex the motor skills range . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it happened to people , they spontane@@ ously recovered to some degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as with the ape . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
on the left you see the monkey that spontane@@ ously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from before the injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we re @-@ refresh the cells : the same monkey , two months after implant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
&quot; since that time , we have found out a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can fre@@ eze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream still is to implant it in humans .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can take that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials on humans . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these amazing results , you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to launch clinical studies . if you continue looking into the future , how many years it takes to get to hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
&quot; after that , you have to apply this to a multic@@ entre study . &quot;
first you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it really is , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable ti@@ d@@ sm .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved that it is absolutely possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy van@@ ishes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not to affect austerity programmes that were implemented in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or Communist Party of China , or some of my so@@ ber friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if they would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to present an economic model for genuine democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group have led ast@@ ray , we could save us democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy , our societies are mur@@ der@@ ous , our future glo@@ omy , and our great new technologies are wa@@ sted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin @-@ summit @-@ parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the Scho@@ enberg mountain , who th@@ rows its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the mountain , &quot;
but only a few recognise his twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the wealthy spar@@ ers and corporations , who are too anx@@ ious to wear it , where it could be produc@@ tively and produce income with which one could wear the debt mountain and also produce all the things humanity needs , for example green energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past three months in the USA , in England and the euro area , 3.4 billion US dollars were invested in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 Bil@@ lion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until we compare it with the 5.1 tril@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay down in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock markets infl@@ ate and raise the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin tops that cannot be compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year old in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , as in an endless loop , rein@@ forces the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which would be true that his son would kill him when he is grown , &quot;
invol@@ un@@ tarily causes the circumstances to lead him to k@@ ills him .
this is my hate with capitalism --
&quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents , and specifically finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally included too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be an error to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclusi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the decisive factor in the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it embra@@ ced the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression but more important and decisive , which they grant them the right to political participation with equal voting in issues of state concerns . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t lasted long --
&quot; like a candle , which g@@ lows very bright , it is quickly burnt out . &quot;
&quot; however , our present liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies don &apos;t have their roots in ancient Athens ; &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and reinforced the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
for liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was bor@@ dered on politics while the economy -- therefore the world of corporations -- became a democracy @-@ free zone .
&quot; in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less battle between the two takes place by shifting the economy slowly and escap@@ ing it . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not up to a degeneration of its DNA .
&quot; it is because today it is possible to be in the government , and yet not in power , because the power is moved away from politics into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is about like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , which so sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ates the animals from which they are nour@@ ished , that at the end they are star@@ ving . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is with the economy that has chann@@ eled policy so far that it is self @-@ imposed by the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , the economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin tops , and the greater the extravag@@ ance of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to re@@ unite politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; re@@ tains control , as in ancient Athens , aside from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist Left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes automation the twin tops higher , the wa@@ sting , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is -- very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we must res@@ h@@ ape the economy and re@@ unite the fields of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance of surveillance , which makes the film &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; as a documentation . &quot;
so the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which he produced .
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; , &quot; in which machines serve the people and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what would it be like to have this &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; style rather than the &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies , please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and where your capital follows you from one work@@ station to the next , from one company to another , and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those currently working in the company . &quot;
then all income derived from capital and rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the enterprises , but they do not work in it , and employees working there , but no longer between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin tops . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a freely floating exchange rate in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all of humanity . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of each country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies , particularly in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes suggested in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , in particular against the background of a re@@ united policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe here is at the same time liber@@ t@@ ty in whom they prefer privileged persons , and Marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
but above all it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will aw@@ aken in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; Matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically . &quot;
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you write yourself in your biography as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we do that , technological development will produce a massive drop in macro@@ economic demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ se our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that is why I am a liberal Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am totally obli@@ vious . &quot;
&quot; BG : indeed , and now we are . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you are not enter@@ tained , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a sort of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein who said this . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have very clearly said what you think of the West &apos;s point of view . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , is the sphere of economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some ways , if I can say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
for -- remember@@ ing -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake .
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China now accused of doing what the West did in the nineteenth century itself , sm@@ ells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as a finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I know that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , to say good @-@ bye to self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the continual den@@ ial that a massive exploitation line was passed through the euro@@ zone , and continuing to massi@@ vely thre@@ aten the development of the whole of the European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , still have chosen the den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , one may be able to delay it for a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you fores@@ ee ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future unless we change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seri@@ ousness ...
&quot; if there is a Minister of Finance or any minister who after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he did not make any mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders of the don@@ or to find a common solution .
but that wasn &apos;t .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government into action , just because they did not want to deal with the crimin@@ als that ran through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they have been a disa@@ strous program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; no one from the tro@@ ika of the credi@@ tors imposed on this policy was : &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of conversations , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
&quot; for if it does not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to embar@@ k on the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 what it seems to me , it will be as det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope you &apos;ll be wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for having been at TE@@ D . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; most have never heard of Roy Price , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for so many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is senior cler@@ k at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ g and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Films , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a highly competitive industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose any one .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this corner . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the review distribution of over 2500 TV series on the website , IMDB . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review is received . &quot;
&quot; if your show is rated at nine and higher , it is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after you &apos;ve seen a season , your brain will ask , &quot; Where are there any more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price doesn &apos;t care about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to sign &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about medium output , average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t delight . &quot;
so he has to make sure he is really on the right side .
&quot; the print is available , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something like that , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he won a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where everyone can watch it free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon is free things out there , you get too , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers are watching these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are watched while watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
&quot; you can capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p or watch again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon was supposed to make a Sit@@ com via four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yeah , &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and alpha house ends at 7.5 -- something about average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always on the look@@ out to find these a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organizing a competition , he and his team have looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the ratings they give the shows , the shows they like , etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , what actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a Sit@@ com via four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator . &quot;
are you aware of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data to each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
why is that ?
because logic somehow means that it should work in everything .
&quot; when you collect millions of data , for a decision you make , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
you optimize it by very powerful computers .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work so , then this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time where we intervene more and more on statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the Multi @-@ Health Systems business here ?
&quot; nobody . OK , that &apos;s good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this space ever comes into contact with this software . come into contact with it you are in prison .
&quot; if someone is in prison here in the USA and asks for release , it is prob@@ able that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dism@@ iss@@ al is made or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it &apos;s decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moder@@ ately TV , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always generating the best results . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of sealed companies are sometimes wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that by data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the bad type , can pre@@ dict -- by analyzing data from Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked just fine , year by year , until it suddenly ceased functioning , &quot;
and nobody could tell why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data sealed companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; in spite of all these errors , data is steadily flowing into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very clever people use lots of data to make serious decisions , as the decision for cancer therapy &quot;
&quot; or the development of a drug . over the years , I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread . &quot;
&quot; you have to solve a complex problem , mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , place this problem into its parts so that you can analyse the items ; as a second , you put together the components together to make a decision . &quot;
sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and to understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for that and we all possess it : our brain .
&quot; when there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to re@@ comp@@ ose parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , which they would otherwise have not been able to do . but the decision on how to take all of these parts will put together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show which meant they took a big personal risk with this decision .
but Amazon did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when competing for TV @-@ ideas , than they chose &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; that is what the data says to us . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data is starting to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget it , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Hunter or No question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will try it out later with a tech@@ no demo .
&quot; so far I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have listened to the ball in the after@@ math . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace it with something much wis@@ er , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing , and taking risks . &quot;
&quot; because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you .
