<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA heard illegal telephones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA literally handed over drafts for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter didn't like at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has determined against cracks and called upon him to name his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn the whistleblower and to spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to First Amendment, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government collapsed at Risen, he did something many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to jail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen experienced the risk of going to jail."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, despite years of data that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped against cracks."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance the reporters and sources can hide themselves less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failing and risking to make statements, it could also do its digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators got worried, without his agreement, his telephone calls"</seg>
<seg id="21">"as well as its e-mail data, financial and bank information, its credit information, and even travel tips with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistle-blowers and Risen's supposed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead the judiciary has more convicted than all US Governments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has too much of its work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional commitment, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the government's technology allows to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do this from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software, which did not exist when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transfer system for whistle-blowers, originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now being further developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news website, such as the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"here you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer procure information secretly, and many of the information she would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"SecureDrop is, however, only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that threaten us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technology separators such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to kill misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who wants to know about grievances in the supply of soldiers and report from overcrowded hospitals. or the nearest environmental colleague, who strikes alarm for the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider, who warned us of the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crime but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the biggest Datenbleck of History has been published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that Reiche and MÃ¤chtig have hidden [enormous sums of money in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were sent by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mosbag Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a little insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mosel Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad has in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a track of $2 billion goes to Russia's President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others, who are nervous for the next release, and the next unveiled documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of a puppet theater or a John-Grisham's novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems to be crying away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens, and not paying all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"all over the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and disguise their wealth - something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens function."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it like a matryoff cap.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there have so far been no prominent Americans who came to this scandal in these revelations."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle that these tax havens function, Mosel Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we would have a rectangle from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections in the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is that you need less information in some US states to provide less information to found a firm than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off especially prone investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 German Bar Companies in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked us that all of us up to a lawyer made suggestions of how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients and of course nobody was given money to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single leader, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very trivial as if we could not do anything about it, as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">But as borrowed optimist I really see that things have started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen surpluses towards more transparency, as far as the owners of companies are concerned."</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU registers in central registers at national level, who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the most unpleasant facts is that the USA is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlines.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need executives in the economy who stand up and say: "transparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of intransparency by laws."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally finish the intransparency, which now enables this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I almost kidnapped and landed in the boot of a red Mazda."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after completing my design studies, I made an outlet sales."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. after that he would go to the Peace Corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"as we paid the bill, I made the mistake of asking him," "Where do you sleep tonight?" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I doing now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just met him! he said he would go to the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans that. I don't want to land in the boot of a Mazda!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard say: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "If, how please?" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was lying in bed, I gazed at the ceiling and thought," Oh man! what frightened me here? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is mad?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I got out of bed, flashing on toe tips to the door, and my bedroom door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood, actually friends, who only waited for it to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"as I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's take a time jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I'm unemployed, almost ready, my roommate runs out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could make something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, plus a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham-omeletts were completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them throughout the city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and fell the door to the castle, Brian and I stopped."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to the roll.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept out of it.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented to the investors:" we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures from their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can then invite foreign people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they do not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody, who is still in comfort, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you don't mind the things you can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, among people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree trust we aimed at.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked cell phone to your left neighbour barn.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet approach to panic you can feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they first open the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked cell phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just like that, who actually has Al Gores mobile phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidates for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name; if he had told, where did he come from, how his dog or his children were called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 judgements that all say: "he can really cling to very well unlocked cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you have to hand back your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-out feedback system significantly boosts confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to discard negative judgments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest had made their judgements before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are about age and place of residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"not surprisingly, we trust the people most closest to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social prevalence.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add a person's reputation -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation harps commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preference.</seg>
<seg id="186">"moreover, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you talk too little, such as" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"as for example," I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal level of openness, such as" Tolle Artwork in your home! I make holidays with my family. ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to discard these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need previously uncovered."</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is running very well for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything runs smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who celebrated unpermitted parties or ravaged apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than those calls. it hurts when I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment, which you hear in the voice of the caller, was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million spent overnight had a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, there can be wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels, who save lives even though they don't know at all."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">They leave one even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay is running off."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions go together?</seg>
<seg id="226">There is an economic trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now it is simply to name" "rental industry", "the thing is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">"people lay a part of themselves open, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel today, it is easy to compare with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place you were visiting, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one in a pub trip district, of which one has never heard;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn to cook from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would shape apartments from the ground up to one another?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities which allow us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolationism.</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking places belonging to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered to residents. students who were looking for a place to stay</seg>
<seg id="241">"were mediated to people, whose children were withdrawn. incubator programs were started,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">"there was a great hospitality, too."</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar sites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work happen?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I think it amazingly,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to ponder every time a red Mazda drive past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this big influence, I wonder what design will soon be able to use."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably people don't talk to their competitors.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Muslim, it's great to get to know you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted</seg>
<seg id="271">"a carcass-fitness-fanatic,"</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I decided to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexual human being, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friends were horrified," "Why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, compared to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted passively the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, posed in question, doubted and believed in the end."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion which deepened itself with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to the crying.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"did you ever feel that someone perceives you, you fully understand, and yet somehow love?"</seg>
<seg id="287">That is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast had breakfast, looked up on the screen and saw the word" breaking message. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical malfunction?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like this?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the TV channel and stopped:..." Muslim terrorist "...,..." in the name of Islam... ","... "Middle ages...,"... "..." "jihad...,..." "bombed Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it was not only my country being attacked, but in the Nu the deeds of others turned me into a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to go through the US in the Middle East to move to a new city and start building postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I drove me -- when we drove silently -- as deep as it went into my seat, and I was afraid the first time to be recognised as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved to our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said:" be alert, "" Be careful, "" Stay in well-lit areas, "" Don't Received you. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week indoors.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gathered to pray.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warning was:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims, or by people that were held for Muslims, distorted and smashed."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really surcharges for mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this land attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I got rid of the fury of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"today, we can actually hear people say:" there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of it? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the U.S. body.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is misplaced.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumor in the body of the United States, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, tutors and Olympic heroes."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there will probably be a few parking spaces, but do not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visit to a mosque means to tolerate people of other beliefs and to show greater public participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"when the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or belief."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add to their imagination, if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clause with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when you take a look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" Holy Scripture. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality which lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was just the opposite. every clergy that she spoke brought her to silence, and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger, she was a main target for the instrumentalization of extremists, which promised her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam restored the connection with God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed her constructive ways of a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia is concerned me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">"a study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show that if we fear, at least three things happen."</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian system of government, conformance and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows that when individuals submit messages reported to Muslims in which negative about Muslims were reported, they were more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic issue.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you see when the mood swings against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for manipulation the public to undermine the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">The assignment of collective innocence is not only about having to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school."</seg>

<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous man she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">"she visited him there, and he showed her life. she was astonished and said:"</seg>

<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon."</seg>

<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we staying safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave our children: one that would control us by fear or one in which we can freely practise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, and pulled off my shoes, and went into the hall, and what I saw let me hold."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked them and welcomed our guests, because half of the gathering were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had expressed courage and compassion panics and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air package delivery penetrated into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by joining together, flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in confined spaces."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-restrained structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to bear loads, deal with turbulence and generally respond to laws of nature."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the possible autonomic flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to work autonomously, it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room."</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room and calculate calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available on the highest level, e.g." "Start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter</seg>
<seg id="422">A plane which tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other StarrflÃ¼gler, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most of the starlings, it can fluctuate and has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear starters is that they are sensitive to turbulences like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight device does not matter in what position the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Alright.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often face fundamental abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known for example as machines with a thousand moving parts, which join together to hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled airplanes that had only two movable parts: one propeller and a rear ruder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flies are working with just one."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically simple remote controlled flight device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and cross rudes, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, inside the inner life much is happening so that it can fly stable and move beyond the space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood of getting it right when everyone is watching me is small, so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in cruelty, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, it receives the proper ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in the room in all directions, no matter which direction it is filmed or even rotated."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"a lot is imaginable in models, the rest is learned directly by flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's take a look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This spins in clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counter-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, a bit wrong -- a motor or propeller comes out, the electronics or battery -- the machine can fly further even if limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making one half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We accepted customary Micro-Quadcopters -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think of new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine there would be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">"for guys like us, the reward lies in the development and the creative act."</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to shape them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>

<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes have circled each other in a very distant galaxy, they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second to pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they brightened brighter than all stars in all galaxies of the entire known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not use their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">"1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life was created on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then, the earth has produced quite a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is at us -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of especially courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of the Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, which are caused by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them kept them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people recognized her as a crazy genius, so that the US National Science Foundation financed her idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser-interferometer- gravitational-wave observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the follow-up period, the precision of ligo could be significantly increased, which greatly improved the recognition performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">This is why it is now called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes pushed through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes and their observatories as Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a rufflement in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when moving the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and drained into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustration, lecturers often lead to a properly alpine dance in courses of relativity."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and stowed by the surge of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this means 20 zeros after comma, followed by a 1. therefore, one declared the Ligo staff mad."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre-long laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousandth of the radius of a nuclear nucleus. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive, and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to Ligo. Scott likes to say, Ligo is more an ear than an eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite convenient, because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light around you from several points."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in the case of sounds, this is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 metres.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean a lot to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain properties like pitch and height, rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just Alice is talking."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dumb Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot create simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by watching changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so if we convert Wave Patterns in sound, we can literally hear the universe."</seg>
<seg id="522">"to listen to the gravity, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"sh: two black, non-rotating holes, chirping: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turn the two bodies very quickly, one hears the same pantelopes with an additional toner change. this sounds like" "Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu". ""</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date I'll never forget, Ligo heard the following: the sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate approximately as fast as the rods of your shaker."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's talk briefly about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve around a hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo is paving an entirely new way to explore the universe as never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">In this way we can listen to the All and the Invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why masser-ice stars explode in super-novas."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but the exciting physical processes occur in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the Big Bang is covered by its own afterglow."</seg>
<seg id="541">"by means of gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen before and of which we have no idea of. things we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, like Ligo she observes, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the saurierknochen for our archaeological work so to speak."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo makes us a completely different point of view on the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and pits of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>

<seg id="562">"no, no, no, yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: just to do what I was afraid, removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear of holding speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "yes" "has changed my life."</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "yes" "changed me."</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply to an unexpected. it began with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" cookies "for unexplainable reasons,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak-cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked me if I could play with her, when I was on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the Beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"a new attitude towards life in my family. from then on, I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, on our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an amazing side effect: only recently, I fully understood that the" "Yes" "to play with my children saved my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am a writer. I think of things, consider life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Lightweight (4-12Kb)</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Lightweight (4-12Kb)</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in a great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for putting together 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">We say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode four shows every nine days, thus every nine days 20 million dollars of television, four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run successively on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are programmes that I have created myself, and not only produced, so still obscene. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who's doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">"nobody, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Lightweight (4-12Kb)</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with that.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think if the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you, that all of you who work so hard, whether you are a company, a country or a classroom, take me seriously if I speak of work, so you understand that I'm not just sitting on the computer and fanciful, and it's true when I say, I understand that it is not about dreams in a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, everything reality, all the blood, all perspiration -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"if I am deepened into the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as I set up troups as I paint on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">"in such a way, one can make a high sound, loop a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like BeyoncÃ©.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, strenuous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and motherly, cruel and rational. and the best part is the sums."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the Summa hears like a busy street, I could go on it forever."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people take on when I declare to them the sums, that I talk about writing that writing gives me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"do not understand me wrong, that does it."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sum -- when I started with TV production when I began working and working, building, creating and working together, I discovered this matter, this sums, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The Summa is action and activity. the Summa is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Summa is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The totem is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a buzz, you cannot strive for size differently."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling cannot be different than striving for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the Summa.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is said genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I only know that I did not fail to fail, and I only know that I love the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to put it into question."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more successful I become, the more broadcasts, the more difficult boundaries, the more work there is, the more things are happening at the same time, the more I write history, the more expectations there are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzzing. I love the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the swamps stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overloaded, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single work of work.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mum will not be there, but you can write to my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a song.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the summon ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The Summa did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzzing was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-day, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a titanium does not sleep, does not give up, with full heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a showcase-Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I simply had no fun any more."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do when what you do, the work you love, suddenly fades?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think," Today's you, stupid author-Titan. ""</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you do it, one loves what you are doing, being a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, and knows how the totals feels when the summing stops, who is it?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart listens, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way to the outside, late and she says:" mom, do you like playing? "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say no when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she called me not" Cookies. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She called no one more "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I hate it when I'm Titan and my Summa rougher, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mama, do you like to play?" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in solitude and in the absence of the sum, I can't do anything except to watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I'm quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl returns to" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that's not right away, but it happens it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the buzz, but a buzzword."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the sums, the Titanic ummen, this is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I travel through broadcasts and TV-hours and how dysfunctional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums are not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums are dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">Summing is the flow that comes from the lust for life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be completed, anticipation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real humming is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the true Summa is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words, for which God told me I am a titanium?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any blame as a workaholic."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice but I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Don't play it on the other way as we work.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this admission is painful, because what a person is better working than being at home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" "Titan" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I must have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we whirl around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always gripe about my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sum of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! always say yes when your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you hold me for naiv, for a daydreamer."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you are right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you're not Rihanna or a puppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and talking to my teenage daughter for a whole fifteen minutes, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, there is no need for it."</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can set up 15 minutes a day even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes by the play!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner that makes children busy.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. they do not have to be the children. it is important to feel the humming, to have a place for peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it is not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure,"</seg>
<seg id="759">"to" "play" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I despise and I make up. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">Want to play? "is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training when I wanted to outperform myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece of why not indulge in full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the Summa seems to return if I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the buzz, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sum, the sum is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my buzzword.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The totals of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of the work is part of me, but only one part. and I am so grateful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">I am sleuding that I am a titanium. I have never seen a titanium coming to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">"and yet, I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfire is burning."</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the more clear my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sum. the country I create, the marathon I run, the troups, the buds, the buzz, the buzz, the other, the right buzz: the buzz of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this Summing, the more this unusual, lasting, naked and new feeling of life in me wide. less titanium -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel this sums, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am a writer. I think of things, I am stirring you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is part of the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a bit dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "Yes" "to less work and more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to heal itself."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they have certainly heard of one of the most well known, the" "deep brain stimulation". "in this process, one implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the switching circuits of the neurons in such a way that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson who suffered severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean neuro-cure.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we are approaching this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help itself."</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was senior officer and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often cared for patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">"they have to imagine that in case of skull-brain traumata, the brain is oscillating and the skull pressure rises."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, it is necessary to reduce skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove some swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-FranÃ§ois Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Making cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it was Jean-FranÃ§ois.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked just like a stem cell culture. with big green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are immaturated cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our brain rinse cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">This we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-FranÃ§ois did</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them color-like to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we re-implemented them at the collection level of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we re-refresh these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we re-refresh the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we funtioned the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and reimplemented straight the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-transplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells that we dye in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we could not stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity problem.</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable skill level, we last in motor cortex the motor skills range."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it happened to people, they spontaneously recovered to some degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just as with the ape."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey that spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from before the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, when we re-refresh the cells: the same monkey, two months after implantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found out a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to implant it in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" I know someone who can take that. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials on humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these amazing results, you have to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to launch clinical studies. if you continue looking into the future, how many years it takes to get to hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply this to a multicentre study."</seg>
<seg id="897">First you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it really is, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable tidsm.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved that it is absolutely possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy vanishes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not to affect austerity programmes that were implemented in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment, I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or Communist Party of China, or some of my sober friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished if they would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to present an economic model for genuine democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup have led astray, we could save us democracy, but that we need a true and defenseless democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy, our societies are murderous, our future gloomy, and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of extravagance, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin-summit-paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the Schoenberg mountain, who throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognise his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy sparers and corporations, who are too anxious to wear it, where it could be productively and produce income with which one could wear the debt mountain and also produce all the things humanity needs, for example green energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past three months in the USA, in England and the euro area, 3.4 billion US dollars were invested in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 Billion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until we compare it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time lay down in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock markets inflate and raise the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital form the twin tops that cannot be compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year old in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, as in an endless loop, reinforces the pessimism of investors, which would be true that his son would kill him when he is grown,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily causes the circumstances to lead him to kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hate with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents, and specifically finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally included too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be an error to reduce the significance of the Athenian democracy due to these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive factor in the athenian democracy was and is that it embraced the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression but more important and decisive, which they grant them the right to political participation with equal voting in issues of state concerns."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy hasn't lasted long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which glows very bright, it is quickly burnt out."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our present liberal democracies don't have their roots in ancient Athens;"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and reinforced the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">For liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was bordered on politics while the economy -- therefore the world of corporations -- became a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">"in today's democracies, since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless battle between the two takes place by shifting the economy slowly and escaping it."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not up to a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because today it is possible to be in the government, and yet not in power, because the power is moved away from politics into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is about like a herd of carnivores, which so sustainably decimates the animals from which they are nourished, that at the end they are starving."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is with the economy that has channeled policy so far that it is self-imposed by the self-created economic crisis. the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, the economic demand falls, and the managing directors of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism distributes the" demos "from democracy, the higher the twin tops, and the greater the extravagance of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we have to reunite politics and the economy, and it would be better if the" Demos "retains control, as in ancient Athens, aside from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes automation the twin tops higher, the wasting, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is -- very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we must reshape the economy and reunite the fields of economy and politics, and make sure that we are democratizing the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance of surveillance, which makes the film" "Matrix" "as a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which he produced.</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in" "Matrix", "in which machines serve the people and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long talks the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what would it be like to have this" "Star Trek" "style rather than the" "Matrix" "similar dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies, please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and where your capital follows you from one workstation to the next, from one company to another, and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income derived from capital and redeeming and the concept of wage labour is completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the enterprises, but they do not work in it, and employees working there, but no longer between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin tops."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a freely floating exchange rate in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"furthermore, imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- call it" the cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos "-- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of each country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies, particularly in parts of the world where investment funds are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, in particular against the background of a reunited policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe here is at the same time libertty in whom they prefer privileged persons, and Marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash bin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "Matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better democratically."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You write yourself in your biography as a libertarian Marxist.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I just said is relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... do we do that, technological development will produce a massive drop in macroeconomic demand, which is called Larry Summers as" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we currently experience, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is correct, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"like Hayek, that is why I am a liberal Marxist, and as Keynes, and that's why I am totally oblivious."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: indeed, and now we are."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you are not entertained, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a sort of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you have very clearly said what you think of the West's point of view."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my talk, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays, is the sphere of economy -- a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some ways, if I can say so provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remembering -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China now accused of doing what the West did in the nineteenth century itself, smells of hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as a finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I know that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, to say good-bye to self-complacency, and the continual denial that a massive exploitation line was passed through the eurozone, and continuing to massively threaten the development of the whole of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately the powers within the eurozone, within the Euro Group, still have chosen the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism in life, one may be able to delay it for a while, but if the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you foresee?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future unless we change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a Minister of Finance or any minister who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he did not make any mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the lenders of the donor to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that wasn't.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they merely wanted to bring our government into action, just because they did not want to deal with the criminals that ran through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they have been a disastrous program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"no one from the troika of the creditors imposed on this policy was:" "that was a colossal mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of conversations, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if it does not survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to embark on the path of a post-modern 1930 what it seems to me, it will be as detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans."</seg>

<seg id="1038">"most have never heard of Roy Price, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for so many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is senior clerk at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog and describes himself on Twitter as" Films, TV, Technique, Tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a highly competitive industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this corner."</seg>
<seg id="1049">"this curve is the review distribution of over 2500 TV series on the website, IMDB. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review is received."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is rated at nine and higher, it is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive, where, after you've seen a season, your brain will ask," Where are there any more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price doesn't care about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to sign" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about medium output, average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't delight."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the print is available, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something like that, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he won a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where everyone can watch it free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon is free things out there, you get too, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are watched while watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you can capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skip or watch again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon was supposed to make a Sitcom via four republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yeah," "Alpha House", "but it seems that not many remember this show because it wasn't so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 and alpha house ends at 7.5 -- something about average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always on the lookout to find these a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organizing a competition, he and his team have looked at the available data on the Netflix audience, so the ratings they give the shows, the shows they like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use these data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, what producers, what actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a Sitcom via four Senators, but a drama series about a Senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Are you aware of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data to each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow means that it should work in everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"when you collect millions of data, for a decision you make, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work so, then this is a bit scary because we live in a time where we intervene more and more on statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the Multi-Health Systems business here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"nobody. OK, that's good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this space ever comes into contact with this software. come into contact with it you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison here in the USA and asks for release, it is probable that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is made or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it's decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderately TV, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always generating the best results. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of sealed companies are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that by data analysis outbreaks of flu, the bad type, can predict -- by analyzing data from Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked just fine, year by year, until it suddenly ceased functioning,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could tell why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sealed companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"in spite of all these errors, data is steadily flowing into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people use lots of data to make serious decisions, as the decision for cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">"or the development of a drug. over the years, I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread."</seg>
<seg id="1110">"you have to solve a complex problem, mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, place this problem into its parts so that you can analyse the items; as a second, you put together the components together to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and to understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for that and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"when there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to recompose parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, which they would otherwise have not been able to do. but the decision on how to take all of these parts will put together again and make a show like" House of Cards, "that was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show which meant they took a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">But Amazon did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when competing for TV-ideas, than they chose" "Alpha House" "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" that is what the data says to us. "</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data is starting to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget it, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a Hunter or No question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will try it out later with a techno demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far I have made some decisions in my life, and I should have listened to the ball in the aftermath."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace it with something much wiser, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you are doing, and taking risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you.</seg>
