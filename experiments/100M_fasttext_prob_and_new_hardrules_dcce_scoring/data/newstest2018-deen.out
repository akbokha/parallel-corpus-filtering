Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt where young people are supposed to meet today .
a chapel that is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the former ground of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories about days .
it anno@@ ys if maps are not up to date .
everybody knows everybody who had to get up@@ set because the car na@@ v was showing a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ opoli@@ s Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but current - but very enligh@@ tening . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that is not recognized immediately .
&quot; the large overview card was drawn up for towns and communities with more detailed maps , so called &quot; &quot; Ur@@ ination leaves &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these were created according to the Bavarian surve@@ ying administration between 18@@ 10 and 1864 , and the first surve@@ ying was Bay@@ erns . &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon desired an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops ended up with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 : it was today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavarian map . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph pushed the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian surve@@ ying management . &quot;
the certificate of composition for Munich originates from the year 18@@ 56 and is to be found like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
&quot; the comparison of former / today , in the example of the state capital , is most impressive . &quot;
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ send@@ ling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
&quot; Send@@ ling was incorporated 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 1877 , in the district of Munich . &quot;
today Unter@@ send@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ ling are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was first named after 1878 after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the Bavarian peasant rebellion against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , nothing can be seen as fields - at first glance : in the zoom zoom a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered bottles from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ sus &quot; from which the land was derived . &quot;
&quot; small plots no longer show farmers there , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; plant . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 arena of the October test , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the area of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen area , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; or from the address &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once locked people with ma@@ dness . &quot;
&quot; there was the district &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 . &quot;
&quot; in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den headed up the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the charges of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; he also for@@ bi@@ ds the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients , there was first place , later it was expanded to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts . &quot;
at the site of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt young people now meet in Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training establishments .
&quot; the football field of the TS@@ V München east is located west , east residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; was erected in architectural references to the country of origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during World War II in bom@@ bing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the shopping destination was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change also in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies broke out many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a large remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once on the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days were prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof . &quot;
citizen Rights Group publishes Travel War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for Col@@ oring Far@@ ming has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ amer@@ ican travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to take special attention while travelling through the state and be noted here , &quot; said the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people harder to win discrimination complaints , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , disp@@ ro@@ portion@@ ate to minorities , promp@@ ted the group to publish the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , which happen to people . &quot;
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard .
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no gasoline anymore while travelling by the state and taken into custo@@ dy by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also pointed out to a recently published report by the Gover@@ nor General of Mis@@ sour@@ i , in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff what might happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; Chapel said . &quot;
people must be prepared to bring cow@@ rie money or let relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i posted 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the F@@ BI &apos;s crime series reporting program , which ranks the state with respect to the number of such violations of the 16th position of the country . &quot;
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warning for Texas and Arizona after the states agreed to arrest the local prosecution authorities to arrest people for immigration rules , which will contribute to the view of AC@@ L@@ U on further road profile . &quot;
&quot; travel warning is usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
Wei@@ de@@ za@@ un@@ projekt is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ men Wei@@ dec@@ au@@ n Project is a successful project and will be continued next year .
the members of the CD@@ U member Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac provided a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the right @-@ grab@@ bing court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fischer@@ bach CD@@ U @-@ Orts@@ verband , together with mayor Thomas Schneider , met with the two dep@@ u@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insight into his farm , in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals , and accommod@@ ated in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black @-@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milk &quot; &quot; is for him an alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste comes exclusively regional .
&quot; since he is also a BL@@ HV chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he called the Wei@@ de@@ za@@ un@@ projekt as &quot; elementary . &quot; &quot;
I cannot work profitable on such steep surfaces .
&quot; green land care for a lot of work , a lot must be worked with the brus@@ h@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography here , &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ ser , even if he did not conduct a bio@@ economy . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leadership . &quot;
farmers should be supported at cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are .
I hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the areas could be extended for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they continue their operations , &quot; the mayor stressed . &quot;
farmers stand in cri@@ tiques because of the encour@@ agement
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 via the electric fence .
&quot; this covers 40 hectares , which must not be en@@ for@@ ested until at least 2023 . &quot;
&quot; half of the total costs in the amount of 71 500 Euros were funded by leaders , a quarter carried the municipality of Fischer@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers remained 12 610 Euro , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of pasture fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac said : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job without farmers and rural women . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter Weiss : &quot; &quot; best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landscape preservation line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state promotion of pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the goal is to maintain the Black Forest .
the prerequisite is the presence of a conveying environment designated by the L@@ PR .
&quot; in addition , the enclosed area may not be min@@ tu@@ de@@ able ( slope gra@@ dient of 35 percent ) and must thus be threatened by the re@@ for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the 2018 fisher@@ man &apos;s Wei@@ de@@ za@@ un@@ projekt 2018 the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the maintenance area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans value this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals to dras@@ tically limit legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to be fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ Im@@ it@@ ators would have pun@@ ched him if he had done it .
&quot; but he touched its significance , and in particular the meaning it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
the poem you refer to was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is properly speaking , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the angry words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your rub@@ b@@ ish , your poor , / your afflic@@ ted masses , who y@@ earn to breathe freely , the wa@@ iling drop of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; el@@ ent waste &quot; was better seen on our screens .
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in the USA .
this conflict on the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural dispute : it is in fact a conflict around the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place their words on the basis of their death at the base - knew very well that they took a high political action .
&quot; the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ anism , portra@@ ying female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical illustration . &quot;
&quot; Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract , she has received a voice . &quot;
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devast@@ ating attack on American n@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just like Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great cry of R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty is no one , but rather an early Ne@@ oc@@ on , bringing the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is proceeding . &quot;
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the torch should not light the way into the United States .
&quot; quite unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh is found here on something . &quot;
the meaning of the statue is completely and even a question of the point of perception of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , mis@@ erable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to acknowledge .
&quot; their torch should not light the way , but ign@@ ite hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ dges Scottish members of the Great Britain team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team
&quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , states that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the World Championships &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday . &quot;
black believes that &quot; something special is developed in Scotland &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue to figure it out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that there is something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are Med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ acker - who will compete against Sir Mon Far@@ ah at the 5,000 m distance while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team to the team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought , of course , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver medal winner , who will compete with her fifth world champion@@ ships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , states that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes in the World Championship was seven in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads along this road and has installed five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part at the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1.500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to watch the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games after a great season . &quot;
Do@@ yle is remember@@ ing her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell team .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases they will also be involved in medals and fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ates voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb up on platforms . &quot;
what concerns my speech as captain ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
&quot; I have only indicated that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship . &quot;
it is therefore really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympi@@ asta@@ dion .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there .
block@@ age of Cri@@ tics via Facebook : don &apos;t work for a public office if you can &apos;t toler@@ ate the n@@ atives of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything from the domestic policy to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sh@@ ou@@ ted with criticism , surely . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid , and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who has to work to be more like Washington .
&quot; Ho@@ gans &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people , who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page . &quot;
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismis@@ sed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; &quot; Na &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary sky@@ head .
he has demonstrated a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to play bac@@ kl@@ ash his ha@@ iry head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side , which is a public forum that is designated as official and by employees paid with public tax dollars , is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , the spokes@@ woman A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse praised the governor &apos;s actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ ass@@ filled people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the mail addressed with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are only real people speaking with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur , and a pastor , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not profound . &quot;
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans &apos;s Catholic faith .
&quot; attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not stu@@ ffed , but she asked for hate crime . &quot;
&quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the comment section of &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a stand on the same subject , they are considered by some rather than a so @-@ called collective employment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the Gover@@ nor of the Gover@@ nor designated as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or removing a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if one would have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical lo@@ aders and to arrest and silence the demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
but this is exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County passed the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to US District Jud@@ ges James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at Washington &apos;s time , the time of affordable port@@ ol@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lies between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter writer kno@@ cked on his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; people who used pseud@@ ony@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions that critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his ministry , according to historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not give them silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true guidance means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European No 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an organized the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year in the Arch@@ er@@ field left to En@@ dr@@ unde , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador for the name of the association founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job as he established that place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the English E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although in his 32 @-@ year career he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels very special , &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year , after I won them . &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who , after his 50@@ th birthday , came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year , returns to the action on the home floor . &quot;
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m glad about how it went .
&quot; the former Masters champion Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
the entrance is free of charge ; the parking lot is £ 5 per car with an occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers .
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less canc@@ ers due to passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking . &quot;
researchers at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) came to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking per year , &quot; said senior lecturer Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; at that time , there were also 400 canc@@ ers of lung cancer due to passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; construction work in the Vill@@ ingen Road is in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; says Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected as there is a lot of vineyards in the underground , which is not noted in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which repeat@@ ed@@ ely ob@@ stru@@ cts construction work , represents a major problem for the B@@ aut@@ um@@ pp company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and shut@@ ters is already enormous , &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular bus@@ ses are eligible for passage .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but fortunately we were looked after by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold Land
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai regim@@ en in the rest@@ less Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually speci@@ fies a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the char@@ red an@@ ol@@ le is removed and dev@@ oured with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands . &quot;
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work such as dresses with water from the nearby mar@@ sh .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is custom@@ ary here .
&quot; of course it can be dangerous to work late : most villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many are heavy drinking , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5 pm , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 El@@ ders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up independence against the Dutch regime , quickly turned against the Jak@@ arta government , which maintains the control of the region and ex@@ cludes foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and Western Pap@@ ua , and the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ er@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as ö@@ de is . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 hour drive with car rental .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo @-@ f@@ ences and made of corrugated boxes , which were converted into different yellow @-@ brown tones by r@@ ust . &quot;
&quot; very few Indonesian have made their trip here , let journalists and practically no foreig@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honored a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not ac@@ custom@@ ed to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst children mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort completed gold and copper valued at $ 3.1 billion . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources valued at $ 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; these fortun@@ es , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has preserved a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; a study of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ uan demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to the activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military . &quot;
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal country in the 1970 @-@ s were considered to be genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful prot@@ esters last year . &quot;
&quot; we Mak@@ ing Every@@ thing &quot; is said in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electro@@ sur@@ charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents occur , &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
bolts have intensi@@ fied because Pap@@ u@@ as resources produce a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % of Christian , but demographic development changes because Muslim economic migrants are coming from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ anese war@@ ping cant@@ e@@ ens sell roasted chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served . &quot;
local people are struggling to keep up here .
&quot; migrants began to sell ch@@ ick@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local , who moved to the province capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it cost the native Pap@@ ua - Mama @-@ M@@ om &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua , their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised the ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his campaign in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua there is little change , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that it will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 kids was outdoors and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn off their spot@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took an imp@@ etus to their sound and later returned to four soldiers , such as the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers , who had drunk , ch@@ ased and sm@@ ashed the group with their ri@@ fle but@@ t , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so heavily beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set alight and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a football ground in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice . &quot;
they carried the cerem@@ onial hunting ground and carried the Wa@@ ita dance - continuously in the circle and mim@@ icking a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some prot@@ esters began to drag stones to police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it is said in an official TI@@ ME document that has not been released by local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego Kot@@ o neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who , like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , bears only a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy atmosphere . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told repor@@ ters that his officers only wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people are threatening to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more wounded . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came only the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Minister of Security , Wir@@ anto , said that he set out an out @-@ of @-@ court mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that need to be tra@@ vers@@ ed , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
then Wir@@ anto gave a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; instead , &quot; everything is governed by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto , accused of &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody declaration of independence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been buried in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such alleg@@ ations with a gri@@ mm@@ ing un@@ beli@@ ever .
&quot; I have been inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military looked for me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings did not stop .
&quot; on Tuesday , the Indonesian police shot on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring an un@@ conscious man to hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he conf@@ isc@@ ated in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
disturbed villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded to them by fir@@ ing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indonesian par@@ am@@ ilit@@ ary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were delivered quickly , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon to take account of the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ gade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an im@@ memorial of the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal people Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , cla@@ iming to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by spur@@ ting spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kid@@ n@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders are from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ die Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily arrested in custo@@ dy , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never dive again .
&quot; among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten village . &quot; &quot;
poverty alle@@ vi@@ ates dis@@ content .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ car@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : mainly Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new routes to Nab@@ ire Airport . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region generally address the better educated and weal@@ thier migrants .
they rarely have capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own companies .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on the coverage of international media are ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported to Pap@@ ua because of lack of coordination with related institutions , although their rare permission to film was given to them . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the deputy head of Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign to raise the restrictions on reporting in order to promote transparency and development is not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s most east@@ ern@@ most provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and black@@ list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government largely remains confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six paci@@ fic states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r dismis@@ sed the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human right Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , n@@ atives jour@@ ne@@ yed and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source which also participated in the session but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 but the Pap@@ ua states that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is located in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; that he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai fir@@ esters led a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ p@@ se of an victim was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they may never give justice to them , but at least they will not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of inhabitants to escape from the 337 m high , 79 @-@ story buildings . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( Tor@@ ch Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the sh@@ outs of the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; &quot; told a resident who attacked his name as George , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units at 4.00 hrs local time ( 0@@ 0.00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled the building .
the government said it is working on providing accommodation to those affected .
&quot; the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials , which are used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damage from the covering , the outer casing for decoration or insulation came . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and disgu@@ ising at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through with his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
&quot; at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal for this sport was to play Davis Cup single only on two swe@@ ep@@ stak@@ es , thin@@ ly not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but even so much appreciated five @-@ set classics remain the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of the member states voted for reform , the goal of IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore scar@@ cely missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members do not have accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; after many sa@@ y@@ ings , not only for the vote , the proposal had already been made to cast the final on a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively small details : in future , the fin@@ alists will be the host @-@ right for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the next year in the next round . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce costs for the organizers , the requirements in terms of training positions etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers brings forbidden objects to the aircraft , finding a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by airline passengers revealed that more than 20 per cent deliberately or un@@ consciously prohibited items acc@@ ru@@ ed to the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 per cent , which entered the aircraft while acci@@ dentally worn out knives or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed they had bel@@ at@@ edly discovered that they were mistakenly charged with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey for more than 1,000 people , which was conducted by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also stated that younger travelers more likely ignore the rules . &quot;
&quot; those sur@@ vey@@ ed who admitted they have know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was prohibited by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent of the Millennium , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the X generation . &quot;
the most common items that were inten@@ tionally passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the company said it questioned travelers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ gling goods would have brought by airport security and how many had done it inten@@ tionally .
&quot; it is no surprise that the people who are most sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who most often fly . &quot;
&quot; however , the company suggests that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure which liquids can take them or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest quantity of objects conf@@ isc@@ ated by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought that T@@ SA could see books as sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; fluids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k it doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to deal with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
he has so far under@@ min@@ ed that some of the customers have already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding booking .
&quot; in addition to the constantly triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k announced for the first time another , less brilliant figure : the cancell@@ ations made at the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k has frequently adverti@@ sed more than 500,000 orders for the new car , whose delivery straight begins . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k admitted : from the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 orders , 6@@ 3,000 have already been with@@ drawn . &quot;
critics have always pointed out that only non @-@ binding reservations are concerned .
&quot; during a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 45@@ 5.000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are taking place in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , Tes@@ la chief does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot;
his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side .
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; 2018 - all models are to be combined - 500,000 be one million by 2020 . &quot;
the demand for this is obviously there .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
&quot; who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today , may anticip@@ ate delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new , unprecedented production roads without major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to major delays , the non @-@ binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from exp@@ elling in dro@@ ves . &quot;
EPA leader P@@ ru@@ itt is moving back to reducing emissions due to the delay in the Obama Er@@ a rules
&quot; one day after he was su@@ ed from 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the environmental protection authority , res@@ or@@ ted his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollut@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as his agency proved to be respon@@ sive to the needs of state environmental authorities , compared to previous administr@@ ations . &quot;
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ als .
it is about a deadline that ran for states on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for O@@ zone .
&quot; P@@ ru@@ ten announced in June that he will delay compliance with a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfere in local decisions , or to interfere with economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump At@@ tor@@ ney of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of tough@@ er environmental protection regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ ten has repeatedly been repe@@ aled to block or delay regulations that resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ dent &apos;s regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Washington Federal Court ruled that the EPA Administrator has exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ an@@ lec@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply increased the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with the dead@@ lines for implementation and then been accused of being accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , and agreed in an agreement to determine the date for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who def@@ ends the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and authority that gives us serious .
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; power to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; to ensure that the regulations are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress push for a broader re @-@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
&quot; the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the states that had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the Group intends to maintain statutory pressure . &quot;
&quot; revers@@ ing the EPA - according to our deposits - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; Schnei@@ der@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; in this case New York joined California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;

representatives of the public health care system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered for a surprising change of course .
&quot; it is troub@@ ling how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot;
we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to join the environment poll@@ ers and their particular interests .
tum@@ ors Celeb@@ rates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the parish church , the old cemetery are@@ al in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 pm was invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius complex is a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters of the tumor to their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village small treasure . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ische year@@ book : &quot; &quot; Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Abbey &quot; &quot; to Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the pro@@ clamation of the certificate , on the hill , besides the former parish church , there was also a marvellous court , to which the church or patron is owned and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , alongside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible in the village image of tur@@ rets , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement centre of the village . &quot;
old maps dating back to 1600 are under@@ lining the historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age was originated from the early medieval self @-@ church law .
&quot; a gent@@ leman who built a church and occupied with a pastor , remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church . &quot;
&quot; associated with this , the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop . &quot;
three alt@@ ars existed in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger of the two crum@@ bled at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later had to be released in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops were enc@@ amped near the church .
&quot; they took out the pul@@ pit and the church @-@ chairs , and used them as fire@@ wood . &quot;
rem@@ n@@ ants of the church threatened to crash in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 1869 , the Tum@@ or Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead in Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the church was demoli@@ shed .
only the bell tower was left standing .
in the New Year &apos;s night in 18@@ 34 a storm spl@@ itted the steep@@ le and half pl@@ ung@@ ed .
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; only the tower , which is still existing today , remained a witness to the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history . &quot;
&quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em care about the &quot; &quot; creative reti@@ re@@ es &quot; &quot; as successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; as a promot@@ er , the friends and promot@@ ers invite tum@@ ours on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade from the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is designed by the Combo of Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
&quot; Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann , speaks the closing word . &quot;
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission starts at 3 : 30 p.m .
&quot; to the end of the Ser@@ en@@ ade , there is a trunk in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; the organizers take the fantastic view . &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius complex , which is of significance for tum@@ ors and radio @-@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
the friends and supporters of the Tum@@ our are particularly committed to the care of home care such as Ser@@ en@@ ade Organ@@ izer Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to permit the approval of wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; does not see a legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the country council .
&quot; the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim , &quot; has called on Board of Directors Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind force concentration zone at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; in this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy utilization for the remaining city area . &quot;
such zones are meant to prevent &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier , but the district government of Dus@@ sel@@ dorf had not approved it because of a lack of form . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the approval of approval is still un@@ lawful and therefore to take back , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , who is the president of Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break the municipal council again resolved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; approval of the district government is still pending .
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; at this point , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind energy systems is not legally ruled out . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been received by Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; declared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes them to test the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning to build four each 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area of the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer there was a green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch Wind@@ park near Aachen as well as an investment in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg District .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was wounded k@@ ingly .
two more persons were slightly injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
&quot; according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch , with her passenger car , drove the L 333 in direction to Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion . &quot;
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za and people from the region are to discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on September 8th and 9th in order to l@@ ure the inhabitants to the city centre for shopping .
&quot; as the Chairman of the Gewerbe@@ verein , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers what offers their own city apart from the usual supermarket @-@ goods . &quot;
&quot; according to plan , a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market , is planned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , domestic companies should present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to be invited to &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags which indicate the action weekend , says Christian König . &quot;
municipal administration and business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
thus the commercial association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive city centre . &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers , such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; to the well @-@ held Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ men and hosts in order to move them to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials should be re@@ opened or re@@ opened . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many locals would also have lost the city center while shopping from the view .
&quot; at the end , everyone would have to help revi@@ ve the city centre - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it was time to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which partly grew up , had said King in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , director of the Chamber of Commerce in Mühl@@ hausen , informed that the third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , for the first time , took part in five Thuring@@ ian cities . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; &quot; promote appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common good of our cities &quot; , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action under the leadership of the I@@ HK and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment himself .
two dead and several wounded after explosion at US school
during construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new people were injured .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were wounded , some of them difficult . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire department , on Wednesday ( local time ) there was still a vulner@@ ability in critical condition . &quot;
a person died when a part of a school@@ building collap@@ sed at the explosion .
a first missing was later also found dead .
&quot; at the dead , they were employees of the school . &quot;
&quot; as a mis@@ fortune , the authorities assumed work on a gas pipeline . &quot;
only a few people lived in the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy building .
Tr@@ ump drove through trans@@ liter@@ ated tran@@ scrip@@ tions of telephone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scrip@@ tions of telephone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27th , Tr@@ ump calling for a telephone conversation with Mexican President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to stop publicly declar@@ ing that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president accused him of having publicly den@@ ounced the wall . he said to him , &quot; &quot; This is what you can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States , and s@@ wore to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull was also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr Turn@@ bull that a trade for the United States of refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was convey@@ ed by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; de@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after Mr. Turn@@ bull said that &quot; this is the most in@@ convenient call for the whole day .
Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of viewers in the Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and turned to the Ford @-@ Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver to reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block its way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous suit - took a long train on his c@@ ig@@ ar and glan@@ cing through the wind@@ screen .
inside the in@@ mates flew in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to see this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
cri@@ es broke down the silence when a young black man was distor@@ ted by the co @-@ driver &apos;s seat .
&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene , played on July 22 , is just a post . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the throat of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost everybody in the audience cho@@ oses a very real si@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , civil rights activists have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were out of the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one has ever been charged with murder .
&quot; it is really aw@@ ful that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post @-@ order . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old con@@ gres@@ sman of Georgia and a life of civil rights .
&quot; for him , it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want law enforcement , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
a court physician laying a cloth over the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27th 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process . &quot;
but no one has ever been charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain un@@ restricted for decades , citizens say that double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black people of Georgia to vote on their vote in the summer . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as the choice , according to the F@@ BI figures , Roger Mal@@ com had a white landed propriet@@ or , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from prison , thus the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when they approached the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ed the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and arranged the mur@@ ders , was a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murder , removed evidence and has conce@@ aled the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an electoral law , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen here . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene managed the annual production of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is descrip@@ tive , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many would like it no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch and look more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about Lyn@@ ching because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done through .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest bl@@ acks - pushed into a room and listened when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ coordinated view over the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the boss clan member for years , but he said that the role would never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room , the actors performed Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Squ@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the priest cri@@ es and pus@@ hes him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , --- he , wa@@ ving of my property ! &quot;
they refu@@ te the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out laugh@@ ing .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still gig@@ ging . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think white people back then &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ ched one of the other black actors . &quot;
&quot; you only have to meet the hard &quot; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and precisely there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the un@@ eas@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins again .
&quot; this time when Ras@@ mi says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this re@@ petition termin@@ ates violent and fast .
&quot; there are sh@@ outs , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman clothed with a sad@@ ness , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays tru@@ sting pra@@ ises &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
your voice hits every second word .
&quot; about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen viewers caught sweat and tears from their eyes . &quot;
the audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .
&quot; a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street . &quot;
they have experienced Georgi@@ an intense moisture for nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels gh@@ ost@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body &apos;s name . &quot;
&quot; children squ@@ at their heads , record the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy , as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the crowd - and suddenly it is over . &quot;
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ch and wi@@ pe away their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit that the clan member has played . &quot;
Nick Squ@@ cona pursu@@ es two of his fellow players and then breaks together in her arms and the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done it for a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience sat together with the actors for dinner . &quot;
&quot; at a table , a white pair of Atlanta lawyers ch@@ atted about the succession with a black couple that they just met . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky fought to find words which sense the performance left .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you themselves and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching still continues , &quot; she added , &quot; today this is called only police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds court at his table , he e@@ ats and rec@@ alls the civil rights . &quot;
he said he already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the post @-@ creation is inspiring in a way because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
he who doesn &apos;t study his own history who doesn &apos;t know his own story is condemned to repeat it .

the audience thanks the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .

&quot; there is a big appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure clothing . &quot;
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited .
&quot; in 2013 he had to leave a reed concert in 2013 , five years later there were great che@@ ers in which the occasional &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to rejoice in this .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the dpa . &quot;
&quot; the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it has also grown to be an understanding of its view . &quot;
I draw a positive summary .
max amount works as volunteers
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where anywhere ?
&quot; quantity : normally in Stein@@ furt in the furniture exchange , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I also worked on the school in the open all @-@ day work .
what are your experiences with this ?
&quot; it &apos;s a beautiful , broad spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to deal with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , thus a late @-@ working volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
quantity : I did a high school certificate .
&quot; and then a civil engineer , we say , successfully disman@@ tled . &quot;
&quot; I realized for myself that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people . &quot;
and then I asked myself what do you do .
&quot; make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focus maybe also , really . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
&quot; in the winter semester , I will start studying in the social sciences . &quot;
&quot; I will study dual , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker training and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences . &quot;
isn &apos;t it un@@ common to have several different locations throughout the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ering Service ?

&quot; Pear@@ son shor@@ tens another 3,000 jobs and cuts the divi@@ dend to revit@@ alise the business &quot;
&quot; the UK education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , it will cut more 3,000 jobs and cut its divi@@ dend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing . &quot;
&quot; job reduction , the General Director John Fall@@ on , primarily announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced a third cost reduction plan for cost reduction by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year is unchanged , after achieving an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
Con@@ vo@@ i attack from Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide bomb attack
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul &apos;s Afgh@@ an capital , killed N@@ ato soldiers and injured several others . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded and shared an explanation of N@@ ato .
&quot; according to local reports , three civilians per@@ ished in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bom@@ bing is the last violent action that Afghanistan hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi emb@@ assy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a statement by N@@ ato it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening is to happen , when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; supported &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and be treated in the US military hospital on Bag@@ ram airport .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
at the end of July a suicide bom@@ bed killed at least 30 people in a ch@@ ie@@ fly district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops repres@@ sed the Taliban in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; the violence emphas@@ ises the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan since U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump weighs heavily , the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul in recent weeks also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies , and in particular in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns decision to delay the Smo@@ ke rule according to complaints
&quot; the U.S. environmental protection authority has made a decision to delay Obama &apos;s government regulation , repe@@ aled that the states are committed to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this happened one day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA recently announced the decision to drive forward the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ esty 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said it is showing the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with countries . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA in June to determine the o@@ zone provisions - in which in some parts of the country pollut@@ ant emissions must be measured in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
&quot; a group of 15 most democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda that is to stimulate economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have spar@@ ked the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups who are worried about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of the EPA states that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , can reduce the lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as as@@ thma . &quot;
common room for common room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in case of two votes , the Municipal Council resol@@ ves the establishment of a joint space in the future retirement home . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing portion of the property was signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it will still take place until the area belonging to the parish church is part of the community , there is now no planning event for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion about a common area . &quot;
&quot; one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , offered to meet the community . &quot;
on the ground floor it would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an ad@@ joining terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .
&quot; the administration and majority of the Municipal Council are ho@@ ver@@ ing such a common area not as a meeting place only for residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ent living , but openly in the community . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word from the &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; made the round . &quot;
the decision made by the provision of funds for the ongoing budget has already been decided last autumn by funding opportunities .
the construction is located in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area .
&quot; the establishment of a joint space would be , so reported T@@ j@@ aden , capable of 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposed proposal looks to signal the investor , that in this respect one does not want to throw a cri@@ pple between the legs , the finding that both the saddle - which is le@@ aning on the surrounding construction - as well as til@@ ting roof - what reduces tr@@ uss @-@ height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ m , is this additive . &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many of her own buildings , with which one is not so much forward so that one can now lean on the common space out of the window , she says , &quot; I am struggling with it . &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger speaks for the common room - but absolutely against communal participation .
&quot; behind it , it sees a hidden subsi@@ dy of any wealthy or even foreign investors . &quot;
&quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a genuine exchange value which is market@@ able in case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; governments request to submit the proposed proposal appropri@@ ately , finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; thus it remains with two opposite votes in the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ izes : &quot; if we take this decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
colli@@ sion by car : ra@@ dar@@ s are thrown on the road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and was severely injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police said , the 82 @-@ kilomet@@ rie Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road from the Schwar@@ zer road from Hil@@ den on the bicycle path of the street Schwar@@ zer Weg . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road At the Buch@@ hol@@ zer Bus@@ ch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him supre@@ m@@ acy .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was driving on the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the traffic . &quot;
he joined a car with a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was put into a hospital with a return car .
FC Bayern Munich must do without the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup happens without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund as the first mandatory example of the new season . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the defending champion in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
&quot; in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the personnel will make sure the German football record champion Bayern München are getting bigger at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund . &quot;
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to reno@@ unce to David Al@@ aba in du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
&quot; in addition , the mou@@ ths of Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the lack of balance in his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the team &apos;s balance . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , it was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official obligatory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; we want to play smart , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights draws the fans into their spell .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
walk in the resin of Star to Star
&quot; in the Harz , the first &quot; star path &quot; is to be created . &quot;
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a Plan@@ etary Trail is available in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; is coming to meet the need for information for many visitors . &quot;
&quot; it connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to put up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in the first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; well @-@ accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber came into question . &quot;
the information on the panels should be added to the internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in selecting a location . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the train is to be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star path , the viewers experience a lot of interesting things , such as the physics of the individual stars , &quot; stated the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star appeared stronger than another , even though it would be far more distant . &quot;
&quot; in which con@@ stellation , a selected star can be found and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been operating the highest situated observ@@ atory in Northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; since 2003 in the Uni @-@ Stadt , there has been something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen since 2003 . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s hotel at the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to Ha@@ in@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; alien &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ planet degra@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end@@ point - are placed exactly at the distance and the scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth is shr@@ inking on a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ metres in diameter , while the exactly 75 metres away the sun measures 70 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
the total distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
&quot; while the light from the sun to the Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the entrance hall with Plu@@ to . &quot;
&quot; thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos . &quot;
the march to the next fixed star would last for half a year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a colli@@ sion course to stage the most thrilling boxing campaign in the near future below 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Box@@ ing Council ligh@@ weight champion , down the corridor to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation Super @-@ Feder@@ alist Champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia put out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 PM on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the pair posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia remembered . &quot;
&quot; I have asc@@ ended for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to hang down on lightweight .
and he must move to light weight @-@ weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that &apos;s what the fans demand .
let us give them that . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed . &quot;
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; Klim@@ as asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that will fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 @-@ pound de@@ duction this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interested in the fight against the winner by Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight cover competition in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this battle could take place in the Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans asked him , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and later openly expressed his desire to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he gu@@ esses Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may possibly participate in his Saturday battle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks that the triple fight champion from River@@ side looks very slowly , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the co @-@ Aus . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus was to show impact strength , then boxes . &quot;
they both said they could feel the momentum that was built for their own struggle .
this is the battle that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; I have been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four Ver@@ tical after Ty@@ re Set@@ ters
&quot; in an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon , four people were seriously injured . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was losing control of his vehicle at 16.@@ 30 in front of the junction market . &quot;
the passenger car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he over@@ came and then stayed on the roof in the green strip .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident location . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three chain works better &quot;
&quot; after the 2 : 2 at the season op@@ ener against Br@@ uns@@ wick , Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes that optimi@@ zing the defence report will take place in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first round of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result , too , if there weren &apos;t the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two opponents too much and we have to better watch out in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the three chain is to be further optimized .
and a gate after a colli@@ sion doesn &apos;t want to capture the For@@ tun@@ as any more .
&quot; for the future , there will be no more than Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will better cope with the experience in preparation with the three chain than with the four @-@ leg@@ ged chain .
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; said his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; &quot; because we are in the three chain on the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we can even better harmon@@ ize and we do not make so many fla@@ ws in the construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , also Hoffmann travels to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but whether you can talk about a mis@@ guided start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could indeed be okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we stand with four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a regular season op@@ ener . &quot;
his coach did not want to know about it .
&quot; I judge the start into the season only after six to eight playing days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who did not want to talk of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to a storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season practically with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann might even be able to be a bit fres@@ her since they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a ascen@@ sion favourite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know so 100 % where they are currently , &quot; &quot; says the inner def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland as a light favorite on Sunday go to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we swe@@ ep them away , only because we have the right to come under the first six is rub@@ b@@ ish , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is absolutely positive with only a defeat against Au@@ e out of nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which must be hit from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as chief coach . &quot;
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience its players on Sunday .
new results published by Swedish Asyl@@ um S@@ ass Review
&quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Food Medicine Authority ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started performing the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should make a more precise assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Board ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6.@@ 8@@ 80 cases to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson , from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been steady in recent months . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; he said , The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases to suggest that the investigated person was 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 results , she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had frank@@ ly said that she was 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment involving X @-@ ray images of wisdom teeth and MR@@ I shots of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
a scep@@ tic is the end@@ oc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute whose work encompasses the evaluation of the biological maturity of people to see if they were used earlier or later than usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the kind of measurement should be used .
jud@@ ging biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it certainly , we shouldn &apos;t pret@@ end as if we could , &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency def@@ ends the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of being in@@ correctly judged as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven ton concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs super , &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the department of road and transport in the government president of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began at the same time on all three restructuring need@@ y bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is maintained .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete , cla@@ d with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , she has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure the stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10.@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons of heavy so called bridge cap .
this is a border attachment that is also used as a run@@ way .
&quot; on the southern part of the bridge , a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge is to be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way will take place .
&quot; the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tip feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; because there is also a fibre cable , attached to which many companies are connected . &quot;
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work carried out by hand .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for bridges between the building yard and the collecting area in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is governed by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach place entrance , the road is fully locked in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three brid@@ les is 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colourful protest with German potato salad
&quot; it is not so common that parties tend to pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which is otherwise difficult to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the chal@@ k of Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that is peaceful this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell invites for &quot; big campaign opening &quot; according to the poster . &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ eag@@ les but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally , the town picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned on the well , but now takes place on the parking space below the R@@ ond@@ ola - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those coming to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers .
&quot; what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the forum A world and one of the author@@ itative organis@@ ers , is very happy : &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without any problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; Mario Hom@@ pes reported by the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel , he tried to make such an event and received the supplement . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a rejection , because there were not enough parking spaces because of the Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kirche . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this is also done : at around 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment in the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , including the Rhine @-@ Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D Chairman Uwe Young . &quot;
&quot; some 200 listeners are waiting in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch holding her speeches . &quot;
&quot; the police presence is unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour is the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is to be told shortly after 9 pm . &quot;
the police can move - no special incidents .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a meeting with the Wolf@@ acher tromb@@ onist Freder@@ ic B@@ elli will be present in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli . solo trumpet is the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both unite the desire to not only cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new robe , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; bl@@ ends itself with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz pianist N@@ ils W@@ ogram , mixes classical , jazz and free games to a fascinating synthesis of the arts . &quot;
this core of the programme was first performed this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled meats , and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot;
&quot; but I want to try out everything , &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart on her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague , Robert P@@ att@@ inson who ultimately dealt with bit@@ tern@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all this , the be@@ aut@@ y@@ ful act@@ ress ass@@ ures the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ za@@ ar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone whom I thought . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and seriously believed in it . &quot;
so it has never been confused or interfer@@ ed with .
I &apos;ve never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; she was especially suffered under &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z , &quot; but in the time of school , when she rather dressed like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me very much .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I felt really attacked , frigh@@ tened and disappointed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think , &apos; Girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public do not like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; people expect you to keep you in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot;
as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump already promised a great announcement at West Virginia Rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice endor@@ sed not the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
&quot; Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state according to For@@ bes , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a carbon business from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the change of the party of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party that would hin@@ der us more than to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ements and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , unanim@@ ous message , &quot; said the R@@ NC CEO R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; hon@@ estly &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the world leader of Athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , lob@@ sters on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be re@@ absorbed into the sport again . &quot;
Russian athle@@ tics head D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yla@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the World Athle@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all the athletes , who were grab@@ bed away in competitions of gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e the repor@@ ters . &quot;
the entire Council and the entire Congress pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for his re @-@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; he added &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete at the World Athle@@ tics Championships that start on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
&quot; the leader of IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , he said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
mour@@ ning for the Sol@@ di@@ ted Sol@@ di@@ ers in Mali
&quot; at a fun@@ eral service in the north @-@ h@@ ess@@ ische F@@ ritz@@ lar , some 1000 people of the two soldiers were thought of a helicop@@ ter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precau@@ tions .
&quot; in the still un@@ explained event , Secretary of Defense Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
&quot; they described the two in@@ verse pilots , but as &quot; &quot; cor@@ on@@ ers of their specialist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice which they have achieved in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ hes@@ sen had died on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a vi@@ gi@@ l of the German armed forces in the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er Cathedral St. Peter .
&quot; at mid@@ day , only the relatives in the church took leave . &quot;
&quot; after that , the fun@@ eral celebration began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
&quot; among them were H@@ esse &apos;s Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) , and the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the German Army Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the branches laid down ro@@ ses , the members of the family were arm in arm on the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; before the church , F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
the Defence Minister of the Ley@@ en described the in@@ verse soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and sat@@ ini@@ zed .
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the flying operation of the combat helicop@@ ter tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six well @-@ trained tig@@ ers of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the reg@@ iment to which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this crew couldn &apos;t turn the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; at the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Ley@@ en did not show that the use was dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
after the fun@@ eral the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any statement . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave beside his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
this divided the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already produced a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ ag@@ us for the two .
&quot; the Queen was in agreement with her husband &apos;s decision , it was her message to be informed . &quot;
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still uncle@@ ar .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik has never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also dismis@@ sed the title &quot; &quot; Princess &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he does not see himself as equal to his wife - nor after death , explained L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will eventually be , is still uncle@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years .
&quot; born in 1965 , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ tra@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristoc@@ racy , was born in London in 1965 . &quot;
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French emb@@ assy .
&quot; during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik took over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was wa@@ ver@@ ing , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises I smoked in place of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation here to be the brand of society @-@ critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Nieder@@ sach@@ sen &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the parliament , does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , she spoke out for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Green Party member from their parliament fraction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its tight one @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the hitherto Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen combined her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; declared it Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U Fra@@ c@@ tion@@ chief Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler wants his faction to welcome it .
&quot; thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the parliament , SPD and the Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; to date , the relationship has been revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new country tag is scheduled to be scheduled on 14 January next year .
&quot; he said , the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it can go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it indispensable that the country day decides as quickly as possible its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the Land Constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament withdraw@@ s trust and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot;
&quot; these opportunities must be legally insp@@ ected , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ üm@@ ler . &quot;
you will be able to discuss all the questions in peace if they are legally approved .
&quot; t@@ üm@@ ler named T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; &quot; but rather curious . &quot;
the politi@@ cian herself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she called herself as a tra@@ der of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the apost@@ ate dep@@ u@@ ties to return their country &apos;s mandate .
&quot; of course , we assume that she has received her country mandate , which she has received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; said Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ hn and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; said S &amp; D Group president , Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen tremend@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have consciously decided not to lead a debate in the faction . &quot;
&quot; even against the background that there were no substantial differences , we cannot compreh@@ end this step . &quot;
&quot; the SPD ch@@ anc@@ ellor , Martin Schulz , condem@@ ns the over@@ comes of the parliament of Lower Saxony El@@ ke T@@ westen to CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; the behaviour of former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the chief of the Socialists and Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Parliament .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; in their last vanity and in their fru@@ stration , the politi@@ cian put their personal interests before the well @-@ being of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised the SPD general secretary of Hu@@ ber@@ tus County . &quot;
it is sc@@ andal@@ ous that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this fil@@ thy intri@@ gue and tries to hit political capital from it .
lower Saxony &apos;s CD@@ U frag@@ ment leader Björn Th@@ üm@@ ler wants to recommend to his dep@@ u@@ ties to record El@@ ke T@@ westen into the CD@@ U .
&quot; the president of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ westen to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the 2013 Parliament election with personal career . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time in front of the SPD , the strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin mass of one voice in the Diet . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the Interview , How do we protect ourselves from gre@@ ed ponds , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses about poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from poison@@ ed eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp on the stamp .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ Lebensmittel@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information about the affected egg @-@ bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically impossible . &quot;
is Al@@ di now taking over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the educ@@ ator is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately turned off and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s dis@@ may . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; as well as the manufacturers , the trade has to ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and non @-@ hazardous . &quot;
&quot; if the residual moisture content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5mg / kg is exceeded with eggs , they are not capable of transport . &quot;
&quot; however , un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time the factories are not to blame .
are production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the current state of knowledge , the production companies have no immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must reck@@ on with economic damage due to the illeg@@ ally illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there is too little control in emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
is it missing only at the staff or on the logical jurisdiction ?
it was precisely the official controls that have un@@ covered the process .
&quot; however , the truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a consequ@@ ent clari@@ fication of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in the cases where crimes can be found are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already explained several times that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities .
is the regular al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers are entitled to only obtain safe and market@@ able food .
&quot; when an insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; the pan@@ eled resources are manufacturers , traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately . &quot;
this has to be worked consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the atomic fact becomes clear and un@@ brid@@ led .
how to influence the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; the rules aimed at preventing un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted issues of European soccer clubs will not b@@ other N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
&quot; any consequences will still come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organisation that super@@ vis@@ es the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious champ@@ ions league tournament . &quot;
financial Fair Play rules established in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G must point out that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses .
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to get the Brazilian out of its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can safely make the money loose so that N@@ ey@@ mar under@@ writes and bring it into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy @-@ rich family of Qatar from Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs may apply a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but have to object with legitimate income sources , which enable them to turn the break @-@ even point in their business related to football . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that Ver@@ eine , who had made enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively dec@@ eived and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debts of clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen in favour of the pres@@ idency in 2015 , Alek@@ s@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in will continue to be inti@@ mid@@ ated by excessive expenditure . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing on the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; for the next five years , N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the sum total of EUR 4@@ 4.4 million will be exp@@ elled in the financial statements for the next five years . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 took the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine 60 million Euro ( then USD 82 million ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League were limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise ordinary 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to over@@ haul their financial supervision by raising their income by companies associated with the owners of a club .
&quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ gic company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing was to exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not render this as legitimate income . &quot;
this is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the sponsor@@ ship of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar via payments by the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 denied that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup ambassador will become and such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities is easy to figure out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sanctions against PS@@ G meant that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive to observe any attempt to b@@ ypass the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A had no preliminary discussions with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they spoke under the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not allowed to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than € 10 million with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot selling . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move by saying that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La Liga , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS relating to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ sen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga to a state financed by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
it is very difficult to respect financial fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country .
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
&quot; in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at has made fri@@ y board chocolate for Swiss . &quot;
&quot; now , the sweet co @-@ operation is at a possible end : the airline will re@@ print the order . &quot;
&quot; on request of the news agency , Swiss @-@ spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; around 17 million small red @-@ white , packed charts of 14 grams will distribute the flight attend@@ ants to the passengers prior to landing . &quot;
Swiss Life did not want to give any information about the cost .
&quot; industry insi@@ ders value the order volume according to &quot; &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; &quot; between 1.5 and 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y how many applicants have received it at the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers are coming into question .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract over the spring of 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for an opinion . &quot;
the Swiss chocolate tables have been distributing their flights on board of their flights since 2006 .
&quot; before the Swiss concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry Cal@@ leb@@ aut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;

no@@ stal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this re@@ petition of history is at the same time no@@ stal@@ gic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( as the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to bigger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural art@@ e@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories . &quot;
but as fran@@ chise it feels as if the time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not just because of his absurd hum@@ our ( it contained a original story for a talking box of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by getting to the core of the g@@ ags - middle aged actors play awesome children , who will grow - nevertheless , they managed to win the last part of the heat . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults playing adults now is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the found@@ ational principle , including a riff for the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at one point a character emerges from an Apple Power@@ Book , some inline sk@@ ates and a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the sweet C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there &apos;s another crazy mal@@ ign@@ ant plot , included in Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt ll &apos;s lower lip @-@ bar@@ t by &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now feeling like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s the moments of accidental ins@@ anity that could provoke this fran@@ chise as a kind of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; &quot; series until it reaches what I call his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the world premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now re@@ members a different kind of no@@ stal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East versus West Ring Cont@@ ex@@ ation icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ tuned Greg@@ ory and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an extensive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English are syn@@ ced .
it is an in@@ gen@@ ious idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV how Americans might do it with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick offers , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vig@@ ny - ensures a decent match &apos; Find the voice out &apos; . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda @-@ drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is included - that it often happens like a single one .
&quot; there are six long episodes , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who has been re@@ arranged to a smaller length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef continue to visit the American emb@@ assy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything to feed for a vag@@ ue .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
blow against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police have succeeded in making a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart . &quot;
fifteen accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and had already issued an arrest warrant against them .
&quot; in addition , the officials charged greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euro . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , two persons were arrested in Italy . &quot;
&quot; against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans , there were German Ar@@ rest War@@ rant orders . &quot;
the two are probably delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the campaign .
more than 300 police officers were in use .
&quot; the Maf@@ ia members are accused of organised drug crime , heavy violence , desper@@ ate murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and ext@@ or@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office of Kon@@ stanz started to investigate the organised drug trade in southern Germany . &quot;
&quot; between the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , on Wednesday mor@@ row , the large @-@ scale deployment was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the sight of the investigations , Italian citizens mainly resi@@ ded with closely related to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired up into a restaurant at the early morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
way su@@ cks large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; data from citizens who should not show up &quot; &quot; according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for the Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large gaps in the For@@ eig@@ ner Central Registry . &quot;
&quot; defici@@ encies in the data registered there could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , in a manner in which the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; has been analysed . &quot;
&quot; according to the data , ten million people with foreign citizenship are recorded in the register , among them about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
&quot; since the data has not been adequately maintained , the data quality has not been good in parts so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 was found , &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data inputs can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in the statistics of people who travel abroad , there are also EU citizens who wouldn &apos;t have to travel abroad . &quot;
&quot; but such mis@@ concep@@ tions led &quot; &quot; to a distor@@ ted debate on dealing with a paid @-@ out &quot; , &quot; that is , in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the German government has apparently started sending refugee families to Italy with less than 16 year old children if they have entered from there . &quot;
&quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New Os@@ nab@@ rück Newspaper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; therefore , the paper states that BA@@ MF is conducting such proceedings &quot; concerning families with children , with the exception of inf@@ ants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on the ground . &quot;
&quot; according to the Dublin Convention , the EU state is responsible for refugees , which they first reach . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant is travelling to another EU country , this state can return it to the entry @-@ line . &quot;
&quot; for the reason , the ministry is now writing : &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot;
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) holds these commitments for sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin agreement .
&quot; the internal political spokes@@ person of the left faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human rights and a haz@@ ard to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , the blood donation service already provided for other people . &quot;
&quot; at least from the twelve citizens , who were honoured on Friday . &quot;
&quot; all of them are Jürgen Gre@@ ene , who meanwhile distributed 50 litres of blood with his meanwhile 100 donations . &quot;
traditionally the congregation s@@ wo@@ ops several times in the meeting of the Municipal Council to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; it is in@@ gen@@ ious how our body is created for it and we appl@@ aud the don@@ ors &apos; respect , which provide their blood for strangers , still useless , &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ised mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the Regional Director of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ en@@ bacher , for the preserved foods are broken into their constitu@@ ent parts . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ en@@ bacher reported about the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K district leader . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house has resulted in increased numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a um@@ lau@@ rel were among the multi@@ ples and were awarded for each 50 donations . &quot;
&quot; half as many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dorothe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter reduced ten times per 500 milli@@ litres of their life @-@ juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is likely to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; when it kept the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure .
&quot; the monetary policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , whereby less members expected a rise in this month because the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly infl@@ ation@@ ary report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % , and warned that the pressure on household income would rise , while inflation is expected to rise to almost 3 % in the fall . &quot;
but they sign@@ alized that interest rates would be necessary in the coming years to hu@@ g the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and they said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
members also agreed to withdraw part of the mam@@ mot@@ h business package which was issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the coming February , although it has been said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continued to limit consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the interest rates , it re@@ affir@@ med that &quot; &quot; a certain stream@@ lining of monetary policy &quot; &quot; for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; somewhat larger &quot; &quot; scale would be required than the markets expect . &quot;
markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases were &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to the dollar and the euro after these news .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of a interest rate and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % increased to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
&quot; growth is expected to lie at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will easily recover after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor enh@@ ancements , as the tigh@@ tening is first even worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; income from income , but she added that wages at the end of her three @-@ year forecast can &quot; &quot; clearly &quot; &quot; recover . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which is compens@@ ated for a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after the interest rates fall to 0.25 % last August following the shock@@ ing EU vote , which caused the t@@ ines of the ground . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the Bank &apos;s last decision on interest rates , the call has increased after a rate of interest , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed homes , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation last month fell from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and will continue to attract them over the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said that the exceeding in proportion to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; completely &quot; &quot; attribut@@ able to the weak pound . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline in the Swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive as the credi@@ tors are looking for shops and want to finish the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is very good for those with which the current deals are running and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are closed , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be 10,000 people controversial HIV @-@ Drug &quot;
&quot; as of September , patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight in the N@@ HS for funding the drug in the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ press proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) before the intercourse , which can reduce the risk of infection in high risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by the health service via a first three @-@ yearly study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ als confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chef Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to allow people to sign up , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ press proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken prior to sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection haz@@ ards .
taking pre@@ p before intercourse means that just enough medication is present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications may be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , appropriate participants are identified to agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV @-@ status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy . &quot;
people living in England and registered with a GP can also opt @-@ in to participate in their local attending sexual clinic .
the program will receive £ 10 million and N@@ HS UK signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to evaluate the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , as it is targeted and implemented in a large scale . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ haul the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in cop@@ ing with one of humanity &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if targeted and vulnerable people are targeted , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot;
&quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on H@@ od@@ g@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and rel@@ uc@@ tant implementation by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court home into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , fell in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not grab@@ bed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I looked for something comparable to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot large apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne closet space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the Archit@@ ec@@ tural and Design@@ studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over@@ lap , so that the architectural challenge consisted in creating a mezzanine where you could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the requirement .
&quot; the ste@@ el@@ work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on top of each other , without ne@@ sting ourselves . &quot;
&quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled it to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; using mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window into another room . &quot;
at the entrance we offer mirr@@ ored units for all the fun@@ nels and glasses of jo@@ anne .
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering started in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is counter@@ weigh@@ ty , so that when you push the door , it is very easy to gli@@ de . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day , you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
&quot; here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high @-@ quality materials , which give the space its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and help them to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t de@@ ar@@ est into the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and higher square metric tons of something standard@@ ly into something amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them . &quot;
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an argument because of one of the largest real estate imperi@@ alis@@ ms of Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football @-@ Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . &quot;
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from the family business since 2014 but a sharp analysis of the separation takes place at the Supreme Court of Justice .
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the Brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; based in Wai@@ b@@ lingen near Stuttgart , Germany , and employing 6,@@ 100 associates , the Bosch Packaging Technology division is one of the leading suppliers of process and packaging technology . &quot;
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; following an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in was described by Paul as &quot; the main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of company assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
&quot; a court file states that this means that col@@ in property has a value of $ 316 million , and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars . &quot;
the division of property and cash has proved to be a point of appeal for Paul .
&quot; the assessments suggested by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed medi@@ ations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business , of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , have excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul to manage some poss@@ essions in@@ compet@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; in an early affir@@ m@@ ative case submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage says that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost increases in the event , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held law firms . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who had run milk @-@ bars and delic@@ at@@ ess@@ ens from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans@@ load of the family .
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of High School when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) .
Anna De Lu@@ tis says she and Luigi who died in 2012 hoped to share their property with her sons .
&quot; Luigi told me often that he never wanted the brothers to come to court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , where Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company . &quot;
&quot; Luke as well as Mark were , &quot; Paul said about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in has kept himself back even though he was a former AF@@ L member and after a biography from the year 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV movie .
Fair@@ fax Media received contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in replied by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much &quot; because the case is in front of the courts .
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and to draw our sur@@ name through the dishes , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said , adding that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot;
umps of new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reported that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a smo@@ other course .
here is a piece by repor@@ ter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , gathered at his first day of work with leading employees , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House that he wants to repair : poor information that comes into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring its media diet . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ umps ties to television last decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed because of unfair reporting it was productive to show him that he got a fair reporting of places that were to convince , &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign manager Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February towards Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; the key to keeping Tr@@ umps Twitter custom was under control , according to six ex @-@ election officials there to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot;
al@@ right .
but the idea that Tr@@ umps &apos;s Twitter custom ever was under control is ridi@@ culous .
maybe these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know others - that tr@@ umps didn &apos;t contain any more fuel without their intervention .
we probably never know about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump didn &apos;t send .
&quot; if his associates hired him a few times , to keep anger from him , their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
but nobody has ever been able to prevent it from provo@@ king tr@@ ump @-@ controversi@@ es .
&quot; part of the problem is that the people in a White House , who are composed of competing parties , always attempt to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material that possibly promotes their views of the world . &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ers to give the President dou@@ bt@@ ful information to the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump is able to react to negative press cuts like a volcano , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he tries to find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; that happened at the end of February when someone suspected the President mal@@ icious a printed copy of an article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the web site of Internet pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy commander K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to be &quot; the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; at the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter , or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false repro@@ aches in the past and has rev@@ oked it . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and began asking employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , attempted to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tried three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self and his advis@@ ers are still looking for influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after crimin@@ als receive mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the people is asked and hoped for . &quot;
the police across Europe send post@@ cards to dangerous crimin@@ als during this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
&quot; since the addresses of the sought @-@ after crimin@@ als are not known naturally , references from the population are hoped and asked . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the action following the &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from the winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences showed that many fle@@ eting escaped on holiday destinations , was called by Euro@@ pol . &quot;
21 post@@ cards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries have been put together .
&quot; since 2016 the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times , has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online content could be captured so far , at least eleven of it due to indications of publication on the website . &quot;
passengers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return back to &apos; Milli@@ on@@ aire &apos;s Series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travellers on the foot of the war , who have negoti@@ ated a dit@@ ch drawn by the church to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous street of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the Milli@@ on@@ aire &apos;s series . &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were kick@@ ed out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch dig@@ ging from the Council to prevent their incur@@ sions . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defensive structures and squee@@ zed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry inhabitants have pushed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said , &quot; They went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced into action by shame to implement , as it was useless in dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , moved on and are back again . &quot;
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long teachings to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my taxes , if the Council cannot stop it . &quot;
&quot; a local who did not want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
&quot; the numbers have increased this time , and you even saw a horse in the car park . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person for the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to make it move as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
this helps to create a picture of the situation where the court must examine when we present our case .
&quot; from Birken@@ hof , then Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise &quot;
&quot; from the former hotel Birken@@ hof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located . &quot;
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; due to the closure of the hotel Birken@@ hof through the Ambiente Operating Company Ltd until 13 April 2014 , some 30,000 over@@ nights per year were lost and income from the tourist tax was also lost . &quot;
&quot; in the autumn of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the district , the hotel building offered the council office as a group accommodation , which provided controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the housing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted in the Council at that time .
&quot; but above all Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious potential customers at the house back then . &quot;
he should keep right .
&quot; the group of Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ausen with business@@ woman Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and will again make it a house of the Three Star Plus Category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former hotel Birken@@ hof , there have been construction sh@@ utt@@ ings in front of the entrance for some time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations will be made . &quot;
&quot; the floors were torn out , ceilings are partly demoli@@ shed , old bath@@ tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still a lot to do in March .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built into . &quot;
&quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; beautiful &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery , &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale downtown level , under@@ lined sh@@ ear@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the forest hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide , says Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; either single vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel at ease in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already conducted talks with OB @-@ Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the ideas of the city were identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investment required , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to specify precisely . &quot;
&quot; less than a million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; also the outdoor plants are brought forward to the front @-@ man , this is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant that is public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ monkey : us special organis@@ er sets Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russian affair with US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ators Robert Mu@@ eller should have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury for a report . &quot;
&quot; the committee took up work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; calling on familiar people . &quot;
the newspaper reported the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended and intensi@@ fied his investigation .
&quot; the station CN@@ N reported , there were already first charges of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between the old son and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
U.S. intelligence services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin to engage in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller investig@@ ates whether there were agreements between Tr@@ umps election team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men are to stand , who acted as advisor to the Republi@@ can in the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; report@@ edly , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ umps of private and business environment under the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the special issu@@ er Tr@@ ump came to the center personally and investigate whether the President could possibly hin@@ der the ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to prove this evidence in possible crime cases , and to decide whether it should be charged . &quot;
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called to count .
&quot; in most cases , they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the panel can also be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in order to charge people for inter@@ rog@@ ation under oath .
&quot; according to the station CN@@ N , lectures have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; people who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement , said it in the report . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. there were also Tr@@ umps consultant and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his former election campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort .
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the suspension would show that Mu@@ eller would not be inti@@ mid@@ ated in his work , and that he should act quickly if necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the institution of the Gre@@ mi@@ um is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concern for president Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President , on Thursday evening , used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russian affair as a campaign for its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russian history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the topic gives the democr@@ ats an opportunity to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
&quot; his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement , he knew nothing about setting up a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; however , these work usually in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House re@@ jects any action that acceler@@ ates the work of the special switch to &quot; fair &quot; mode .
the former F@@ BI boss James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the President .
&quot; there is no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the Declaration . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey fired .
&quot; because of this root @-@ throw accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have been loud , he refused to im@@ pe@@ de the ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him for an investigation of the investigation against the national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special worker and his associates . &quot;
the spec@@ ulative spec@@ ulation is whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller would release .
&quot; unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the later President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he theore@@ tically could be fired by the president of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a move .
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented legislative dra@@ fts on Thursday , after which the special medi@@ ator could no longer be released so easily . &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : giant ice @-@ mountain drives in Ant@@ arc@@ tica
in the western Ant@@ arc@@ tic a gigantic ic@@ eberg has loos@@ ened from the scar@@ cely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
this was granted by the Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the col@@ os@@ sus across a Bil@@ lion ton , heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers , is now driving north and probably need two , three years until it mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 km , it is one of the largest ice @-@ gi@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger to man from him .
&quot; to what extent climate change has played a role in breaking the ic@@ eberg , is uncle@@ ar after research data . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , there have been a series of unusual inter@@ rup@@ tions of ice ho@@ ops in the region for about 30 years , writes the U.S. Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming . &quot;
the now de@@ pl@@ eted col@@ os@@ sus was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
it flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it grows further into the sea and breaks out regularly .
the Lar@@ sen C Sch@@ el@@ bat lies south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula .
North of this scho@@ oling the balance of wa@@ xing and v@@ om@@ iting was disturbed a few years ago .
&quot; a complete Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ts be sm@@ ashed there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of evidence that Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , as the front edge has never with@@ drawn as far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice plate stands under tension and can fall apart if at a key point a piece ab@@ rup@@ ts . &quot;
melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ts and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level because they float on the water and ice so much water as it produces after melting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ se causes the glaci@@ ers to flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase sea level , but only in a small extent , writes the British research project for the observation of Ant@@ arc@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI @-@ information , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest jack@@ al of Ant@@ arc@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the crossing from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks out regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural event and we have no direct connection to climate change , the ice sign is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most broad@@ est retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; scientists have argued whether the Lar@@ sen C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will now grow back or go back in the long term , and possibly coll@@ ectively , said his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if these researchers did not lead the demoli@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ eberg to climate change , the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula flour@@ ished in recent decades . &quot;
this long skirt of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic extends in the direction of South America .
&quot; according to data from the research programme British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
the decline in temperature increased .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has been warming up around three degrees over the last 50 years and thus count towards the areas where the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants to give Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy free places , the CD@@ U asks to leave the employer association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , 41 new places in the administration have drow@@ ned . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the Kreis@@ verwaltung in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 tra@@ inees have completed their first day of work .
the apprentic@@ es@@ hips at the circuit are apparently very cov@@ eted .
some 620 applications were recorded for the places to be distributed this year .
&quot; however , the circle continues to lack staff to cope with the increased demands and challenges . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration , are sought . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the parties &apos; desire , the administration is to work out a concept for recru@@ iting personnel and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term demands on specialists , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented job shortage , it is said . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should orient@@ ate itself internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and include an education offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems you did not know before .
other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
the speech is of a real competition by the public employer .
&quot; in addition , a high number of employees , due to illness or age @-@ related reasons , comes from the service . &quot;
&quot; the highest time for action , therefore , cannot remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint motion with his party . &quot;
he had long been sor@@ row@@ ful for a f@@ oul @-@ thick surprise when he publicly challenged personnel expenses and start@@ led the rest of the parties .
people want all possibilities to be checked that allow an exit from the local employers &apos; association .
&quot; if we do not come here at short notice to a satisfying solution , the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should strive for a house @-@ tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; said peoples . &quot;
&quot; thus , the CD@@ U tries to pay better the employees and officials than it actually pre@@ views the tari@@ ff of the public service . &quot;
&quot; sal@@ aries are currently precisely prescribed , increases or more money is only available when switching to a higher level that is oriented to professional years . &quot;
&quot; however , the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years . &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees had to take care of the provisions of the new constitution protection law . &quot;
&quot; last but not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone to NGO migrant lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; when NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat of the German Relief Organisation &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet , &quot; because their team worked effectively with traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to express detailed alleg@@ ations by the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; the organization said in a statement on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only evaluate all alleg@@ ations that are currently being raised , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is suspected that his crew receives infl@@ atable migrants on board , which can be delivered directly from traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting was suppos@@ edly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the Prosec@@ utor , whose contents were published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of being over@@ thrown by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the area of humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta have to have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize winner organisation doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations occurred in recent weeks , indicating that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local civil servants have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine female bi@@ kers , the &quot; &quot; Berliner Out@@ post &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the North @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy four days of tri@@ als and sights . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , three friendly guides were available . &quot;
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the fort and wine festival of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour conducted hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle near Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; view@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could see far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream levels . &quot;
&quot; in between there were again and again extended asc@@ ents , for the long trials rewarded . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the popular saus@@ age market .
&quot; again , look@@ out point was at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flew &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers were told again . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ scri@@ bed hu@@ ts brought welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers breath@@ ed in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium healing br@@ ine .
also Neustadt has been controlled .
&quot; after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres altitude , the group met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps itself for e @-@ sport
&quot; in the future , sports stars are sitting in front of computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium racing during wind and weather ? &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ga@@ its included . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport @-@ division in mid @-@ July and took two pro@@ s for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire all new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says President Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; that on this move some clubs will rise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; next weekend , FIFA World Cup FIFA in London will organize the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven qualified for example . &quot;
also Robin Dut@@ t sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the former coach of Bayer L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that young people will also go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
what is it about ?
&quot; in e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the football simulation FIFA are challenged on competition level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , like in normal sports , leag@@ ues have established themselves in which professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and at the 2022 Olympic Games , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme . &quot;
but is it all about a correct sport ?
&quot; for many , the idea is sure of getting used . &quot;
Ingo F@@ rob@@ bing has also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; e @-@ sport is a sport for the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne , because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sports - for example increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hor@@ m@@ onal changes . &quot;
&quot; it also needs cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and rapid response . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console , but also their body and pay attention to nutrition . &quot;
&quot; the f@@ itt@@ y player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; however , the rob@@ ber also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing becomes increasingly a topic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing . &quot;
the scientist empha@@ sizes the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
&quot; players are on the road internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles . &quot;
a study by the Consult@@ ancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) pre@@ di@@ cts rapid growth to the e @-@ sport .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ship , and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , turnover is expected to reach 130 million . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
internationally many countries are already on the move .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez will participate in the US Team NR@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood Ac@@ tor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e @-@ sport competition supplier Uni@@ kr@@ n .
&quot; in Europe , too , there is a lot to do . &quot;
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as instruc@@ tional subject , says F@@ rob@@ bing . &quot;
Dut@@ t is now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department in the Netherlands and France according to Dut@@ t .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ ged behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B board Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; to exp@@ el only in no@@ stal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times , is no longer enough today . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; &quot; says Dut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t cling to it , that only in football everything remains as it was always . &quot;

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter sentenced to suicide because of the lyrics by Roy Con@@ rad Roy
&quot; a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to commit suicide . &quot;
&quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June due to the negli@@ gent murder of Con@@ rad Roy , who took the life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing , &quot; My family is un@@ comfor@@ ted . &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appointment .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both they and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward looking eyes when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have changed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; horri@@ ble circum@@ stance that they completely regret . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz told , however , he did not find out that their &quot; old age &quot; or maturity or even their mental illness might have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read an explanation of Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy who said that there is &quot; no day when I do not mo@@ urn the loss of my beloved Son .
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I surround me . I try , in spite of all my sor@@ eness that we will wear for eternity with us , to be there for His sisters , &quot; &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys Si@@ ster , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; persec@@ uted &quot; &quot; by the realization that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; not to have this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy found dead of a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case drew attention to national attention , after Car@@ ter revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang up , spring from a building , catch yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Car@@ ter atten@@ ds the death of Roy and ordered that she should profit from the case through some press .
the case has shared legal opinions .
Am@@ anda Kno@@ x was one of the few who defended Car@@ ter in 2007 due to murder of her British ro@@ ommate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not in prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
&quot; that Joshua Kim@@ me was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup , is not a coinci@@ dence . &quot;
the FC Bayern dar@@ es to win a big season to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm .
&quot; something was different from his place in the cabin , which Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ ly saw immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he just made his arm tied to it . &quot;
&quot; the trainer didn &apos;t announced it , &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as Bavaria @-@ Kap@@ itän . &quot;
well the obj@@ ection could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i also could interpret the sign of the coach .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f from youth players , debu@@ ggers and just from holiday professionals , but he . &quot;
&quot; the sweet@@ ness of sugar is best distributed to those of whom you trust a lot , which you want to keep in your mood . &quot;
anyone who has been chosen to enter the inheritance of Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ i confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility .
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old scored a Mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field . &quot;
&quot; at the right rear , that is his position , the white ban@@ dage at the arm did the rest . &quot;
and Kim@@ ber@@ ly worked in this launch as the one who is able to take the helm well into the hand .
he gave orders to direct the un@@ played tro@@ op .
&quot; he had the view for the whole , while many others were busy with himself . &quot;
&quot; V@@ idal there@@ with to re@@ play his missing fitness ( fol@@ ly hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ cher with it , on Teufel come out to the performances of the Asia @-@ trip ( also only condi@@ tionally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le have not neg@@ atively drop in their first appearance at the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot . &quot;
&quot; after all , it worked quite well . &quot;
&quot; in addition Kim@@ me , Rud@@ y , ran off to the defense , both ag@@ ged confi@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm often proved difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried successfully in the build up a few times . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Rud@@ y , though , admitted that the outcome was not as we had hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a neat performance at the debut .
&quot; for this style , I was also picked up . &quot;
&quot; as usual this Bavarian world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw in the connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; for example Rud@@ y gave no one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ me said good@@ bye after a few cr@@ un@@ chy sa@@ y@@ ings in the back of his new te@@ amm@@ ates .
&quot; there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one anymore . &quot;
Al@@ aba Motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B Women
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s most famous foot@@ b@@ aller has been reported about Twitter shortly before the game and the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies wanted all the best .
the Bavaria @-@ legi@@ on@@ aire is a quasi @-@ club of Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ captain Sch@@ na@@ der@@ beck and fi@@ eb@@ ert with our lad@@ ys .
the twe@@ et of the Austrian football winner of the year and Champions League winners should be a special motiv@@ ating factor .
the famous Bayern @-@ Dus@@ el might also be good for our ladies .
company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : Wirtschaft lo@@ oses Wis@@ ment Tempo
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still Minister of State of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this shows itself after more than a year when the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ ser ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ ser attacks the desires of the economy , which Lem@@ ke all blocked . &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around sees nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the link between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
&quot; this year , the Ministry hopes to host a planning procedure , until 2021 the right to construction is to be established . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the western circum@@ ference of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the federal traffic plan . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to put the course into operation in December 2020 , &quot; says Minister @-@ spokes@@ woman Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees in this a sign@@ post to support regional , but international competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier is striving , as was stimul@@ ated by Wis@@ ser , in order to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Wis@@ ser has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young tra@@ inees in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
a premium of 1000 Euro is fores@@ een for the completed master &apos;s exam and 2500 euros if graduates choose to do their own independently within ten years of the master &apos;s degree course .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction is quick to provide facts , at the same time it is out of the country the necessary personnel , says Jan Glock@@ auer , chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier . &quot;
&quot; from 56 new engineers who want to recru@@ it Wis@@ ser in the state @-@ run business , only 29 jobs have been occupied until now . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce demands more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; in addition to the comp@@ utation of the Court of Audi@@ tors , CD@@ U frei@@ ghter Christian Bald@@ auf points out more than 20 million euros less than suggested in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as to how to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot;
the former broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;

&quot; on the other hand , ex @-@ econom@@ ist E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the Wind Power Corporation Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke to April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months of discre@@ pan@@ cies she had already cleared the field . &quot;
&quot; Audi aims to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers see themselves confronted with a counter @-@ reaction &quot;
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Group said the company believes that &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; and thus related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Daimler announced that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot;
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as call@@ back .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .
&quot; but the nitrogen ox@@ ides , which em@@ it diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of car manufacturers to install equipment for neutr@@ alising the exhaust gases em@@ itted by diesel vehicles is also increasing , which makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of aband@@ oning the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut @-@ off devices that regul@@ ates emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested but under normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted ; others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was focused on the United States has been expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could seriously strain Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disp@@ ro@@ portion@@ ately to the gain of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; so that the Is@@ ar visitors also join , on tomorrow &apos;s Saturday a raft through Munich , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; if you go to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , you will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach bridge . &quot;
&quot; and this is not a bli@@ ss@@ ful raft , with Is@@ ar @-@ tourists . &quot;
but the building lecture wants to clarify .
&quot; on the raft , one sees a large inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ ational parameter . &quot;
it shows a gar@@ bage dump .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a public@@ ity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; with the motto &quot; True love , &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should be shar@@ pen@@ ed as a protecting game . &quot;
&quot; last summer , the raft sailed across the Is@@ ar and also this year there are more actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behaviour . &quot;
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and the laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was at times one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ ons , the names of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
even with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an exc@@ els and works on a film .
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; There is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he worked as a carto@@ onist for congrat@@ ulation cards - which made him fru@@ str@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough happened at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then in &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own data , he is still sitting on the drawing , working almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; over cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for big and small , t @-@ shirts , plus@@ hes and watches find its dro@@ ll figures still widely spread worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years , he has also been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with his characters . &quot;
the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los favourite animal in his drawings - who has a thous@@ and@@ ard as a counter @-@ player .
&quot; for the first time , his characters in the 3D movie will be talking to the cin@@ em@@ as in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; that &apos;s why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is constantly being produced . &quot;
Lav@@ en@@ del threatened from the Provence from climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change . &quot;
&quot; due to the conditions of d@@ rought , the la@@ ven@@ der is decl@@ ining , causing serious head@@ aches to scientists and farmers who try to find solutions . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the life of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small z@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot on the game .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil is not only temp@@ ting for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse states , &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant drilling with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slow@@ ing down evap@@ oration of the soil , but also spra@@ ying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

the assass@@ ination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce normally meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they told them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists are discussing what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leaving them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ r@@ als , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdominal feelings reach . &quot;
&quot; there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no break from violence , and while the bodies accum@@ ulate throughout the country , there are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took up his office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are at least seven dead in seven countries this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence is felt deep , although his presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice . &quot; two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts that show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or its typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and repor@@ ters discuss their shared topics , trau@@ ma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Special State At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 , in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders connected with drug traff@@ icking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ err@@ atic and even though the terrain is still tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of safety has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very sil@@ ly to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the Why , we di@@ str@@ ust all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
he was forced to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; 12th river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter went away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but Val@@ dez is nothing more than silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the country &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields , as ri@@ val fac@@ tions are fighting to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the road or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of decorated , two @-@ story Maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control of the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States .
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ ene Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this release may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed v@@ ein members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez to leave Val@@ dez , after conf@@ isc@@ ating another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
he served as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ si@@ o and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courage@@ ous and honest reporting , revenues and advertising . &quot;
&quot; repor@@ ters dar@@ ed to be able to publish harsh investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to deal with . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history wherever they were . &quot;
he gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue to live , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
&quot; you have to take over the task , which falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What did you do in the face of so many dead ? why did you not tell what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was able to curse like a harbor worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite from the office , and always sit there on the same table . &quot;
now they ask : was his love for routine his destruction ?
&quot; his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their job best , and to stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you engage with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home start@@ - and run@@ ways &quot; to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ in@@ cts .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing happened to Ja@@ vier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - as not as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a poison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; in the room in which the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ pol@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who signed the Gover@@ nor himself as un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the repor@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ pol@@ ce rested on three main stories .
there was assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous speaker Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é about the state spending that was concentrated on the home town of the governor .
&quot; there was a group that was ab@@ duc@@ ted in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Prosec@@ utor . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kid@@ n@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) that ruled almost the whole century all political levels .
recently several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , the readers would have seen the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of the kid@@ n@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; before we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez has become a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they themselves never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
repor@@ ter Mi@@ riam Ram@@ i@@ rez grab@@ bed a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning for a further journalist on the Office of the Prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burned @-@ in body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is its . &quot;
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing &quot; SO@@ S Press &quot; protests and constructions in organized protests . &quot;
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , she has asked that she is re @-@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organized crime including government officials and a similar society .
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces that were hiding under a blanket with organised crime . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to hold the mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a det@@ err@@ ent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern limit state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found along with a note , which was supposed to be signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones were standing next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border @-@ state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue on how El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with a editorial on the title page titled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile and they still watch the streets and look for danger .
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , states that the drug trade is scar@@ ing him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and so I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , as at once all their phones began to sum@@ mon . &quot;
a series of shooting with Band@@ en@@ riv@@ alen and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated further as it was promised by a series of cart@@ el emb@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the Bord@@ ino edge they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens resting near - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept their guard to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ pol@@ ce followed his tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; if on the same day , when Ja@@ vier was murdered , the train@@ ee asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used clo@@ ak to avoid his enemies
&quot; at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening . &quot;
&quot; now researchers have found out that the first findings of the unbelievable r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian min@@ ers have been preserved so well that experts described it as &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that they could even discover that his fla@@ ky skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of an &quot; &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the persistent veget@@ ative din@@ osau@@ r , who has ever been found , and one of the world &apos;s best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens . &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of natur@@ a that lived in the middle of the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved condition has aston@@ ished researchers , who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic the arm@@ oured plant @-@ e@@ ater is the best @-@ preserved fossil of its kind .
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he gru@@ b on March 21 , 2011 in the S@@ unc@@ or M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the North of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he met something out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth l@@ umps . &quot;
after all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only b@@ link a little with your eyes , you might almost believe it has slept , &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is seen . &quot;
&quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specimens , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; researchers found out that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , even though it is covered with an arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by meat e@@ aters din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a counter @-@ bur@@ ial , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to get better in his surroundings and to do@@ dge his enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ auri@@ er has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now visible at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ ab@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours , carefully covering it . &quot;
the amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ shade , a widespread defense @-@ method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the con@@ ter@@ ation is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the living animals living today . &quot;
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r of enough pressure was hun@@ ted by meat eating din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution fav@@ oured the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ shade - think of roe deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than boot@@ y , indicating that this No@@ dos@@ ha was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es must have been the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on po@@ inters about his life , including his con@@ served intestinal per@@ usal to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r when he died , got into a river and pushed out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the se@@ abed . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as Sou@@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably far@@ ther far@@ ther inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ auri@@ er is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preser@@ v@@ ative schu@@ pp@@ iger skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and re@@ tains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal today looks the same as in the early Cre@@ tac@@ eous period .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you only play a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that he is in sleep . &quot;
&quot; the Cre@@ tac@@ eous period was a time when huge thermal geo@@ des , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , crossed the Earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ au@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was ch@@ ased by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he buried in the S@@ unc@@ or M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the du@@ sty arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is complete from mu@@ zzle to hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures had an average of around 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; it contained two 20 @-@ inch long sp@@ ik@@ es , which hung from his shoulders . &quot;
the researchers believe that the arm@@ oured plant @-@ e@@ ater was swe@@ pt through the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are preserved so well that the bon@@ fires cover still b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a lot@@ tery prize . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot;
&quot; his right foref@@ oot lies at his side , his five fingers are spread upwards . &quot;
I can count the scales on its sole .
in thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 cars are wrapped in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , kilomet@@ re @-@ long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first indications of the police were about 5 p.m. between the junction stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 cars , among them probably also trucks . &quot;
&quot; at first , there are no indications of the exact number of injured parties . &quot;
&quot; it is a light to medium @-@ heavy injury , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large amount of b@@ ail@@ out vehicles was at the accident site .
the A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich an approximately ten kilometres long back sta@@ u formed .
&quot; as a AZ @-@ repor@@ ter reports , it also came on the counter track to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire bri@@ gade was the mark of the vehicle anch@@ ors , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pun@@ ish@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
it was a colli@@ sion between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicop@@ ter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing remin@@ ding you in the train and sleeping .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just an in@@ gen@@ ious thought .
and then : buff@@ alo .
comes the conductor and ar@@ ouses an uns@@ an@@ ted or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspec@@ tions .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the paper@@ less ticket inspec@@ tions .
one simply confirms by mobile phone that one occupies its place and thus evalu@@ ates the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test run runs on two tracks . &quot;
&quot; when the offer comes , we expand it . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be available at many other high@@ ways in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said a rail@@ road speaker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; calls the train de@@ valuation without a conductor . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use this , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have an online ticket - which already most passengers do .
&quot; it also has to be purchased via the subway , DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking . &quot;
&quot; finally , you need a seat reservation . &quot;
&quot; because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like that : you get into the train , call his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the test customers , a button for electronic de@@ valuation will appear . &quot;
the train companions get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and taken the booked seat Y .
&quot; comes the train companion at ticket inspec@@ tions to place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already vali@@ dated online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can still sleep , keep on working , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn uses the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ti@@ ck@@ eting through our train companion staff , in the DB Navigator , simply check yourself . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , member of the Marketing Management Board of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who go underground , know that in addition to delays and missed trains , the ticket inspec@@ tions are among the biggest problems . &quot;
&quot; for many times , however , in any case one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents required for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either the credit card or identity card is missing , or else a document you have to assign . &quot;
&quot; the result is endless discussions between rider and passenger , leading to bad mood in the compartment or greater space and delays in controlling their own ticket , and taking the time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s just the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken up to its core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a mail from someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; confused , as nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed on Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ret@@ we@@ eted on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ et the death of Michael Brown , a un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns lifel@@ ess body hanging on the street and staying there for four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put her cell phone to twe@@ et later in the evening to twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people crying out , and from a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who was wearing a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman deta@@ ined his ri@@ fle and cried , &quot; I am going to kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we have ac@@ custom@@ ed to and which we can call typical .
at that moment I felt shi@@ ver@@ ing frost .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
you booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cin@@ em@@ as after 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance which consists of the people &apos;s point of view and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a matching crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
we are going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right .
&quot; I couldn &apos;t take her away , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot;
what is happening today is a high point of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be raised therein .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to liber@@ ate ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience anti @-@ lat@@ ent rac@@ ism , she is not different from the next black female child . &quot;
I feel I would have a bad service to keep them away from it .
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp territory when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed totally after August 9 , &quot; she said , and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis as president of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
everything has come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ F@@ AR@@ RA@@ R only wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to the point : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community prof@@ iting from their pain and their resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an already collabor@@ ated with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt in@@ mates . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought the project near@@ er to Fer@@ rel@@ l , along with six other n@@ atives , the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; followed suit in the years after Brow@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we talk , &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , because so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the aim was not to focus on Ferr@@ is &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a m@@ essi@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most open participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; are surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ara &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people there must be a certain vulner@@ ability .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ list Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media after the killing of the black teen@@ ager &apos;s Tra@@ y@@ de Martin in 2012 , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in executive positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the main load of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; the movement is truly held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; in which Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of its identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sha@@ kes this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coinci@@ dence even though it was in front of the front because with a life at these junc@@ tions as a black , gay woman is so much in the game . &quot;
you can feel her energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long gone , but the racial ties between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on proof for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
yet she is cl@@ inging to a chant and she feels committed to this memory since she walked into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time .
&quot; but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone , since the first presentation 2009 , spl@@ its the population into advoc@@ ates and opponents . &quot;
&quot; cold , the subject hardly leaves one . &quot;
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while the one to the bit gallery say , &quot; That would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a human &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; during the pro@@ pon@@ ents that a gallery draws more customers into the city , from which the rest of the shops benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the farmer market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the construction work , it will end . &quot;
&quot; the gallery owners want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a place , with possibility to sit outside . &quot;
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been shopping almost weekly for many years in the Far@@ mers Market Hall .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm women are happy again and again . &quot;
we also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would like that even during and especially after the building of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
&quot; in other cities , there is that too . &quot;
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct market@@ ers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; however , this should not be very low in the new project . &quot;
Rezension : Hil@@ ary Mantel : &quot; bring Up the Bo@@ dies &quot;
&quot; clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is enough of this in our city .
one can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shops in a shopping m@@ all are only rented by larger companies , because the rent there are often not portable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; what a pity , specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the peasant market hall go down during the construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes .
or does the Ges@@ .@@ st Bit @-@ Gallery already manage to distribute all business from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that is simply not going to work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real peasant market instead of this gallery . &quot;
but there is no place for a peasant market hall thanks to the incredibly many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more .
&quot; when the farmer &apos;s market is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York a lot of faces can be seen - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ tible , hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ nau by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg who were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence analy@@ st banned a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after she was classified as secret diplomatic reports about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline involved her expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and dis@@ sident , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ tide has been created by algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA that was extracted by Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , the many ways that can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie where Mann@@ ing clearly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum bl@@ ond wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ nau joined the big success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ e@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ t and ch@@ ew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like . &quot;
this was the time they received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; she could not be photograph@@ ed at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use became un@@ equal brid@@ les which over the course of two years exchanged several letters .
&quot; they even created a comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the president ch@@ ats chel@@ ated judgment and would be able to personally see the exhibition . &quot;
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published to demand Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome type of happy meeting .
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong , as Donald Tr@@ ump is leading a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender soldiers to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to fl@@ ames the rigid divisions that he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a particular reason . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing with its over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is equipped with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic disper@@ sion , &quot; whose basis gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped , by incorpor@@ ating the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ides according to the highly developed scientific enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pa@@ edia of the artist ) , how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully bring about it is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , late Mem@@ ories , is also visible . &quot;
&quot; DNA dates can tell so many different stories , so the thirty of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition that is stored in a separate room is a page from the above Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
she shows that Mann@@ ing shows how she p@@ ops up with a free spre@@ e in his hand from the discipl@@ in@@ arian bar@@ racks of the United States as King Kong .
&quot; if they make your speech known , then they have won , &quot; &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ ose b@@ umps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - as it was supposed to be anticipated in the comic book - but if she was supposed to do it , then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ists , who assemble themselves like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also targeted as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing stat@@ ure ) , in which their genetic h@@ ap@@ log@@ ins were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted her to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was shaping up with Chelsea , like the movement that also stuck behind her liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an associate of Oxford University because of killing
&quot; a country @-@ wide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an Oxford University employee , looking for a susp@@ ect after a man was stab@@ bed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued an arrest warrant against murder on the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as evi@@ den@@ ced by Cook County &apos;s acts . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a common warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on July 27th .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries on his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the place of the event , and det@@ ectives investigating the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
she has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ pler , the Vice President for University Rel@@ ation@@ ships , said in an email explaining that La@@ them was now in a leave of absence and excluded from entering the campus of the North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal matter examined by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University collabor@@ ates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ elles . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a speaker from the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way .
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shock@@ ed and wanted him to be .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Office , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them rein@@ force , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help find susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was uncle@@ ar whether the incident took place on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; - Russian Vice @-@ President Mut@@ ko &quot;
Russian vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ setting R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the Organization &apos;s website .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on the alleged state @-@ supported dop@@ ing in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has collap@@ sed . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not give something that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ko &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with Russian sales agency r@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov made problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains disp@@ uted positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in November 2015 . &quot;
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the main artist of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA general director Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ USA@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; in order to be re @-@ used . &quot;
Al@@ di no longer sells eggs anymore
this divided the groups of companies .
&quot; it was a mere precau@@ tion , it could further be assumed by no health impair@@ ment , it was stated in the announcement . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative on fi@@ legs @-@ like anti @-@ stain sh@@ itt@@ el . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency with its customers .
&quot; the start @-@ ups , which will help your company not to become the next &quot;
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your employees in your e @-@ commerce startup , but the surveys didn &apos;t work . &quot;
&quot; answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful , or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised anon@@ ym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from outside to help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , provide special groups and demographic groups , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite leaders and contact the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the pursuit of their health , but where is Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
she said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel with G@@ lin@@ t during the three years .
&quot; in addition to the Sna@@ p surveys and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows which units have the most dis@@ comfort and which managers have low approval outcomes - so that you can re @-@ bore why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you will not be the next owner who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post , which describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this desire for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 according to the Financial Website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps prevent and detect poor behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amidst the U@@ ber case in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
applicants have recently registered as a client .
&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent company lets you send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive responses in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that employees can report about bad behavior .
&quot; and when the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regulator , &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that its employees are badly treated or un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and law@@ suits , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Con@@ ver@@ cent has used more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to trace the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company Con@@ ver@@ cent uses , problems that were previously identified by managers , who were sitting in offices in cities or states , can be identified and addressed faster , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair intern@@ s . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , managing the risk management group from Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment and legal disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry being online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and charge the companies with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products . &quot;
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors that have supported both startups .
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itter won $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing his entire funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , showing that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only stak@@ es . &quot;
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that their voices are heard and that the work they do is worthwhile , then they feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience by Link@@ ed@@ In , who used both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ tes when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
&quot; if the Analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ aker of a company does not take action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company very much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow , staff ask themselves , &quot; Have you really listened to me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; if you don &apos;t care about why , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now carries monthly surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day when a problem about G@@ lin@@ t is reported , so ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; with Ruby Tuesday , the company always gains new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in a long run , this leads to better bonding of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
&quot; it starts at 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA Foot@@ ball@@ players conver@@ se on one side of the new sports fields of the team on campus . &quot;
some have stri@@ pped off their tri@@ cot tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these hours are a lunch break . &quot;
players who are en@@ rolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the water man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 p.m .
&quot; this is a real tre@@ ad for the guys over the next three days , &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players . &quot;
the compromise weg from the two days is more than a day when the Brussels postpon@@ ed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as &apos;s six playing times in West@@ wood have performed practical exercises .
they are supposed to hold 18 exercises during the month of August . 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their kick @-@ off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supported the change in the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the multiple @-@ busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they just pushed it through , they plac@@ ed on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; U@@ C@@ LA will end its practice as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class , which has already been ej@@ ected with foot@@ balls , which is a barrier behind a door@@ post , will not be an easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video wall of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces at parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against fake news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake reports to third parties , and then display their results below the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false noti@@ fications and to send them to fact@@ sheets , which may display results of the fact check out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of whom believe that they have also influenced U.S. presidential elections 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany will support a plan to quickly eradic@@ ate hate @-@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook has announced in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories of fact @-@ reviewed third parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; &quot; related articles &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to his news feed to decrease false news . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970s and 1980s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has discovered 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now a inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &quot; covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , based on an archive : in 2014 , he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb @-@ print !
&quot; and letters always smell to smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the od@@ or has an effect as if he himself was there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is beaten with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome pit &quot; ) , it all seems too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vic@@ t@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ d@@ wat@@ chers on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape subjects , gardening and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
then at night he d@@ rank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust first received full access in 2006 when the last Er@@ am , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the Archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats &quot; said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; journals , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards depicting what was said : &quot; you might think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se yourself in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built Castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a rebellion that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &quot; &quot; Kni@@ ver@@ lightly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &quot; , &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot;
the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an insurrection was a good start .
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rol that the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l was portra@@ yed from the 18th century , who staged his own fun@@ eral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite a cro@@ ok , always pay debts and spend money on things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise . &quot;
after the end of his commitment in the castle Rho@@ des is looking for other unique writing experiences
&quot; he has taken a two @-@ week stay in Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed from nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to get ready again with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle cover@@ ies in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the envel@@ oping of the 301 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; by Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and slogan secret . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , there will be a celebration on the island Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on their last activated web page . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Honne@@ fer understand the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ in @-@ one promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique feature . &quot;
&quot; finally , it stands in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
the city of Bad Honnef is an average five @-@ digit figure that will cost its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on retirement and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
so also this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the attempted put@@ sch .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as in the past but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the Heads of State , the five vice @-@ ministers as well as the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the over@@ population . &quot;
the government tigh@@ tens the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the na@@ vy were shut down . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , Erd@@ og@@ an has fired upon Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of the 326 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged ties to the movement of the Ex@@ ile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erd@@ og@@ an sees as the wi@@ dow of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people , who were allegedly involved in the attempted put@@ sch , will be negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an had called the overthrow of the &quot; God @-@ Gift , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to completely clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erd@@ og@@ an really have the army under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading of &quot; dis@@ comfort in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the general staff there are concerns because of an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself among other things in the lifting of the head@@ scarf ban for female soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the bulk cleaning in the army and the security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July Erd@@ og@@ an agreed to fire more 73@@ 95 national servants per decree , among them 230@@ 3 police officers and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as if Erd@@ og@@ an t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly known as the lords of the country .
&quot; three times , they pushed them into their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order . &quot;
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 Erd@@ og@@ an pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform plans of the European Union . &quot;
former officers argue Erd@@ og@@ an is specifically pushing forward an Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; in the &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; magazine , a particularly un@@ named officer , who was seeking asylum after the attempted coup attempt in foreign countries , warned that the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such development could not let N@@ ato be cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , in the alliance after the pur@@ ges , there is doubt about the readiness of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes rules for Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration policy to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media . &quot;
&quot; he plans to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill will be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the US the way citizens from other countries will issue Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to san@@ to track for road bus shuttle
&quot; again and again , over the past few months , the future of the race has been fought - now it should go quite fast . &quot;
&quot; just before the end of the year , it is supposed to be built at the ailing route on which the tourist track runs . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the Renn@@ stei@@ sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work will start on the track this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and to rehab@@ ilit@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country comm@@ its itself to this important connection , especially for tourism , &quot; stated secretary secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the cost of shor@@ tening the route was estimated at around 2.5 million euros .
&quot; of this sum , the land sur@@ passes 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future from the country , is currently being voted definitive , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the South Thuring@@ ian Rail@@ ways as an operator are already unanim@@ ous about the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negoti@@ ated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this meant that the racing stei@@ g shuttle was to be ordered on a regular basis in December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is a popular rail link between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; in recent months , it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation , whether the route is used by a large number of people to order it in the future . &quot;
the track is also very b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought that 2017 cannot be any more crazy , a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots comes from . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big deal .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of FR@@ R , we must start taking up their ascen@@ sion seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of ni@@ pple and the type of finger@@ nail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun about them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone membrane that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also customize his robot according to his beliefs , and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his finger@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; but it will be more distur@@ bing as many robots have the &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; that would make a Step@@ ford woman look progressive . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots with a silicone corne@@ a .
&quot; the Real@@ Amb@@ ix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robot developed by True Compan@@ ion , with pre@@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adv@@ entu@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; he@@ ats the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - quite like real people !
&quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation , or she can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many wor@@ rying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the all@@ usions to rape , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : opposed ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ b one the most . &quot;
&quot; on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy is compatible with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xy ? &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot;
their emergence and their increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional enc@@ ore .
&quot; most men will of course not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notic@@ e@@ zes their rising popularity , they remain nonetheless at the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what le@@ aks out of the boundary zones , in relation to the spirit of time in which we live , can be very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
and many people are not stran@@ gely or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission to do so .
&quot; there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time in which the rights of women are threatened all over the world , in which there is a president in the White House that has bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the most det@@ err@@ ent aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the ent@@ win@@ ed body and the stu@@ ffed eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical lik@@ eness to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human@@ ely that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background story , nothing that suggests independence or anything , which might distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleasing slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the phrase of 2017 : maid
tr@@ umps Great Performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a rush of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions , which pol@@ arized the US voters , also split families in small @-@ format . &quot;
around Christmas and thank@@ s@@ giving there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we are all supposed to meet all of us to place our filter bub@@ bles .
less noticed is the power of tr@@ umps to bring together families .
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship with which they had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; around the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it is in a further context that this also brings significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the issu@@ ing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; and &quot; Tr@@ ump , &quot; we refer to the stup@@ end@@ ous possibility that one day his bi@@ bs will no longer be b@@ ump@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; however , there is still a start@@ ling long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tr@@ ump Republi@@ can of the right wing , which suddenly appears as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards . &quot;
&quot; today , I think of an active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ com@@ ical version of the decline - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked out ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact seem to be a very mild criminal . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify as un@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ousel in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ ousel in the New York park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need a caff@@ eine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ p and the animals twi@@ sted to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clim@@ ati@@ cal music im@@ parts this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite busy throughout the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the them@@ ed pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage doesn &apos;t count - but a large round@@ about in northern London . &quot;
&quot; but Central Park @-@ car@@ ousel is still a strange magical experience , as here two @-@ year old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and have all a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could rate the car@@ ousel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , during this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this leads not only to a slow@@ down of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation where no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing terri@@ bly , while I was tired of the experience to reach my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year he was hospit@@ alized because of the treatment of cuts on his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to the prison authorities in one case in his cell . &quot;
&quot; for murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors . &quot;
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by sha@@ king her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pre@@ toria on her .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girl@@ friend for a no@@ c@@ turn@@ al intru@@ der , hiding in the cab . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal to the six @-@ year prison term of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say it is too short @-@ si@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Inves@@ tigation Department said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ t@@ ank@@ ers from F@@ utzen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and in the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students go to secondary school in the future , four at the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , teacher Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; as a symbol of school release , the 29 students of the four classes elected under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , a young eagle that grows in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar introduced a musical with the title &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ cken &apos;s Cour@@ tyard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and caused it to out@@ breed it from its h@@ ens .
&quot; instead of a ch@@ ick@@ ens , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of him was struck , the eagle spread forth his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore . &quot;
&quot; after that , classes showed three and four in the rehear@@ sing of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln that bore Cy@@ linders to the bet .
&quot; the eagle stands for integration , &quot; &quot; said school director Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the young is different from the other young ( ch@@ icks ) , but belonged to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
she desired every four @-@ leg@@ ged friend that he feels accepted in his new school .
&quot; followed by thanks to the colleagues , the former teacher Michael Müller , who always jumps into teaching pas@@ sports , and the parent representatives . &quot;
&quot; the kitchen time is over now , declared class teacher Sophia Schumacher . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , she would not leave her students very much , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ party @-@ äss@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all students left a song of sum@@ mer@@ time and holiday time . &quot;
with the children great joy broke out .
eight first@@ - äss@@ ler are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians due to illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal people were arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the State Department reported B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camp and put anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose significant fin@@ es .
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for Diesel Cars : what suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
must diesel drivers take part in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they should improve the emission of emissions from cars of emissions classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ ted from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action compulsory ?
no . the software updates tra@@ ded are optional .
&quot; the obligatory updates before are valid only for the vehicles , the che@@ ating software , &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
their retro@@ fitting was ordered by the Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed of updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation over the next few months , but not yet called an exact date . &quot;
Daimler told us to write to each person affected .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done within the framework . &quot;
how long should the conver@@ sions take place altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
it depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as the political pressure .
&quot; as we have seen , autom@@ akers have not acted on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be an appointment .
&quot; what are drivers driving a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ? &quot;

ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump is promising to become political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center awards .
&quot; as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the scholars . &quot;
the awards are handed over at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will receive a reception and attend the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
the prize winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series was already announced to refra@@ in from attending the gala .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided not to negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and that bur@@ dens me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to make clear her view . &quot;
&quot; the Kennedy @-@ Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the biggest cultural institution in the U.S. capital . &quot;
&quot; previous prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city worth living
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will go to retirement next year . &quot;
&quot; the place is already written out , however , suitable candidates are rare . &quot;
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a master builder for 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun as he teaches in the press room .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , he wonder@@ ed that so far no application has fulfilled the requirements profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or a civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
this should - taking notice of the regular periods of notice - must still be enough time for a revision .
&quot; as Has@@ lach functions for the Administr@@ ative Community as a Sub @-@ Building Law Authority , the applicant must prescri@@ be appropriate degrees . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would not be able to fill it out again , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation . &quot;
&quot; but citizen clos@@ eness is important to the city and himself , says W@@ acker , who reports of a good working climate and good sen@@ timent among authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back to the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; he is confident about the building office and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ zzo and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking lot are about to be found . &quot;
&quot; the Kin@@ zig Bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , but the stadium renovation is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter will be be@@ ating with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my success@@ ors . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; designed for a city @-@ builder , there is ample room for manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; with Has@@ lach &apos;s own farm and gar@@ dener , many things can be re@@ acted flexibly . &quot;
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often referred to by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the separ@@ ator Stadt@@ bau@@ meister emphas@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the urban builder bears high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; in the end everything is running here over my table . &quot;
&quot; he can count on many years of co @-@ operation with regard to support and coordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing this for ten years , Manfred Scho@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also that his successor stay long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who truly identifies and wants to stay with the spot . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you want to be buried by Roland W@@ acker , a completed course of studies as a diploma engineer or a bach@@ el@@ or with subject of architecture should have a degree in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction planning law . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ( Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ) stands for civil and civil engineering , building control planning , dig@@ res@@ sions , administration of municipal property , Municipal Farm with Bau@@ hof and Stadt@@ gar@@ dener , as well as Unter@@ e Building Law , including monument protection . &quot;
bicycle on leads thrown : Süd@@ bahn@@ track closed
&quot; according to the police , the hitherto unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike from the railway track over the Le@@ ob@@ last Street ( B@@ 116 ) to the leader@@ ships . &quot;
these were damaged so heavily that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them since the night hours .
&quot; near the crime scene , witnesses of a sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver were observed by witnesses . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a prosper@@ ous campus , &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot;
the or the perpet@@ rators themselves would have brought themselves into great danger and also endangered the train traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the equipment , as well as the delay and the cost of rail transport , there could also be p@@ ön@@ ing of the railway customers to the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; overall , from a &quot; substantial &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damage had been repaired on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the south rail route could be led without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; nearly ten passenger trains were off Friday morning , two of them covered distance traffic . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not fall out , but they delayed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help alle@@ vi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammation ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; but a new study claims just the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United States , causes stomach cr@@ amps and blo@@ oms , recur@@ rent or bloody di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , weight loss , and extreme ti@@ red@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; while those affected are usually advised to ste@@ er meat and dairy products to rel@@ ieve their symptoms , researchers found at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol in order to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the meal do not penetrate into the body . &quot;
cells which are able to trigger inflamm@@ ations are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging sensitive tissues .
&quot; if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments were found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell is found in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to destroy the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an diet that is rich in tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an promotes toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lie@@ us when the same system works with people . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan investig@@ ates a kind of immune cell that fo@@ sters tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , but which had not had this . &quot;
&quot; it susp@@ ects that the difference between the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced DNA sequ@@ encing and there were found six bacterial species present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice . &quot;
mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that they failed to develop an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they got the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria developed on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i left in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an metabolism known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an in the feed of the mice , the number of cells increased by around 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an@@ values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells dropped by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells such as mice and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i can protect in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal tracts .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an@@ values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
&quot; at Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut at S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound description of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup begins on Tuesday , and impres@@ ses in the role of the holder , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira march to Bel@@ i@@ eben . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic had been exp@@ elled from the pre @-@ preparation Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had to improve before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho expressed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had three more new obligations , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four primary obligations . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , for that I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have given great difficulty . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner into the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing discovered the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in Washington State Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner about the U.S. , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a stamina test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
in this way the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ Logo were painted in the sky .
&quot; new deep beat for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , Social Democratic Prime Minister had always looked at Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only there was no stor@@ ehouse of the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation - so was the most important wish of the election fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the staff from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House witnessed the events in the state capitals of the SPD with a growing horror . &quot;
&quot; what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with head@@ wind . &quot;
it was grav@@ itation .
and one by one .
&quot; after the astonishing end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this once again shows : red @-@ green can simply not go@@ vern reliable &quot; , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the Supreme Leader of a Green Party member has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
&quot; five months before the Parliament election , its red @-@ green coalition thus lost its One @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens Federal Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner asked El@@ ke T@@ westen in Lower Saxony to give her mandate back .
the transition to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen immediately needs to give back her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Administr@@ ative Officer and election campaign of the Gre@@ ens to the editorial Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true at all , &quot; &quot; an SPD comb@@ at@@ ant si@@ gh@@ s , when the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ b@@ ans have reached the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the revision of the green dep@@ u@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to CD@@ U without his own government majority . &quot;
it is the provisional climax of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the misery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades cal@@ med down . &quot;
&quot; after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
&quot; that became , and indeed , everything was much worse . &quot;
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into pi@@ geon , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te breath@@ ed the party smooth . &quot;
the com@@ rade sw@@ elled again in the weeks afterwards .
&quot; then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg arrived . &quot;
and with him came the next deep beat .
&quot; mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his ni@@ b@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because in crisis communication , he made so much everything wrong , what one can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for its political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; due to the VW @-@ exhaust aff@@ aires and its role in the supervisory board , the Dutch Prime Minister already stood in criticism for some time . &quot;
mi@@ ese Query assets were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely why , in recent weeks , Wei@@ l attempted to set acc@@ ents more and more strongly in the league . &quot;
&quot; the ambition of the former mayor of Hanover to expand its power in Berlin , too , was not hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they left him as they spoke of Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; in this context , Because of the non @-@ party co@@ er@@ ci@@ on of the Lower Saxony , there is no fault at all . &quot;
and Schulz does not at all .
&quot; meanwhile , comrades , the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the back@@ sliding parliam@@ ent@@ arians of T@@ westen . &quot;
&quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen places her own car@@ eers over the interests of everyone else , &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ westen has not been elected to parliament because of her person as a direct candidate , but on the national list of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens , the parliament of Lower Saxony . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins of an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vot@@ er willingness four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a candidate candidate to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member distor@@ ts the election result , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been ongoing commitments of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
grants for Top@@ ics III
who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of ST@@ EG &apos;s urban development were informed on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what happened so far . &quot;
since 1991 there have been sensi@@ tivities in the refur@@ bish@@ ment areas .
&quot; back then , in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is important to promote inner development , and not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot;
on April 4 we received the information from the District of Karlsruhe to give the information that there will be a restructuring area III .
&quot; the sum amounts to 8@@ 33 333 Euros , including 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest of the municipality &apos;s sensi@@ tivities . &quot;
how is a remedi@@ ation area now created ?
&quot; one will , as Sch@@ ind@@ ler continue to investigate , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area any interest exists , to rehab@@ ilit@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the regional borders could then be moved again . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday evening , ST@@ EC represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday night . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the Federal State @-@ La@@ ender programme &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; , &quot; in which the restructuring would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is revit@@ alization of inner cities , improving residential and working conditions , and maintaining and expanding infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , i.e. per plot . &quot;
the restructuring area would then finally be established as a set of rules .
&quot; since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 , the deadline for the promotion has been valid until 30 April 2026 . &quot;
&quot; until September of this year , however , the stock intake would be carried out only once , as part of those involved in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area to fill a questionna@@ ire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the Statutes of the association should take place , so that in the coming year the restructuring can begin . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that each municipality had to carry out the said Vor@@ ab surveys .
it is about evaluating and determining the urban developments and to decide when it is rehab@@ ilit@@ ated and to what extent .
&quot; for the respective site , there will be a re@@ mark in the land register . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come back to sensi@@ bility again and get a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Got@@ zel stressed , a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , there will be questionna@@ ires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and to be completed by the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionna@@ ire is the &quot; &quot; building and real estate &quot; , &quot; in which it deals with the structural condition and the renovation projects . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionna@@ ire , the &quot; &quot; budget and housing &quot; , &quot; information about size , layout and residents of a living room can be made . &quot;
the blue &quot; operational bow &quot; can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building .
&quot; however , it must be noted that a completed questionna@@ ire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler pointed out that the distribution of funds according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; function - who comes first , grin@@ ds first . &quot;
&quot; there cannot be any fund@@ ings for later &quot; &quot; reservation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the end , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Top@@ ics II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; renovation project . &quot;
British invent@@ or uses a micro@@ chip for himself to get into house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door@@ step , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and foref@@ inger and now offers service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ist at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedures are carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs implant@@ ated micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all at a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the value costs of the White House cost thousands of tax@@ pa@@ yers
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a na@@ val helicop@@ ter to the South La@@ wn for an event that lifts American production last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military &apos;s specifications , which were left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to USD 24.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a yacht made of Ma@@ ine , a fire engine from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft from Mississi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the Military Office of the White House requested the presence of the helicop@@ ter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the recordings of the marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his super@@ visor , the deputy mar@@ in@@ ator for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the news that the helicop@@ ter arrived on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 p.m. and so long , until the grass was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening . &quot;
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would be required for the return flight .
&quot; the original flight crew was at the helicop@@ ter during the event , while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the ground . &quot;
the recordings provided by TI@@ ME were not clear whether a second flight was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits the Federal Government to use state property for political purposes .
datas@@ ets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the purpose .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the commander wrote . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; the Deputy Command@@ ant replied . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event was called the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus to reform the health reform , which was going on in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
the use of the air@@ plane known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes .
pres@@ idents shall be obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ surgery is unusual .
&quot; in February , Tr@@ ump has conducted an investigation as the presidential jet on the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Ta@@ xi@@ mer@@ maid service , and his Twitter account is full of reports compla@@ ining about the use of the presidential jet on his predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the Show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently carry training flights around Washington and South La@@ wn to reduce U.S. President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
&quot; as Tr@@ ump in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 carried out 58 practice land@@ ings at the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted for the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a official . &quot;
helicop@@ ter units additionally flew 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pa@@ yers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicop@@ ter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have bud@@ get@@ ary names for the Pres@@ idential F@@ lights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D refund set for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot;
records of unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicop@@ ter lie far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual resources . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ icer , defended the use of the helicop@@ ter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present this week things made in America , &quot; said Sp@@ icer . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize this . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicop@@ ter when he entered his tour across the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire fighter . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump was talking to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
pione@@ ers of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ liga compete at the Tab@@ ulated Advanced Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
the TC Blau @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will start tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel near Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
&quot; despite having five games still fla@@ w@@ less , the top runner of the Second Tennis League has gotten the sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay in any case has respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , which is always played in quite similar formation . &quot;
especially on the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability in the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV , the imports from the high north take care especially . &quot;
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to assignments in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay looking at Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ la@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is becoming hard for us . &quot;
you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; at the moment at the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fr@@ ench@@ man , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) will be playing in the tournament in the Czech Republic Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) for the first time in this season . &quot;
&quot; the so far un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo , yesterday with the White Russia An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky , was on the ball at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el . &quot;
&quot; but he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories last Sunday against the club on the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could also move into the team . &quot;
&quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hung@@ arians , who was the number one of the Junior World Ran@@ king in January 2016 , not filling the cad@@ re on Mari@@ us Z@@ ay &apos;s staff . &quot;
how America can harm the OM@@ V
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy , when he set his signature on Wednesday evening under the law of tigh@@ tening sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in his refusal to en@@ act the law , the Congress estimated a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels sp@@ elled against the U.S. kick @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft plan to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors of the Austrian OM@@ V , who jointly with other European companies have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea ei@@ tung North Stream 2 . &quot;
the threat is enormous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil corporation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would even have to raise the sanctions by executive order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
the press &quot; looked at which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him .
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the heart of the charts of Net@@ fli@@ x
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ Bar Killer un@@ vei@@ ls , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is not yet over . &quot;
&quot; the seasons three and four have already been confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show . &quot;
&quot; in the third season , DE@@ A has focused attention on the rich@@ est organization of the drug trade in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 &quot; only with more state records and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Alc@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) comm@@ its the Mexican association , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to Ja@@ vier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support war on drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are Mati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ vest@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
roll back : the town turns 46 kitchen hel@@ pers
the town re@@ organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock will be rep@@ atri@@ ated in the city &apos;s day@@ care centers .
&quot; on 1 September , the city of Kre@@ feld took over food supplies in the city &apos;s day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , bo@@ iled out of house : a cat@@ erer under@@ takes this task and delivers freshly cooked ch@@ illed . &quot;
&quot; the city operates 46 day@@ care centers in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; during the past kit@@ esur@@ fing year 28@@ 00 children were sitting at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children , who are looked after 45 hours of the week , have lunch in the K@@ ita , explains Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care if children stay until 2 pm .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time employees have kitchen service from 1 September : they pre@@ heat the delivered food , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruits , por@@ tioned the meal individually , clean up the meal , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a ch@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as si@@ ze@@ able units - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
so they are much more integrated and it is easier for kit@@ esur@@ fing to implement peda@@ gog@@ ical concepts .
because that &apos;s why it &apos;s about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
the children should help prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen forces - will in future be settled by special cleaning staff .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also the charm that it turned out in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign distribution for the city as the most economical one , is it from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time employees are re@@ hired . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so strong for about 750 people in the area of education , &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , an am@@ ending leader of the UN mission , said that hundreds of women are candidates in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be really representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and presidential elections take place on 5 April .
&quot; the Taliban has published threats against a choice trial , which coinci@@ des with the transition from international martial arts to an advisory role . &quot;
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will take place peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ om said , a strong role for women will rein@@ force Afghanistan &apos;s democratic success . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of more than 3.6 million voters .

two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
&quot; according to information from the police , the men told the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who talked to friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2.@@ 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone . &quot;
the 13 year old refused the request but continued with her friends .

without prey the duo escaped .
the two young men were later arrested by the police .
the investigation runs .
G@@ MB concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a trade union wants to make certain the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ on location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which , in addition to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cu@@ its are produced . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; first experienced &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s director , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s called on &quot; concerns &quot; concerns that financing for modernis@@ ation of production lines is not pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the work forces concentrate heavily on the local community and the big city of Glasgow , an important pillar for decent work in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the director at T@@ oll@@ on received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it as we value the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ y@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we work like all companies operating in a highly competitive and in@@ secure business climate , constantly checking our business - and this applies to all of our business units and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; over the last few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ on location , in particular in production lines and operative improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ y@@ cross as a production site full and full . if our operations are changing at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the side of La Liga may be interested in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; in their pursuit of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave after having issued an offer of £ 189 million to dis@@ solve its release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the collapse of the world ? &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , even though a source is close to the Catalan leader , that the club always has its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this prospect ?
&quot; when Manchester City was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact them , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association expressing interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ ot@@ ers dis@@ car@@ ded and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown do@@ er deliberately kick@@ ed off a sco@@ oter in the royal court street in front of the estate number 30 and so on the fair@@ ing of the vehicle caused a damage of more than 200 euros . &quot;
&quot; police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 0@@ 74@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for notes . &quot;
the police are looking for an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
&quot; because he got a car in his lane , the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to ev@@ ade and touch the crash barrier . &quot;
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW was coming from Stol@@ zen@@ au at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese .
&quot; in the area of the reloc@@ ation of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane , so he had to turn right . &quot;
the Tour@@ an driver touched the crash barrier .
&quot; in the passenger car , property damage was created . &quot;
&quot; the driver of the passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident victims , it can be good that the accident @-@ driver had not noticed the accident at all . &quot;
&quot; the police now ask for witnesses of the case , as well as the driver of the cause of the cause , to contact the Commissioner in Stol@@ zen@@ au under Tel . + 49 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 . &quot;
&quot; interview : &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; report relief by Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases is reli@@ eved by Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ person for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after publication against the German press agency , he was expecting from the former R@@ atz@@ inger Bishop and today Cardinal R. R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ ted Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
it would serve to serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger express their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or their false estimate of events at that time .
&quot; the Vatican paper &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; on the other hand critici@@ zed that in reporting on violence against the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; two levels &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in regard to the attacks in Regensburg , nobody doubts that it is &quot; &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful actions &quot; &quot; that would be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ pon@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk , prin@@ cess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said : &quot; you like to go to the church and that is a prisoner of food . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; blows a very normal peda@@ gog@@ ical means &quot; were &quot; &quot; to be done with friends of children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in the context of reports on abuse , pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger summar@@ ized the mem@@ or@@ and@@ um &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report commissioned by the bish@@ op@@ ric Regensburg with the enligh@@ tenment commissioned by Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that the master of the cathedral was used in many cases of physical and mental violence . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be more intense . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , unlike many other accused , many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories are linked to him in numerous cases . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence at the R@@ ins of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , many students highlight his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became tangible to the latter when a domain record musi@@ cally did not bring top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ever occurs in it . &quot;
only eight pages are devoted to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also occurred outside of its sphere of activity .
&quot; at best , it is possible to repro@@ ach him not to experience it too late or to have taken first hints not seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , on which it worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents - as literally - &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; thus , the vast majority of his disciples Georg R@@ atz@@ inger publishes an excellent testimony , describes him as &quot; warm @-@ heart@@ ed , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers , who regularly provided the boys with cakes , bis@@ cu@@ its and cand@@ y and &quot; always moved from grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also sometimes led to wi@@ dening brothers . &quot;
&quot; he did not only kne@@ ad with chairs and threw the key@@ boards on the ground , but also gave ear tips and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he himself had already given years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with what this report actually deals , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are dig@@ ni@@ ties . &quot;
one wonders if it is not more likely to do with his acquaint@@ ance and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI that many media have just pl@@ ung@@ ed to him .
&quot; in the Bavarian Pope , many people who have never understood him are still working ze@@ al@@ ously . &quot;
but the truth is : the report relief Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in the context of the report , the media reported a great deal about abuse in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger placed in the final report also any involvement or cooperation with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the cathedral master .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or my mother about it , &quot; &quot; said one of the suffer@@ ers for the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot;
the real problem in the clari@@ fication of sexual abuse was and is that most of the victims are silent .
&quot; if they do not even entr@@ ust their parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , certainly not a choir director , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ r@@ ator professionally . &quot;
how do the scratch @-@ cats do R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a questioned student formulated it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he would have had timely knowledge ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have stopped the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that it was ac@@ counted for him ... boys more urgent or clear@@ er or rather opened than towards their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers , etc . &quot;
that one talks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; thus , the report con@@ cludes with the very clear result : &quot; that the students and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance , could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus exemp@@ ted from any cooperation . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he cannot be accused of preventing or having taken him to an ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to connect his good name to these contra@@ sting crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; violence ex@@ iles &quot; was to be read in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the former cathedral master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is presented in the report &quot; Rem@@ over . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed up in the reporting has become a huge det@@ our of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but exactly this is again an abuse of the report .
&quot; namely , it is clean : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the grammar school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence and , we say once , other accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report covers incidents from time since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous test peda@@ gog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were properly chi@@ pped and painted , all happened at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail . &quot;
&quot; but with those he had nothing to do with the cathedral master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for he only got to face the boys when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , like most of the witnesses , the subject of &quot; primary school &quot; was tab@@ oo . &quot;
one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was indeed discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report con@@ cludes that &quot; many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even positive memories with him in numerous cases . &quot;
at most at most the repro@@ ach remains to have st@@ owed away .
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school , where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then only around 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger strictly shut the ears off the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , which the report even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out to him , &quot; that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool , the prison sentence will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended an urgent intervention . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , when Prü@@ fer &apos;s pun@@ ish@@ ments were banned in Bavaria long ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , it occurred in a legal grey area , as each one of us knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to estimate , where the affected persons might be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where really the permitted limit had been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; however , one cannot say that he had always looked away . &quot;
this is simply not correct .
only in 1980 the re@@ alty of schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis said , it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the time . &quot;
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; sn@@ are of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; that is , the risk of evaluating past moral standards . &quot;
the prin@@ cess has already been right .
&quot; but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able at all times , and not for what was found in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the then usual . &quot;
that &apos;s all very aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it will finally work up .
but at the same time I must protect Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all this had nothing to do with him .
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing the ears and ears , thus far widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then prohibited , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
&quot; which picture of his Regen@@ s@@ burger Zeit has given Georg R@@ atz@@ inger once again in talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the subject of Prü@@ m Pen@@ alty also come to speech ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells from his perspective , that the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I did not deny that he held a strict reg@@ iment there . &quot;
&quot; but this has to be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of Wel@@ tran@@ g , true cultural amb@@ ass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cu@@ its and cand@@ y alone one does not make a big singer from rebel@@ li@@ ous boys and stand before every success , no matter in which area , but always discipline , passion and overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in talks with her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through work on the book and beyond , I really got to know George R@@ atz@@ inger and again and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , gra@@ cious , deeply believing and aff@@ ection@@ ate people , from whom one could not imagine that he could do something else just a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly get in touch with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are still today , 23 years after his emig@@ ration , regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; for those who have not for@@ given him until today , that he was once strict to them , they are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are thank@@ ful to him today that he en@@ riches their lives and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he was always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely resp@@ ect@@ ful person , to which they still look and hon@@ oring them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again very clearly : everything you repro@@ ach him are educational methods that were then on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long since overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just released , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the starting point would resort , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without those outside Bavaria and perhaps no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
