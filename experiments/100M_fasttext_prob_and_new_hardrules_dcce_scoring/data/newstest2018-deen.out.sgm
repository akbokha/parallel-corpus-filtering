<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt where young people are supposed to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A chapel that is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys if maps are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows everybody who had to get upset because the car nav was showing a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geopolis Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but current - but very enlightening."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patchwork that is not recognized immediately.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the large overview card was drawn up for towns and communities with more detailed maps, so called" "Urination leaves". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"these were created according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864, and the first surveying was Bayerns."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon desired an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops ended up with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavarian map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV. Joseph pushed the project forward, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The certificate of composition for Munich originates from the year 1856 and is to be found like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the comparison of former / today, in the example of the state capital, is most impressive."</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, in the district of Munich."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was first named after 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasant rebellion against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, nothing can be seen as fields - at first glance: in the zoom zoom a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered bottles from the so-called" Ursus "from which the land was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"small plots no longer show farmers there, but small gardeners of the" "Land in Sun" "plant."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, since 1810 arena of the October test, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other hand of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen area, one reads not only the street name" "at the Gasteig" "or from the address" "Auf der Lüften" "- but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at Auerfeldstraße, one once locked people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there was the district" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "in 1858 / 59."</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed up the institution - the psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the charges of so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"he also forbids the personnel to use violence against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients, there was first place, later it was expanded to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-Amper Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists."</seg>
<seg id="40">At the site of the former Auer Anstalt young people now meet in Salesianum in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">"the football field of the TSV München east is located west, east residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" "Casa Don Bosco" "was erected in architectural references to the country of origin of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed during World War II in bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed as" "main square" "around 1856, the shopping destination was called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies broke out many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once on the Marienhof, where these days were preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizen Rights Group publishes Travel Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for Coloring Farming has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state Missouri, which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls for afro-american travelers, visitors and Missourians to take special attention while travelling through the state and be noted here," said the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently passed law of Missouri, which makes people harder to win discrimination complaints, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to publish the travel warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, which happen to people."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents like racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no gasoline anymore while travelling by the state and taken into custody by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also pointed out to a recently published report by the Governor General of Missouri, in which it is shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People must be prepared to bring cowrie money or let relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri posted 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's crime series reporting program, which ranks the state with respect to the number of such violations of the 16th position of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warning for Texas and Arizona after the states agreed to arrest the local prosecution authorities to arrest people for immigration rules, which will contribute to the view of ACLU on further road profile."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warning is usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Weidezaunprojekt is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fishermen Weidecaun Project is a successful project and will be continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The members of the CDU member Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac provided a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the right-grabbing court of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbach CDU-Ortsverband, together with mayor Thomas Schneider, met with the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first granted insight into his farm, in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals, and accommodated in five apartments Feriengäste."</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "black-zwaldmilk" "is for him an alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengäste comes exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also a BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he called the Weidezaunprojekt as" elementary. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot work profitable on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"green land care for a lot of work, a lot must be worked with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight with the conditions and topography here," "stressed Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if he did not conduct a bioeconomy."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leadership. "</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers should be supported at cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the reforestation of the areas could be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they continue their operations," the mayor stressed. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers stand in critiques because of the encouragement</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 via the electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="85">"this covers 40 hectares, which must not be enforested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"half of the total costs in the amount of 71 500 Euros were funded by leaders, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischerbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers remained 12 610 Euro, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac said:" "you do a really good job without farmers and rural women."</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter Weiss:" "best food is produced here." ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscape preservation line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a conveying environment designated by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the enclosed area may not be mintudeable (slope gradient of 35 percent) and must thus be threatened by the reforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the 2018 fisherman's Weidezaunprojekt 2018 the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the maintenance area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans value this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN on the President's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to be fair, Miller didn't handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imitators would have punched him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he touched its significance, and in particular the meaning it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta," "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world."</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is properly speaking, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the angry words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your rubbish, your poor, / your afflicted masses, who yearn to breathe freely, the wailing drop of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "elent waste" was better seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict on the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural dispute: it is in fact a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the basis of their death at the base - knew very well that they took a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">"the sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism, portraying female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical illustration."</seg>
<seg id="114">"Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has received a voice."</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the Exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty is no one, but rather an early Neocon, bringing the American flame to the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty is proceeding. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not light the way into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">"quite unusual, Limbaugh is found here on something."</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is completely and even a question of the point of perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">It is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not light the way, but ignite hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black lodges Scottish members of the Great Britain team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the United Kingdom's athletics, Neil Black, states that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Championships" will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, starting on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "something special is developed in Scotland" and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue to figure it out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that there is something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are Medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butacker - who will compete against Sir Mon Farah at the 5,000 m distance while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team to the team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is rather modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captain's speech was incredible," "says Black."</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought, of course, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver medal winner, who will compete with her fifth world championships at the 400-m hurdles, states that it is" unbelievable "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes in the World Championship was seven in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-distance runner Muir leads along this road and has installed five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part at the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1.500 m, is another Scotsman to watch the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games after a great season."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is remembering her first World Championships as the only other Scotsman in the Lee McConnell team.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" enormously proud "of the fact that many of their countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will also be involved in medals and finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me, makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb up on platforms."</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">"I have only indicated that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship."</seg>
<seg id="158">It is therefore really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blockage of Critics via Facebook: don't work for a public office if you can't tolerate the natives of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything from the domestic policy to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he shouted with criticism, surely."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid, and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">"Hogans's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people, who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with" "Na". ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," "said many people."</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary skyhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has demonstrated a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to play backlash his hairy head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side, which is a public forum that is designated as official and by employees paid with public tax dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, the spokeswoman Amelia Chasse praised the governor's actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hassfilled people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail addressed with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people speaking with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not stuffed, but she asked for hate crime."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment section of "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a stand on the same subject, they are considered by some rather than a so-called collective employment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the Governor of the Governor designated as" "concentrated spam attack" "would probably call" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or removing a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, if one would have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical loaders and to arrest and silence the demonstrators."</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County passed the First Amendment, according to US District Judges James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at Washington's time, the time of affordable portoltos had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplies between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writer knocked on his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"people who used pseudonyms such as" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his ministry, according to historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not give them silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses belong to the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guidance means accepting this.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club</seg>
<seg id="207">"the former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort over the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian organized the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open."</seg>
<seg id="208">"the Nordire, who last year in the Archerfield left to Endrunde, before he lost Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador for the name of the association founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi."</seg>
<seg id="209">"I saw how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how he achieved fame with this event," said Rafferty. "</seg>
<seg id="210">"the players will see this course from its best side, it's in a great state."</seg>
<seg id="211">Jerry did a great job as he established that place.</seg>
<seg id="212">He is a zealous advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.</seg>
<seg id="213">This is a great showcase for this course. "</seg>
<seg id="214">"the English Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although in his 32-year career he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour."</seg>
<seg id="215">"this really feels very special," "said the player based in Southport."</seg>
<seg id="216">"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year, after I won them."</seg>
<seg id="217">Coming back to this part of the world is magical.</seg>
<seg id="218">It is a wonderful place to play golf.</seg>
<seg id="219">"the memories of last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year."</seg>
<seg id="220">It was a really special time and one we will always appreciate.</seg>
<seg id="221">"Gary Orr, who, after his 50th birthday, came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year, returns to the action on the home floor."</seg>
<seg id="222">This event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="223">"it always means a little bit more when you play at home," "said Orr, the man from Helensburgh."</seg>
<seg id="224">"you want to do it well, but you also feel this additional pressure."</seg>
<seg id="225">I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf.</seg>
<seg id="226">I'm glad about how it went.</seg>
<seg id="227">"the former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty."</seg>
<seg id="228">"ORR and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance belong to the six Scots in the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond."</seg>

<seg id="251">"after half an hour, the charred anolle is removed and devoured with zealous, unwashed hands."</seg>
<seg id="252">Degei sits on the clay - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work such as dresses with water from the nearby marsh.</seg>
<seg id="253">A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.</seg>
<seg id="254">"as the youngest of the four wives of her husband, no fields were assigned to her."</seg>
<seg id="255">Polygamy is customary here.</seg>
<seg id="256">"of course it can be dangerous to work late: most villagers are unemployed, and many are heavy drinking, and there are the soldiers here."</seg>
<seg id="257">"nobody dares to run around in the village after 5 pm," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="258">"it is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 Elders were to vote in front of the occupying forces."</seg>
<seg id="259">"an existing movement, which stirred up independence against the Dutch regime, quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains the control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers."</seg>
<seg id="260">"in 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, and the independent part of Papua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island."</seg>

<seg id="269">Papua is Indonesia's poorest province where 28% of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst children mortality and literacy rates in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="270">But it is also Indonesia's Goldland.</seg>
<seg id="271">"the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="272">"in 2015 alone, Freeport completed gold and copper valued at $3.1 billion."</seg>
<seg id="273">"in addition, Papua has wood resources valued at $78 billion."</seg>
<seg id="274">"these fortunes, however, are a source of misery for the Papua, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military has preserved a suffocating presence."</seg>
<seg id="275">"a study of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer."</seg>
<seg id="276">Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.</seg>
<seg id="277">"according to the activists, more than 500,000 Papua were killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military."</seg>
<seg id="278">Mass killings in Papuas tribal country in the 1970-s were considered to be genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.</seg>
<seg id="279">"in the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year."</seg>
<seg id="280">"we Making Everything" is said in a report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane from 2016, in which reports on atrocities of the previous year are included, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electrosurcharges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations. "</seg>
<seg id="281">"it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents occur," "says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia-researcher for Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="282">Bolts have intensified because Papuas resources produce a influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.</seg>
<seg id="283">"the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% of Christian, but demographic development changes because Muslim economic migrants are coming from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi."</seg>

<seg id="290">"but in Papua there is little change, and today the locals feel betrayed."</seg>
<seg id="291">"our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that it will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," "says You."</seg>
<seg id="292">"in fact, Paniai suffered a low point only two months after Jokowis's inauguration in October."</seg>
<seg id="293">"on 7 December 2014, a group of 11 kids was outdoors and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle through the darkness."</seg>
<seg id="294">The frightened children told them that they should turn off their spotlights.</seg>

<seg id="297">Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.</seg>
<seg id="298">"a child, the 16-year old Yulianus Yeimo, was so heavily beaten that he fell into coma."</seg>
<seg id="299">A few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set alight and the things escalated the next day.</seg>
<seg id="300">"about 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football ground in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice."</seg>
<seg id="301">They carried the ceremonial hunting ground and carried the Waita dance - continuously in the circle and mimicking a bird song - from Papuas Mee Pago tribe.</seg>
<seg id="302">Some protesters began to drag stones to police and military posts.</seg>
<seg id="303">"when the mood was heated, the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio:" if the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead, "it is said in an official TIME document that has not been released by local media."</seg>
<seg id="304">"Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home."</seg>
<seg id="305">Nobody was listening to the mood.</seg>
<seg id="306">"when I turned around, I suddenly shot into my left wrist," "he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house."</seg>
<seg id="307">"Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says that the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here."</seg>
<seg id="308">"it was overcrowded, many shots were fired," he adds. "</seg>
<seg id="309">"the native man Alfius Youw was hit three times, so his cousin, the witness of shooting."</seg>

<seg id="311">I saw that he was dead... I kissed him.</seg>
<seg id="312">"the chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to" secure "their station because they are attacked."</seg>
<seg id="313">"we must defend ourselves when people are threatening to kill us," "said the spokesman of the Papua police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015."</seg>
<seg id="314">"it is about life and death."</seg>
<seg id="315">"according to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more wounded."</seg>
<seg id="316">The news about the killings came only the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="317">"three weeks, Jokowi in Jayapura held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical grievances in Papua."</seg>
<seg id="318">"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="319">"in October 2016, Minister of Security, Wiranto, said that he set out an out-of-court mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations."</seg>
<seg id="320">But the excuses began almost immediately.</seg>
<seg id="321">"most injuries occurred a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="322">Some were in the 90's and the beginning of the 2000-s.</seg>
<seg id="323">"the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations, but there are processes that need to be traversed," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="324">Then Wiranto gave a retreat when he spoke to TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.</seg>
<seg id="325">"instead," everything is governed by law, "he said."</seg>
<seg id="326">"Wiranto, accused of" crimes against humanity, "which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody declaration of independence from 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been buried in Papua, including the Paniai incident."</seg>
<seg id="327">Families of the Paniai victims accepted such allegations with a grimming unbeliever.</seg>
<seg id="328">"I have been interviewed four times over the last three years, but there was no progress," says Yohanes. "</seg>
<seg id="329">"I am tired."</seg>
<seg id="330">He says he still lives in fear years later.</seg>
<seg id="331">"I'm afraid," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="332">"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot."</seg>
<seg id="333">His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people in Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.</seg>
<seg id="334">He says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims.</seg>
<seg id="335">"after I had buried the corpses, the military looked for me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="336">The shootings did not stop.</seg>
<seg id="337">"on Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniais neighborhood of Deiyai."</seg>

<seg id="340">Disturbed villagers protested in front of the company's office.</seg>
<seg id="341">The police said that villagers threw stones on officers who responded to them by firing warning shots.</seg>
<seg id="342">But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot the crowd and killed one.</seg>
<seg id="343">"we were so in panic, we are afraid that there will be vengeance," "says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were delivered quickly, so the TIME."</seg>
<seg id="344">"I hid myself two days in my house."</seg>
<seg id="345">The Deiyai Parliament has called upon to take account of the officers involved and withdraw the mobile brigade of the police from the territory.</seg>
<seg id="346">Paniai was always an immemorial of the Indonesian government.</seg>
<seg id="347">"the lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the tribal people Mee, Moni, Dani and damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua."</seg>
<seg id="348">"many joined the" Free Papua Movement "(OPM), the rebel army, claiming to defend the rights of Papua by spurting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="349">"some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudie Kogoya."</seg>
<seg id="350">"in response to this, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily arrested in custody, under the pretext of" safeguarding national sovereignty. ""</seg>
<seg id="351">Some never dive again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as" a tragic, forgotten village. ""</seg>
<seg id="353">Poverty alleviates discontent.</seg>
<seg id="354">"the little rice, which is sold in Encarotali, is too expensive for locals."</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is just as out of reach.</seg>
<seg id="356">People here build everything they eat: mainly Nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potato.</seg>
<seg id="358">They keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">"ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents)."</seg>
<seg id="360">"over time, economic inequalities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown, which have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport."</seg>
<seg id="361">The few jobs that exist in the region generally address the better educated and wealthier migrants.</seg>
<seg id="362">They rarely have capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own companies.</seg>
<seg id="363">"the young people are not interested in staying in the village... for there is no jobs or money," "says John Gobai, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Paniai."</seg>
<seg id="364">Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.</seg>
<seg id="365">"in addition, restrictions on the coverage of international media are tense."</seg>
<seg id="366">"at the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported to Papua because of lack of coordination with related institutions, although their rare permission to film was given to them."</seg>
<seg id="367">"according to Phelin Kine, the deputy head of Asia-Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis campaign to raise the restrictions on reporting in order to promote transparency and development is not realized."</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's most easternmost provinces of Papua and Western papua: visa denial and blacklist," he said in an explanation. "</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government largely remains confined to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March, six pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate" various and widespread injuries "in Papua including Paniai shooting."</seg>
<seg id="371">The same countries have historically supported the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="372">"the spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the accusations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta:" "in Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases."</seg>
<seg id="373">Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.</seg>
<seg id="374">"when an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the leadership of the human right Ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, natives journeyed and urged him" We want freedom, "according to a source which also participated in the session but would like to remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="375">Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 but the Papua states that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again.</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the paniai shots," says Gobai, Chairman of the Board of Directors. "</seg>
<seg id="377">"he wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military, is located in poor educational and health services."</seg>
<seg id="378">"Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their vote for Jokowi as a" "guilt" "that he must pay back."</seg>

<seg id="421">Electric-thousandsassa Elon Musk likes to deal with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."</seg>
<seg id="422">He has so far undermined that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding booking.</seg>
<seg id="423">"in addition to the constantly triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced for the first time another, less brilliant figure: the cancellations made at the new mass market model 3."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in recent months, Musk has frequently advertised more than 500,000 orders for the new car, whose delivery straight begins."</seg>
<seg id="425">"Musk admitted: from the 518,000 orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn."</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have always pointed out that only non-binding reservations are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="427">"during a cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds)" "reservation payment". ""</seg>
<seg id="428">"at the moment, 455.000 of such non-binding reservations are taking place in a telephone conference with analysts."</seg>
<seg id="429">"however, Tesla chief does not believe that the cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders could become a problem."</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">"last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles."</seg>
<seg id="432">"2018 - all models are to be combined - 500,000 be one million by 2020."</seg>

<seg id="435">"who orders a" Model 3 "today, may anticipate delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla manages to drive its brand-new, unprecedented production roads without major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization."</seg>

<seg id="440">"one day after he was sued from 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the environmental protection authority, resorted his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce the emissions of smog-causing air pollutants."</seg>

<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeals.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is about a deadline that ran for states on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for Ozone.</seg>
<seg id="444">"Pruten announced in June that he will delay compliance with a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid" interfere in local decisions, or to interfere with economic growth. "</seg>
<seg id="445">"Pruitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump Attorney of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of tougher environmental protection regulations for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="446">"since its arrival in Washington, Pruten has repeatedly been repealed to block or delay regulations that resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels."</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Prudent's regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">"last month, a Washington Federal Court ruled that the EPA Administrator has exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methanlecks."</seg>
<seg id="449">"in a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that its reversal of ozone standards simply increased the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards."</seg>
<seg id="450">"under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then been accused of being accused of activist groups and others, and agreed in an agreement to determine the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who defends the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.

<seg id="466">"750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the parish church, the old cemetery areal in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 pm was invited to a Serenade."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters of the tumor to their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village small treasure."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergische yearbook:" "Graf Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Abbey" "to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver."</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the proclamation of the certificate, on the hill, besides the former parish church, there was also a marvellous court, to which the church or patron is owned and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, alongside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible in the village image of turrets, the" mountain "of the third, the magnificent settlement centre of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 are underlining the historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage was originated from the early medieval self-church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church and occupied with a pastor, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">"associated with this, the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop."</seg>
<seg id="479">Three altars existed in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The bigger of the two crumbled at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but later had to be released in the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were hammered and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops were encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">"they took out the pulpit and the church-chairs, and used them as firewood."</seg>
<seg id="486">Remnants of the church threatened to crash in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tumor Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead in Hörschweiler."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's night in 1834 a storm splitted the steeple and half plunged.</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">"only the tower, which is still existing today, remained a witness to the 750-year-old church history."</seg>
<seg id="493">"today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem care about the" "creative retirees" "as successor of Dieter Dockhorn."</seg>
<seg id="494">"as a promoter, the friends and promoters invite tumours on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade from the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with essays by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">"Hartmut Romann, speaks the closing word."</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission starts at 3: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="499">"to the end of the Serenade, there is a trunk in front of the cemetery."</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest," the organizers take the fantastic view. "</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">"the organisers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius complex, which is of significance for tumors and radio-schweiler."</seg>

<seg id="504">Association wants to permit the approval of wind turbines</seg>
<seg id="505">"Boisheim defends itself" does not see a legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the country council.</seg>
<seg id="506">"the association" Boisheim, "has called on Board of Directors Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette."</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, as at the time in Viersen there was only a wind force concentration zone at the border to Schwalmtal."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy utilization for the remaining city area."</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are meant to prevent "sparing" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">"the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days earlier, but the district government of Dusseldorf had not approved it because of a lack of form."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning legal requirements, the approval of approval is still unlawful and therefore to take back," said Christoph Erkens, who is the president of Boisheim. "</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of affairs: before the summer break the municipal council again resolved the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; approval of the district government is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="514">"Erkens:" "at this point, the issuance of a permit for the establishment of wind energy systems is not legally ruled out."</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation.</seg>
<seg id="516">"the corresponding letter has been received by Viersen since last week," "declared a spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes them to test the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">"however, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped."</seg>
<seg id="519">"with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself to the argumentation of the association" Boisheim. ""</seg>
<seg id="520">"the NEW, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning to build four each 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area of the Boisheimer Nette."</seg>
<seg id="521">"last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, had closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the construction of the four wind turbines, the power requirement of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer there was a green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich Windpark near Aachen as well as an investment in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg District.</seg>

<seg id="532">Bad Langensalza and people from the region are to discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.</seg>
<seg id="533">The commercial association and the city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on September 8th and 9th in order to lure the inhabitants to the city centre for shopping.</seg>
<seg id="534">"as the Chairman of the Gewerbeverein, Christian König, announced, the" home-shopping "weekend should sensitize customers what offers their own city apart from the usual supermarket-goods."</seg>
<seg id="535">"according to plan, a market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market, is planned."</seg>

<seg id="544">"in addition, customer potentials should be reopened or reopened."</seg>
<seg id="545">These include spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But many locals would also have lost the city center while shopping from the view.</seg>
<seg id="547">"at the end, everyone would have to help revive the city centre - to landlords, the factories of the whole city and clubs."</seg>
<seg id="548">"it was time to overcome the lethargy with a network, which partly grew up, had said King in the spring."</seg>
<seg id="549">"Birgit Streich, director of the Chamber of Commerce in Mühlhausen, informed that the third" home shopping "day, for the first time, took part in five Thuringian cities."</seg>
<seg id="550">"in addition to Bad Langensalza, this is Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode."</seg>
<seg id="551">"the day should" "promote appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common good of our cities", "says Streich."</seg>

<seg id="592">"although the suspects remain unrestricted for decades, citizens say that double motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex."</seg>

<seg id="742">Pruitt had announced the intention of EPA in June to determine the ozone provisions - in which in some parts of the country pollutant emissions must be measured in order to comply with stricter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018.</seg>
<seg id="743">"a group of 15 most democratic states, together with the district of Colombia, filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal."</seg>

<seg id="864">In the Ore Mountains the three chain is to be further optimized.</seg>
<seg id="865">And a gate after a collision doesn't want to capture the Fortunas any more.</seg>
<seg id="866">"for the future, there will be no more than Michael (Rensing)."</seg>
<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that his team will better cope with the experience in preparation with the three chain than with the four-legged chain.</seg>
<seg id="868">"still I don't know how to act in Aue," "said his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause," "because we are in the three chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build up well," "said Hoffmann."</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we can even better harmonize and we do not make so many flaws in the construction."</seg>
<seg id="870">"of course, also Hoffmann travels to Aue to win the game."</seg>
<seg id="871">"but whether you can talk about a misguided start, don't know."</seg>
<seg id="872">"the performance could indeed be okay," "said Hoffmann."</seg>
<seg id="873">"but if we stand with four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a regular season opener."</seg>

<seg id="875">"I judge the start into the season only after six to eight playing days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who did not want to talk of an advantage over Aue, just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be cancelled due to a storm. "</seg>
<seg id="876">"now they can start the season practically with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann might even be able to be a bit fresher since they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a ascension favourite in the bones. "</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they don't know so 100% where they are currently," "says the inner defender of Fortuna."</seg>
<seg id="878">"admittedly, the guests from the Rhineland as a light favorite on Sunday go to the meeting at last (almost) finished stadium of Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we sweep them away, only because we have the right to come under the first six is rubbish," says Funkel, whose balance is absolutely positive with only a defeat against Aue out of nine games. "</seg>

<seg id="884">"the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, who have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years. but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results."</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish Food Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started performing the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">"during the asylum procedure, they should make a more precise assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) has been criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees."</seg>
<seg id="887">"until today, Migrationsverket has sent 6.880 cases to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid March to 31 July 2017."</seg>
<seg id="888">"eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, whereas in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was" possibly 18 years or older. ""</seg>
<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old."</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Göransson, from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been steady in recent months."</seg>
<seg id="892">"we don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are fairly constant," "he said, The Local."</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">"in May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases to suggest that the investigated person was 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">"when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 results, she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had frankly said that she was 18 years old this year."</seg>
<seg id="896">"the method of medical age assessment involving X-ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI shots of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, was also criticized in some areas."</seg>
<seg id="897">A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute whose work encompasses the evaluation of the biological maturity of people to see if they were used earlier or later than usually by puberty.</seg>
<seg id="898">I had reason to think about it and I don't think the kind of measurement should be used.</seg>
<seg id="899">Judging biological age in this way is very unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="900">"if we can't say it certainly, we shouldn't pretend as if we could," he said to the newspaper Metro. "</seg>
<seg id="901">"however, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defends the accuracy of the tests:" in general, you can say that the risk of being incorrectly judged as an adult is low. "</seg>

<seg id="1122">"the rules aimed at preventing unobstructed issues of European soccer clubs will not bother Neymar's world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the leading organisation that supervises the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious champions league tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules established in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG must point out that the transfer from Neymar was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million $) to get the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"PSG can safely make the money loose so that Neymar underwrites and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy-rich family of Qatar from Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs may apply a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but have to object with legitimate income sources, which enable them to turn the break-even point in their business related to football."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that Vereine, who had made enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively deceived and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debts of clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea, bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"and although Platini has fallen in favour of the presidency in 2015, Aleksander Ceferin will continue to be intimidated by excessive expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future," "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the Buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for invoicing on the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"for the next five years, Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the sum total of EUR 44.4 million will be expelled in the financial statements for the next five years."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 took the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG received a fine 60 million Euro (then USD 82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League were limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise ordinary 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overhaul their financial supervision by raising their income by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a catargic company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring was to exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not render this as legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the sponsorship of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar via payments by the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 denied that Neymar's World Cup ambassador will become and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulatory authorities is easy to figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "the sanctions against PSG meant that the UEFA will be more attentive to observe any attempt to bypass the rules."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"UEFA had no preliminary discussions with PSG about Neymars Transfer, on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>

<seg id="1158">Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier</seg>
<seg id="1159">"in recent years, Chocolat has made friy board chocolate for Swiss."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"now, the sweet co-operation is at a possible end: the airline will reprint the order."</seg>
<seg id="1161">"on request of the news agency, Swiss-spokesperson Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report of the newspaper" "Northwestern Switzerland" "from Friday."</seg>
<seg id="1162">"according to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.</seg>
<seg id="1164">"we are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokesperson. "</seg>
<seg id="1165">"around 17 million small red-white, packed charts of 14 grams will distribute the flight attendants to the passengers prior to landing."</seg>
<seg id="1166">Swiss Life did not want to give any information about the cost.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"industry insiders value the order volume according to" "Northwestern Switzerland" "between 1.5 and 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately 1 billion Swiss francs."</seg>
<seg id="1168">But more important is the advertising effect: for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious order.</seg>
<seg id="1169">The Swiss does not want to betray how many applicants have received it at the new tender.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But only Swiss manufacturers are coming into question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">"according to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renew the contract over the spring of 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1172">"for the sda, the biggest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for an opinion."</seg>
<seg id="1173">The Swiss chocolate tables have been distributing their flights on board of their flights since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="1174">"before the Swiss concluded a contract with Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug."</seg>
<seg id="1175">The opportunity to place the logo brought Swiss over two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolat Frey.</seg>

<seg id="1184">"this repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80-s, for the 90-year Grunge era (as the pioneers David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch comedy" The State "for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things."</seg>
<seg id="1185">"as a cultural artefact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories."</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels as if the time is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" was surprisingly good, not just because of his absurd humour (it contained a original story for a talking box of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin). "</seg>
<seg id="1188">"by getting to the core of the gags - middle aged actors play awesome children, who will grow - nevertheless, they managed to win the last part of the heat."</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults playing adults now is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more to the foundational principle, including a riff for the Stalker films of the 90-s as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle"). "</seg>
<seg id="1190">"at one point a character emerges from an Apple PowerBook, some inline skates and a number of other things from the year 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">"the sweet Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau)."</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"and there's another crazy malignant plot, included in Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black)."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"as always, the exams are the best part of the franchise."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"it is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt ll's lower lip-bart by" Singles, "whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy is now feeling like an old boy."</seg>
<seg id="1197">"it's the moments of accidental insanity that could provoke this franchise as a kind of repetitive" "Seven Up!" "series until it reaches what I call his logical conclusion:" wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later, "whose last scene will show the world premiere of" Wet Hot American Summer. ""</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now remembers a different kind of nostalgia: to the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East versus West Ring Contexation iconography. "</seg>
<seg id="1199">"the comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism."</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-tuned Gregory and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues of Channing Tatum (also an extensive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English are synced.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is an ingenious idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV how Americans might do it with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">"and the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick offers, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - ensures a decent match 'Find the voice out'."</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda-drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often happens like a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">"there are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or frequent."</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective, who has been rearranged to a smaller length, could better deliver his agitprop satire because Gregor and Iosef continue to visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers."</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything to feed for a vague.</seg>

<seg id="1210">Blow against drugs mafia in the country</seg>
<seg id="1211">The police have succeeded in making a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">"on Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar district, in Rottweil, Constance, Esslingen and Stuttgart."</seg>
<seg id="1213">Fifteen accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and had already issued an arrest warrant against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">"in addition, the officials charged greater quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euro."</seg>
<seg id="1215">"at the same time, two persons were arrested in Italy."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"against the two suspects Italians, there were German Arrest Warrant orders."</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two are probably delivered to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1219">More than 300 police officers were in use.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"the Mafia members are accused of organised drug crime, heavy violence, desperate murder, robbery and extortion."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"since summer 2016, the public prosecutor's office of Konstanz started to investigate the organised drug trade in southern Germany."</seg>
<seg id="1222">"between the public prosecutor's office in Konstanz and Palermo, there was a lively exchange and investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily."</seg>
<seg id="1223">"therefore, on Wednesday morrow, the large-scale deployment was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo."</seg>

<seg id="1227">"data from citizens who should not show up" "according to a report, the foreigners register in Germany has significant shortcomings."</seg>
<seg id="1228">This leads to some serious misdecisions in case of asylum procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1229">"according to a media report, the Commissioner for the Refugee Management of the Federal Government, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to large gaps in the Foreigner Central Registry."</seg>
<seg id="1230">"deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to some serious misdecisions in case of asylum procedures and deportations, in a manner in which the" Süddeutsche Zeitung "has been analysed."</seg>
<seg id="1231">"according to the data, ten million people with foreign citizenship are recorded in the register, among them about 5.7 million from non-EU countries."</seg>
<seg id="1232">The data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1233">"since the data has not been adequately maintained, the data quality has not been good in parts so far."</seg>
<seg id="1234">"in individual cases, data from 1921 was found," "of people who are no longer alive, or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register."</seg>
<seg id="1235">"faulty data inputs can slow down reversal processes," says the report. "</seg>
<seg id="1236">"moreover, in the statistics of people who travel abroad, there are also EU citizens who wouldn't have to travel abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1237">"but such misconceptions led" "to a distorted debate on dealing with a paid-out", "that is, in the analysis."</seg>
<seg id="1238">"meanwhile, the German government has apparently started sending refugee families to Italy with less than 16 year old children if they have entered from there."</seg>
<seg id="1239">"this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the" New Osnabrück Newspaper. ""</seg>
<seg id="1240">"therefore, the paper states that BAMF is conducting such proceedings" concerning families with children, with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017. "</seg>
<seg id="1241">"since the end of 2014, this was practically no longer possible, so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on the ground."</seg>
<seg id="1242">"according to the Dublin Convention, the EU state is responsible for refugees, which they first reach."</seg>
<seg id="1243">"if a migrant is travelling to another EU country, this state can return it to the entry-line."</seg>
<seg id="1244">"for the reason, the ministry is now writing:" in the meantime, the capacity for families with underage children in Italy has considerably increased. "</seg>

<seg id="1255">"a single blood donation helps several people," explained the Regional Director of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, for the preserved foods are broken into their constituent parts. "</seg>
<seg id="1256">"in this way, three people could benefit from a blood donation."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"at the same time, Maisenbacher reported about the actions carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"this year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK district leader. "</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is likely to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it kept the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensifying pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the monetary policy makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, whereby less members expected a rise in this month because the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflationary report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, and warned that the pressure on household income would rise, while inflation is expected to rise to almost 3% in the fall."</seg>
<seg id="1267">But they signalized that interest rates would be necessary in the coming years to hug the inflation heated by the Brexit and they said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">Members also agreed to withdraw part of the mammoth business package which was issued a year ago after the Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the coming February, although it has been said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said:" in the central prognosis of the MPC the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as the pressure on the real income of households continued to limit consumption. "</seg>
<seg id="1271">"at the interest rates, it reaffirmed that" "a certain streamlining of monetary policy" "for the cooling of inflation and a" "somewhat larger" "scale would be required than the markets expect."</seg>
<seg id="1272">Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the Bank stressed that increases were" gradual "and" limited. ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has retained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound fell to the dollar and the euro after these news.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">The decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations of a interest rate and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2% increased to 0.3% in the previous three months.</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth is expected to lie at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will easily recover after the bank at the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor enhancements, as the tightening is first even worse before it becomes better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot" "prevent" "income from income, but she added that wages at the end of her three-year forecast can" "clearly" "recover."</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which is compensated for a portion of lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">"the decision comes a year after the interest rates fall to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote, which caused the tines of the ground."</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the Bank's last decision on interest rates, the call has increased after a rate of interest, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed homes, with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation last month fell from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank said that this was expected and will continue to attract them over the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">"the Bank said that the exceeding in proportion to its target of 2% was" "completely" "attributable to the weak pound."</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said:" in view of the recent decline in the Swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive as the creditors are looking for shops and want to finish the year in a positive way. "</seg>
<seg id="1289">"the market is very good for those with which the current deals are running and the new mortgages are closed, and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe 10,000 people controversial HIV-Drug"</seg>
<seg id="1291">"as of September, patients will receive access to a" transformative "HIV prevention treatment after a fight in the NHS for funding the drug in the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that a prepress prophylaxis (prep) before the intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high risk patients by around 86 percent, is now supplied by the health service via a first three-yearly study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeals confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year, according to which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chef Simon Stevens as" "important new intervention", "while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to sign up, and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Prepress prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations taken prior to sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection hazards.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before intercourse means that just enough medication is present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications may be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"in clinics, appropriate participants are identified to agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV-status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral therapy."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a GP can also opt-in to participate in their local attending sexual clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will receive £10 million and NHS UK signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to evaluate the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence, as it is targeted and implemented in a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should complement and overhaul the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in coping with one of humanity's greatest health challenges. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust) said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, if targeted and vulnerable people are targeted, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, which leads to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must now be that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now that the prep test medicine was obtained, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said:" "the beginning of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and reluctant implementation by the government."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that it will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court home into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, fell in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not grabbed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," "says Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with her and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot large apartment has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted Joanne closet space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the Architectural and Designstudio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms overlap, so that the architectural challenge consisted in creating a mezzanine where you could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steelwork is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other, without nesting ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled it to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"using mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we offer mirrored units for all the funnels and glasses of joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering started in," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is counterweighty, so that when you push the door, it is very easy to glide."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day, you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," "says Erfan."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high-quality materials, which give the space its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and help them to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't dearest into the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and higher square metric tons of something standardly into something amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"in fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them."</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>

<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from the family business since 2014 but a sharp analysis of the separation takes place at the Supreme Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the Brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"based in Waiblingen near Stuttgart, Germany, and employing 6,100 associates, the Bosch Packaging Technology division is one of the leading suppliers of process and packaging technology."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"following an agreement with her late father, Colin was described by Paul as" the main operator and the dominant personality "in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of company assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">"a court file states that this means that colin property has a value of $316 million, and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of property and cash has proved to be a point of appeal for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the assessments suggested by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business, of which Colin, as Paul claims, have excluded him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul to manage some possessions incompetently."</seg>

<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who had run milk-bars and delicatessens from the late 1950-s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeansload of the family.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Umps of new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reported that the White House's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a smoother course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, gathered at his first day of work with leading employees, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House that he wants to repair: poor information that comes into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring its media diet."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps ties to television last decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was annoyed because of unfair reporting it was productive to show him that he got a fair reporting of places that were to convince," "said the former election campaign manager Sam Nunberg in February towards Politico."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara palmeri wrote at the time that" "the key to keeping Trumps Twitter custom was under control, according to six ex-election officials there to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Alright.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter custom ever was under control is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know others - that trumps didn't contain any more fuel without their intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We probably never know about the tweets that Trump didn't send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his associates hired him a few times, to keep anger from him, their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has ever been able to prevent it from provoking trump-controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that the people in a White House, who are composed of competing parties, always attempt to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that possibly promotes their views of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to give the President doubtful information to the President for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump is able to react to negative press cuts like a volcano, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he tries to find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"that happened at the end of February when someone suspected the President malicious a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the web site of Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy commander Katie Walsh to be" the source behind a pile of leaks "at the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter, or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false reproaches in the past and has revoked it."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began asking employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, attempted to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tried three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self and his advisers are still looking for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1430">"they brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were kicked out in May without being deterred by a ditch digging from the Council to prevent their incursions."</seg>
<seg id="1431">The tactful group found a gap in the defensive structures and squeezed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.</seg>
<seg id="1432">"angry inhabitants have pushed the Council of Solihull, who said it was" useless to deal with the problem. "</seg>
<seg id="1433">"an anonymous inhabitant said," They went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passers-by. "</seg>
<seg id="1434">"the Council must be forced into action by shame to implement, as it was useless in dealing with the problem."</seg>

<seg id="1444">"from Birkenhof, then Waldhotel Luise"</seg>
<seg id="1445">"from the former hotel Birkenhof, the Waldhotel Luise is located."</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"due to the closure of the hotel Birkenhof through the Ambiente Operating Company Ltd until 13 April 2014, some 30,000 overnights per year were lost and income from the tourist tax was also lost."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the autumn of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the district, the hotel building offered the council office as a group accommodation, which provided controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed in the Council at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1452">"but above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious potential customers at the house back then."</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">"the group of Luisenhausen with businesswoman Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and will again make it a house of the Three Star Plus Category under the name Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"you will find Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"at the former hotel Birkenhof, there have been construction shuttings in front of the entrance for some time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations will be made."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors were torn out, ceilings are partly demolished, old bathtubs are removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still a lot to do in March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built into."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should later become" "beautiful" "as Thomas Scherer expresses."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery,"</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotel in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale downtown level, underlined shearers."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the forest hotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide, says Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"either single vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel at ease in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already conducted talks with OB-Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, so Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The ideas of the city were identical with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"after the amount of investment required, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to specify precisely."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"less than a million euros, he reckons."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"also the outdoor plants are brought forward to the front-man, this is already clearly visible."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"in a courtyard there is a large terrace, which will be accessible from the restaurant that is public."</seg>
<seg id="1478">Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Russia-monkey: us special organiser sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russian affair with US President Donald Trump, special investigators Robert Mueller should have used a so-called Grand Jury for a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the committee took up work in recent weeks, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "calling on familiar people."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper reported the step as a sign that Mueller extended and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the station CNN reported, there were already first charges of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between the old son and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services accuse the Kremlin to engage in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trumps election team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigations, several men are to stand, who acted as advisor to the Republican in the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"reportedly, Mueller also took more and more trumps of private and business environment under the microscope."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"a few weeks ago, the" Washington Post "wrote that the special issuer Trump came to the center personally and investigate whether the President could possibly hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">"the main task of Grand Jurys is to prove this evidence in possible crime cases, and to decide whether it should be charged."</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called to count.</seg>
<seg id="1491">"in most cases, they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be switched on by the public prosecutor's office in order to charge people for interrogation under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the station CNN, lectures have already been issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"people who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement, said it in the report."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. there were also Trumps consultant and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former election campaign manager Paul Manafort.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the suspension would show that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work, and that he should act quickly if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the institution of the Gremium is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concern for president Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President, on Thursday evening, used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russian affair as a campaign for its political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russian history is a total invention," said Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the topic gives the democrats an opportunity to feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">"his special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a statement, he knew nothing about setting up a Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1505">"however, these work usually in secret, he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House rejects any action that accelerates the work of the special switch to "fair" mode.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI boss James Comey said three times that not against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"there is no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the Declaration."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this root-throw accusations against Trump have been loud, he refused to impede the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June before a Senate Committee, Trump asked him for an investigation of the investigation against the national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"after the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special worker and his associates."</seg>
<seg id="1514">The speculative speculation is whether Trump Mueller would release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair surrounding the later President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he theoretically could be fired by the president of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented legislative drafts on Thursday, after which the special mediator could no longer be released so easily."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant ice-mountain drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the western Antarctic a gigantic iceberg has loosened from the scarcely seven-fold size of Berlin from the Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was granted by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the colossus across a Billion ton, heavy and 5800 square kilometers, is now driving north and probably need two, three years until it melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 km, it is one of the largest ice-giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger to man from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"to what extent climate change has played a role in breaking the iceberg, is unclear after research data."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, there have been a series of unusual interruptions of ice hoops in the region for about 30 years, writes the U.S. Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this can be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now depleted colossus was so far a part of the Larsen C Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">It floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It grows further into the sea and breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen C Schelbat lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this schooling the balance of waxing and vomiting was disturbed a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete Schelfeits be smashed there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot of evidence that Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, as the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice plate stands under tension and can fall apart if at a key point a piece abrupts."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of Schelfeits and Eisberg does not increase sea level because they float on the water and ice so much water as it produces after melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the Schelfeise causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase sea level, but only in a small extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI-information, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest jackal of Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the crossing from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural event and we have no direct connection to climate change, the ice sign is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most broadest retreat since the beginning of the record," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists have argued whether the Larsen C Schelfeis will now grow back or go back in the long term, and possibly collectively, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers did not lead the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, the Antarctic peninsula flourished in recent decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic extends in the direction of South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decline in temperature increased.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has been warming up around three degrees over the last 50 years and thus count towards the areas where the temperature is the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1559">"among other things, doctors and engineers, as well as forces of general administration, are sought."</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"according to the parties' desire, the administration is to work out a concept for recruiting personnel and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is to meet not only short-term demands on specialists, but to counteract the future-oriented job shortage, it is said."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should orientate itself internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-entrants and include an education offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems you did not know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is of a real competition by the public employer.</seg>
<seg id="1568">"in addition, a high number of employees, due to illness or age-related reasons, comes from the service."</seg>
<seg id="1569">"the highest time for action, therefore, cannot remain unoccupied."</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint motion with his party."</seg>

<seg id="1573">"if we do not come here at short notice to a satisfying solution, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - should strive for a house-tariff," "said peoples."</seg>
<seg id="1574">"thus, the CDU tries to pay better the employees and officials than it actually previews the tariff of the public service."</seg>
<seg id="1575">"salaries are currently precisely prescribed, increases or more money is only available when switching to a higher level that is oriented to professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">"however, the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years."</seg>

<seg id="1581">"when NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue," "said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa."</seg>
<seg id="1582">"Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat of the German Relief Organisation" Youth Rettet, "because their team worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration."</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to express detailed allegations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," the organization said in a statement on social media. "</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can only evaluate all allegations that are currently being raised, after we have collected all the information and assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is suspected that his crew receives inflatable migrants on board, which can be delivered directly from traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting was supposedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the acts of the Prosecutor, whose contents were published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected of being overthrown by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the area of humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the Code of Conduct, boats like the Iuventa have to have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any" essential changes or disabilities "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">"among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize winner organisation doctors Without Borders (MSF)."</seg>
<seg id="1594">"in the meantime, Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations occurred in recent weeks, indicating that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local civil servants have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister. "</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the staff of the weekly Riodoce normally meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists are discussing what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leaving them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, Neutrals, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feelings reach."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no break from violence, and while the bodies accumulate throughout the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took up his office in December 2012. 589 are at least seven dead in seven countries this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence is felt deep, although his presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word" Justice. "two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or its typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Special State Attorney General was established in 2010, in order to process the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the thousands of murders connected with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are unerratic and even though the terrain is still traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of safety has little benefits, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the Why, we distrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">He was forced to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "12th river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter went away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But Valdez is nothing more than silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions are fighting to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the road or that the graveyard is full of decorated, two-story Mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" when only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, in February the publication of an interview with Damascene Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this release may have annoyed the sons, presumed vein members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to force Valdez to leave Valdez, after confiscating another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He served as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues for the establishment of Riodosio and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the dowry problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, revenues and advertising."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters dared to be able to publish harsh investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to deal with."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize "for her coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history wherever they were."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue to live," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you have to take over the task, which falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb."</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," "What did you do in the face of so many dead? why did you not tell what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun-bird, who was able to curse like a harbor worker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite from the office, and always sit there on the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their job best, and to stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you engage with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home start- and runways" to move drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened to Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - as not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room in which the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ripolce in a four-storey building in a mid-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who signed the Governor himself as untrustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Ripolce rested on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was assassination of the brother of the former famous speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé about the state spending that was concentrated on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"there was a group that was abducted in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI) that ruled almost the whole century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, the readers would have seen the column of Valdez as the best informed source of the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"before we had known what happened," "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "El Flaco" "because of his slender body stature."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez has become a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning for a further journalist on the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burned-in body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is its."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing" SOS Press "protests and constructions in organized protests."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they have said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then, she has asked that she is re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organized crime including government officials and a similar society.</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces that were hiding under a blanket with organised crime."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media group" Articulo 19 "assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to hold the mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern limit state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"her body was found along with a note, which was supposed to be signed by the Zetas Kartell:" here I am because of my reports. "</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones were standing next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border-state Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue on how El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a editorial on the title page titled" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is hard to find work in exile and they still watch the streets and look for danger.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who stay behind and continue work, it is a daily dance with risky choices."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, states that the drug trade is scaring him."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico is going to hell, and so I became a reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer, as at once all their phones began to summon."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shooting with Bandenrivalen and security forces near the seaside resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war escalated further as it was promised by a series of cartel embassies in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">From the Bordino edge they have published the news on the website of Riodoce via mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens resting near - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who kept their guard to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all Sinaloa, the staff of Ripolce followed his tracks."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you just think about it," "said Bojorquez," "if on the same day, when Javier was murdered, the trainee asked me to send them to the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used cloak to avoid his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first sight it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"now researchers have found out that the first findings of the unbelievable rhinoceros of a Canadian miners have been preserved so well that experts described it as" "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs". ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so well received that they could even discover that his flaky skin was of reddish brown - and they said they had something of an" "troubled past." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described him as" the persistent vegetative dinosaur, who has ever been found, and one of the world's best dinosaurs specimens. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">Fossil is a newly discovered type of natura that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his incredibly well-preserved condition has astonished researchers, who describe it as" truly remarkable. ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic the armoured plant-eater is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk as he grub on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth lumps."</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blink a little with your eyes, you might almost believe it has slept," "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs specimens, the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers found out that these herbivores, even though it is covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by meat eaters dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counter-burial, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed to get better in his surroundings and to dodge his enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines for the first time in May and is now visible at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and named Borealopelta Markabchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours, carefully covering it."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shade, a widespread defense-method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the conteration is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the living animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur of enough pressure was hunted by meat eating dinosaurs that the evolution favoured the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the counter-shade - think of roe deer, zebras or belt-animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than booty, indicating that this Nodosha was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur carnivores must have been the Cretaceous period," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal on pointers about his life, including his conserved intestinal perusal to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur when he died, got into a river and pushed out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the seabed."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as Souflorida today, and rivers and oceans probably farther farther inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preservative schuppiger skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal today looks the same as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you only play a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that he is in sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous period was a time when huge thermal geodes, carnivorous dinosaurs, which stood on two legs, crossed the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was chased by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in the mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk as he buried in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the dusty armoured dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from muzzle to hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures had an average of around 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"it contained two 20-inch long spikes, which hung from his shoulders."</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armoured plant-eater was swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaur kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are preserved so well that the bonfires cover still bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a lottery prize."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">"petrified remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates, which carry the skull of the animal."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot lies at his side, his five fingers are spread upwards."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on its sole.</seg>
<seg id="1971">In thunderstorm: Massenkarambolage on A8: many injured</seg>
<seg id="1972">Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: almost 30 cars are wrapped in a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">"there are numerous wounded, kilometre-long Staus and Gaffer."</seg>
<seg id="1974">"on the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), about 20 people were injured in a mass arambolage on Thursday afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"after the first indications of the police were about 5 p.m. between the junction stations Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm almost 30 cars, among them probably also trucks."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"at first, there are no indications of the exact number of injured parties."</seg>
<seg id="1977">"it is a light to medium-heavy injury, said a police spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large amount of bailout vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of Munich an approximately ten kilometres long back stau formed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">"as a AZ-reporter reports, it also came on the counter track to massive disabilities - through numerous Gaffer."</seg>
<seg id="1982">"the fire brigade was the mark of the vehicle anchors, who now have to reckon with sensitive punishments."</seg>
<seg id="1983">"shortly after 18: 45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing."</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing reminding you in the train and sleeping.</seg>

<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are soon over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the paperless ticket inspections.</seg>

<seg id="1998">"" "comfort Check-in" "calls the train devaluation without a conductor."</seg>
<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use this, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to have an online ticket - which already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"it also has to be purchased via the subway, DB navigator, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking."</seg>
<seg id="2002">"finally, you need a seat reservation."</seg>
<seg id="2003">"because the" comfort check-in "works like that: you get into the train, call his ticket under" My Tickets. ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">"for the test customers, a button for electronic devaluation will appear."</seg>

<seg id="2006">"comes the train companion at ticket inspections to place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with an already validated online ticket."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"so you can still sleep, keep on working, keep silent."</seg>
<seg id="2008">"check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn uses the passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you want to travel relaxed without ticketing through our train companion staff, in the DB Navigator, simply check yourself."</seg>

<seg id="2013">"for many times, however, in any case one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents required for the devaluation of online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"either the credit card or identity card is missing, or else a document you have to assign."</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between rider and passenger, leading to bad mood in the compartment or greater space and delays in controlling their own ticket, and taking the time to take care of other concerns."</seg>

<seg id="2024">"confused, as nobody else posted the information on her feed, she closed on Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was to tweet the death of Michael Brown, a unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns lifeless body hanging on the street and staying there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," "thought Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her cell phone to tweet later in the evening to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people crying out, and from a man who claimed to be Brown's father who was wearing a sign with the inscription:" Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed where a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman detained his rifle and cried," I am going to kill you... animals all. ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," "Ferrell remembered her statement."</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder we have accustomed to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shivering frost.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets?, "in cinemas after 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance which consists of the people's point of view and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as ferrell with her daughter, who carried a flower dress and a matching crown to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">We are going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I couldn't take her away," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What is happening today is a high point of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be raised therein.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to liberate ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience anti-latent racism, she is not different from the next black female child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would have a bad service to keep them away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp territory when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed totally after August 9," she said, and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis as president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Everything has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-FARRAR only wanted to" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to the point:" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community profiting from their pain and their resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan already collaborated with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt inmates."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought the project nearer to Ferrell, along with six other natives, the team of" Whose Streets "followed suit in the years after Browns."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we talk," Davis said. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, because so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the aim was not to focus on Ferris's experience - to show that it is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "are surprising personal aspects of Ferrara's life as she falls in love and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that in this work and in the humanization of black people there must be a certain vulnerability.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferris's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who have shaped the film" Blacklist Matter "in social media after the killing of the black teenager's Trayde Martin in 2012, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in executive positions have carried the movement overall," "said Ferrell," "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the main load of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to note that" "the movement is truly held by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of its identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shakes this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence even though it was in front of the front because with a life at these junctions as a black, gay woman is so much in the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel her energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long gone, but the racial ties between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on proof for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Yet she is clinging to a chant and she feels committed to this memory since she walked into Ferguson three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love and support one another.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">"but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone, since the first presentation 2009, splits the population into advocates and opponents."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the subject hardly leaves one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit gallery say," That would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be really great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" don't need a human "(Siggi Betzen) or simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"during the proponents that a gallery draws more customers into the city, from which the rest of the shops benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the farmer market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"at the beginning of the construction work, it will end."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the gallery owners want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda place, with possibility to sit outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been shopping almost weekly for many years in the Farmers Market Hall.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the farm women are happy again and again."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like that even during and especially after the building of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"in other cities, there is that too."</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this should not be very low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Rezension: Hilary Mantel: "bring Up the Bodies"</seg>
<seg id="2107">"clothes, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough of this in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shops in a shopping mall are only rented by larger companies, because the rent there are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"what a pity, specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the peasant market hall go down during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the Ges.st Bit-Gallery already manage to distribute all business from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that is simply not going to work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real peasant market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But there is no place for a peasant market hall thanks to the incredibly many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg no more.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmer's market is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York a lot of faces can be seen - white, black and brown, almost imperceptible, hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by Heather Dewey-Hagnau by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg who were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analyst banned a 35-year prison sentence after she was classified as secret diplomatic reports about WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline involved her expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transwife and dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagtide has been created by algorithmic analysis of the DNA that was extracted by Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, the many ways that can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a granny, black-white selfie where Manning clearly sits on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blond wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagnau joined the big success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette butt and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time they received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"she could not be photographed at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal bridles which over the course of two years exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a comic" Suppressed Images, "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president chats chelated judgment and would be able to personally see the exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published to demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome type of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong, as Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender soldiers to find new, tweetable ways to flames the rigid divisions that he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen for a particular reason. ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning with its oversized signature (the" i "in her family name is equipped with a heart) an end to the" automatic dispersion, "whose basis gender, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped, by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific encyclopaedia of the artist), how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring about it is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, late Memories, is also visible. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA dates can tell so many different stories, so the thirty of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition that is stored in a separate room is a page from the above Comic-Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows that Manning shows how she pops up with a free spree in his hand from the disciplinarian barracks of the United States as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they make your speech known, then they have won," "said it."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goose bumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - as it was supposed to be anticipated in the comic book - but if she was supposed to do it, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacists, who assemble themselves like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also targeted as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning stature), in which their genetic haplogins were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had her on the wall, but I wanted her to feel like a crowd," "said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits."</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was shaping up with Chelsea, like the movement that also stuck behind her liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2159">"a country-wide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee, looking for a suspect after a man was stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries."</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) issued an arrest warrant against murder on the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as evidenced by Cook County's acts."</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the corpse was discovered on July 27th.</seg>

<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A speaker from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and ready to help the US investigative authorities in any way.</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warrens colleagues were shocked and wanted him to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Office, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urge the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them reinforce," "said Guglielmi."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help find suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said, the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," "said Guglielmi."</seg>

<seg id="2236">"Convercent received $10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million."</seg>

<seg id="2260">"it starts at 23 o'clock, when a lot of UCLA Footballplayers converse on one side of the new sports fields of the team on campus."</seg>
<seg id="2261">Some have stripped off their tricot tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"for a good part of the team, these hours are a lunch break."</seg>
<seg id="2263">Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three-hour exercise before returning to the water man Football Center the next morning at 6: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"this is a real tread for the guys over the next three days," "said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before the Monday became Tuesday."</seg>
<seg id="2265">"NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of the players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 19: 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise weg from the two days is more than a day when the Brussels postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras's six playing times in Westwood have performed practical exercises.</seg>
<seg id="2268">They are supposed to hold 18 exercises during the month of August. 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their kick-off against Texas A & M in September.</seg>
<seg id="2269">"Mora said that he supported the change in the NCAA, even if they add another point to the multiple-busy routes of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2270">"we put this enormous burden on them three or four days, and it's very challenging," "said Mora."</seg>
<seg id="2271">"and they just pushed it through, they placed on, they are great people."</seg>
<seg id="2272">"I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great."</seg>
<seg id="2273">"UCLA will end its practice as soon as the camp is finished, which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of upscale class, which has already been ejected with footballs, which is a barrier behind a doorpost, will not be an easy task."</seg>
<seg id="2274">"Bruins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season."</seg>
<seg id="2275">"we will use our security," "said Mora."</seg>
<seg id="2276">"this is a real problem, and it's not far fetched to think that people are renting a room there and then set up there to record an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="2277">"if you have the video wall of an exercise, it's a pretty good deal."</seg>
<seg id="2278">"but we have security forces there, and we have security forces at parking 8."</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">"in his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has discovered 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy seat in the Irl River Valley in Kent and is now a inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England" covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Stewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg. "</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: in 2014, he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpected emotional."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb-print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and letters always smell to smoke, because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"for someone who lives 300 years later, the odor has an effect as if he himself was there."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"Oh, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">"for someone who is beaten with old papers, he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle (" To be honest: I have overrated my welcome pit "), it all seems too beautiful to be true."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hydwatchers on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he wandered through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape subjects, gardening and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">Then at night he drank "Whiskey and began to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust first received full access in 2006 when the last Eram, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"when Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the Archive, which he described as" hundreds of years in which aristocrats "said" Oh, throw it on the attic. ""</seg>
<seg id="2308">"journals, letters from the time of English Empires, cards depicting what was said:" you might think that land conflicts would be boring, "says Rhodes," but there was a birch to fight the two families. "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"guys, let's go all the way!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse yourself in the English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built Castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a rebellion that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book titled" "Kniverlightly Families of Kent and Sussex", "says Rhodes."</seg>
<seg id="2312">The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an insurrection was a good start.</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are interconnected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest' that tells the story of the Jesuit patrol that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler' in which the smugglers Arthur Darrell was portrayed from the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"the Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney:" "the gentlemen seemed to be quite a crook, always pay debts and spend money on things they could not afford."</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to advertise."</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his commitment in the castle Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">"he has taken a two-week stay in Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed from nature."</seg>

<seg id="2338">"every year at the beginning of August, in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirement and promotions in the officer corps."</seg>
<seg id="2339">So also this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first sight a normal process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the attempted putsch.</seg>
<seg id="2342">"the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as in the past but in the office of the Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="2343">"under the chairmanship of the Heads of State, the five vice-ministers as well as the Minister for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions."</seg>

<seg id="2345">The government tightens the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">"the Chief of Staff of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the navy were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="2347">"since the failed coup, Erdogan has fired upon Erdogan 169 of the 326 generals and admirals."</seg>
<seg id="2348">"over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged ties to the movement of the Exile Preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as the widow of the coup attempt."</seg>
<seg id="2349">"against 486 people, who were allegedly involved in the attempted putsch, will be negotiated in Ankara since this week."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the overthrow of the" God-Gift, "as he gave him the opportunity to completely cleanse the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have the army under control?</seg>
<seg id="2352">"at the end of February, the newspaper" Hürriyet "published an article with the heading of" discomfort in the military headquarters. ""</seg>
<seg id="2353">"on the general staff there are concerns because of an increasing" Islamization "of the army, which manifests itself among other things in the lifting of the headscarf ban for female soldiers, wrote the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="2354">"in any case, the bulk cleaning in the army and the security forces continues."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in mid-July Erdogan agreed to fire more 7395 national servants per decree, among them 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were formerly known as the lords of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"three times, they pushed them into their role as guardians of the secular state order."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"after his election victory in 2002 Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reform plans of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers argue Erdogan is specifically pushing forward an Islamisation of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">"in the" Vocal Europe "magazine, a particularly unnamed officer, who was seeking asylum after the attempted coup attempt in foreign countries, warned that the Turkish army will be" full of extremists and Salafists in a few years. ""</seg>

<seg id="2375">"just before the end of the year, it is supposed to be built at the ailing route on which the tourist track runs."</seg>
<seg id="2376">"in order to secure the future of the Rennsteishuttles in the long term, according to the Ministry of Transport, construction work will start on the track this year."</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to further order and to rehabilitate the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country commits itself to this important connection, especially for tourism," stated secretary secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt. "</seg>
<seg id="2378">The cost of shortening the route was estimated at around 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">"of this sum, the land surpasses 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="2380">"the contract, on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future from the country, is currently being voted definitive, declared Sühl."</seg>
<seg id="2381">The Ministry and the South Thuringian Railways as an operator are already unanimous about the technical details.</seg>
<seg id="2382">"this means that the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," said Sühl. "</seg>
<seg id="2383">The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This meant that the racing steig shuttle was to be ordered on a regular basis in December 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Rennsteig shuttle is a popular rail link between Ilmenau and Rennsteig.</seg>
<seg id="2386">"in recent months, it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation, whether the route is used by a large number of people to order it in the future."</seg>
<seg id="2387">The track is also very bumpy in parts.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">"just as you thought that 2017 cannot be any more crazy, a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots comes from."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-Founder of FRR, we must start taking up their ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its form of nipple and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun about them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," "said Mr Sharkey in the publication of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone membrane that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also customize his robot according to his beliefs, and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the form of nipples to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it will be more disturbing as many robots have the" "personalities" "that would make a Stepford woman look progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpuppen have developed to robots with a silicone cornea.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealAmbix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxxy Gold Sex-robot developed by True Companion, with preprogrammed personalities such as" Frigid Farrah, "which gives the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxxy Gold has a personality, which is adapted to your personality as well as possible," heats the website of True Companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, be fixed on conversation, or she can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step on Frigid (means here: opposed) Farrah, disturb one the most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website True Companion Roxxxxy is compatible with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxxy?"</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not keep sex robots, and while the FRR noticezes their rising popularity, they remain nonetheless at the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what leaks out of the boundary zones, in relation to the spirit of time in which we live, can be very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strangely or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time in which the rights of women are threatened all over the world, in which there is a president in the White House that has boasted to have women sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the entwined body and the stuffed eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical likeness to actual women as realistic as technically possible (though pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel humanely that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything, which might disturb the imagination of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are pleasing slaves."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the phrase of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps Great Performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">"it has become a rush of the Trump era that the political divisions, which polarized the US voters, also split families in small-format."</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and thanksgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all supposed to meet all of us to place our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of trumps to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">"I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York."</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the republican relationship with which they had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"around the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it is in a further context that this also brings significant risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the issuing effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalisation "and" Trump, "we refer to the stupendous possibility that one day his bibs will no longer be bumped."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"however, there is still a startling long-term scenario, normalized in the Trump Republican of the right wing, which suddenly appears as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"today, I think of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomical version of the decline - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked out) - both compared to Trump in fact seem to be a very mild criminal."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy to qualify as unmeasurable improvement."</seg>
<seg id="2439">"when my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the Carousel in the New York park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"the horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crisp and the animals twisted to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climatical music imparts this in a strange way."</seg>

<seg id="2535">"Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, will go to retirement next year."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"the place is already written out, however, suitable candidates are rare."</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been a master builder for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun as he teaches in the press room.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"he reports of varied, but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor."</seg>
<seg id="2540">"at the same time, he wondered that so far no application has fulfilled the requirements profile."</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or a civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">This should - taking notice of the regular periods of notice - must still be enough time for a revision.</seg>
<seg id="2543">"as Haslach functions for the Administrative Community as a Sub-Building Law Authority, the applicant must prescribe appropriate degrees."</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if it would not be able to fill it out again, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but citizen closeness is important to the city and himself, says Wacker, who reports of a good working climate and good sentiment among authorities and citizens."</seg>
<seg id="2547">"in more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, looking back to the Wacker with pride."</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city worth living," he is confident about the building office and its employees. "</seg>
<seg id="2549">"but also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla-Arezzo and the Niederhofen parking lot are about to be found."</seg>
<seg id="2550">"the Kinzig Bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, but the stadium renovation is still subject."</seg>
<seg id="2551">"the latter will be beating with some 1.5 million euros," if we do it right, "Wacker estimates."</seg>
<seg id="2552">"all in all, great tasks await my successors."</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">"designed for a city-builder, there is ample room for manoeuvre."</seg>
<seg id="2555">"with Haslach's own farm and gardener, many things can be reacted flexibly."</seg>
<seg id="2556">"you can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often referred to by citizens and visitors. "</seg>
<seg id="2557">"as the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to" have an eye on what fits, "when new buildings are approved, the separator Stadtbaumeister emphasises."</seg>
<seg id="2558">"anyway, the urban builder bears high responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="2559">"he is a builder," "in the end everything is running here over my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">"he can count on many years of co-operation with regard to support and coordination: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been doing this for ten years, Manfred Schoer (civil engineering) has been working for 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="2561">"also that his successor stay long, Wacker wishes:" we are looking for someone who truly identifies and wants to stay with the spot. "</seg>
<seg id="2562">"continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2563">"if you want to be buried by Roland Wacker, a completed course of studies as a diploma engineer or a bachelor with subject of architecture should have a degree in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction planning law."</seg>
<seg id="2564">"the Stadtbauamt (Stadtbauamt) stands for civil and civil engineering, building control planning, digressions, administration of municipal property, Municipal Farm with Bauhof and Stadtgardener, as well as Untere Building Law, including monument protection."</seg>

<seg id="2574">"the damage had been repaired on Friday afternoon, rail traffic on the south rail route could be led without disabilities."</seg>
<seg id="2575">"nearly ten passenger trains were off Friday morning, two of them covered distance traffic."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammation)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims just the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and blooms, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while those affected are usually advised to steer meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the gut patrol in order to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the meal do not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells which are able to trigger inflammations are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments were found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell is found in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to destroy the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an diet that is rich in tryptophan promotes tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus when the same system works with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigates a kind of immune cell that fosters tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, but which had not had this."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it suspects that the difference between the intestinal microbiomes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were sequenced DNA sequencing and there were found six bacterial species present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they failed to develop an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they got the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria developed on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri left in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as idol-3-lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of cells increased by around 50 percent, but when tryptophanvalues were halved, the number of cells dropped by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant-promoting cells such as mice and that most of us L. reuteri can protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said:" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophanvalues can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reuteri. "</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that lifts American production last month costs taxpayers according to the military's specifications, which were left to the TIME magazine, up to USD 24.000."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"in addition to a yacht made of Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the Military Office of the White House requested the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the recordings of the marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his supervisor, the deputy marinator for aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the news that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 o'clock in the morning on the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. and so long, until the grass was vacated between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would be required for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the ground."</seg>
<seg id="2724">The recordings provided by TIME were not clear whether a second flight was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits the Federal Government to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Datasets indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked," the Deputy Commandant replied. "</seg>
<seg id="2729">"the" "Made in America" "event was called the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act."</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impetus to reform the health reform, which was going on in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of the airplane known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes.</seg>

<seg id="2736">"the White House is inspired by the Show" Made In America "- the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials," said the deputy secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMX-1 crews frequently carry training flights around Washington and South Lawn to reduce U.S. President in the White House with precise centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="2738">"as Trump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 carried out 58 practice landings at the White House."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event counted for the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said a official."</seg>
<seg id="2740">Helicopter units additionally flew 11 hours this day for "non-presidential support missions."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that the taxpayers took the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not have budgetary names for the Presidential Flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD refund set for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight hour."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter lie far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement rates is most misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual resources."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but also take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at this time, the former spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present this week things made in America," said Spicer. "</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people depend on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2754">"of course, it is appropriate to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour across the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a fire fighter."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the White House, Trump was talking to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products."</seg>

<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesperson for the reform movement" We are Church, "stated after publication against the German press agency, he was expecting from the former Ratzinger Bishop and today Cardinal R. Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emerited Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve to serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger express their deep regret about their own omissions or their false estimate of events at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican paper" "Osservatore Romano" "on the other hand criticized that in reporting on violence against the Domspatzen" "two levels". ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in regard to the attacks in Regensburg, nobody doubts that it is" "shameful and shameful actions" "that would be punished and prevented in the future; however, the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scarponia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk, princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said:" you like to go to the church and that is a prisoner of food. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth" blows a very normal pedagogical means "were" "to be done with friends of children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in the context of reports on abuse, pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger summarized the memorandum" "My brother of the Pope" "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report commissioned by the bishopric Regensburg with the enlightenment commissioned by Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" with high plausibility "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in summary, it can be said that the master of the cathedral was used in many cases of physical and mental violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more intense."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, unlike many other accused, many victims have appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories are linked to him in numerous cases."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of Violence of Violence at the Rins of the Regensburger Domspatzen "gives a contradictory picture of Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand, many students highlight his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, which became tangible to the latter when a domain record musically did not bring top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger ever occurs in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">Only eight pages are devoted to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool also occurred outside of its sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, it is possible to reproach him not to experience it too late or to have taken first hints not seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymnasium, on which it worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents - as literally -" "redemption", "" "heaven" "and" "better world." ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"thus, the vast majority of his disciples Georg Ratzinger publishes an excellent testimony, describes him as" warm-hearted, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding, "as extremely good-natured teachers, who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and" always moved from grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also sometimes led to widening brothers."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he did not only knead with chairs and threw the keyboards on the ground, but also gave ear tips and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he himself had already given years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"in comparison with what this report actually deals, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the preschool, these are dignities."</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders if it is not more likely to do with his acquaintance and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just plunged to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian Pope, many people who have never understood him are still working zealously."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relief Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the context of the report, the media reported a great deal about abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger placed in the final report also any involvement or cooperation with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the cathedral master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," "said one of the sufferers for the others," "It was all very embarrassing for me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the clarification of sexual abuse was and is that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they do not even entrust their parents and siblings, certainly not a choir director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrator professionally."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the scratch-cats do Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned student formulated it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he would have had timely knowledge (Georg Ratzinger) and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that it was accounted for him... boys more urgent or clearer or rather opened than towards their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus, the report concludes with the very clear result:" that the students and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance, could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus exempted from any cooperation."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, he cannot be accused of preventing or having taken him to an ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to connect his good name to these contrasting crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" violence exiles "was to be read in the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former cathedral master Georg Ratzinger is presented in the report "Remover."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed up in the reporting has become a huge detour of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly this is again an abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, it is clean: between the preschool and the grammar school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence and, we say once, other accusations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report covers incidents from time since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir director of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole horrendous test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were properly chipped and painted, all happened at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to prevail."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those he had nothing to do with the cathedral master Georg Ratzinger, for he only got to face the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on the one hand, like most of the witnesses, the subject of" primary school "was taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was indeed discipline, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even positive memories with him in numerous cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most at most the reproach remains to have stowed away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school, where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then only around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger strictly shut the ears off the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out to him," that in the preschool, the prison sentence will continue to be practised. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended an urgent intervention."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, when Prüfer's punishments were banned in Bavaria long ago."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, it occurred in a legal grey area, as each one of us knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to estimate, where the affected persons might be exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permitted limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"however, one cannot say that he had always looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not correct.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the realty of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said, it was unfair to apply today's educational standards to the time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" snare of anachronism, "that is, the risk of evaluating past moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times, and not for what was found in the preschool of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the then usual."</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all very awful and I'm glad that it will finally work up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must protect Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishing the ears and ears, thus far widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then prohibited, he also strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"which picture of his Regensburger Zeit has given Georg Ratzinger once again in talks with you for the book" "My brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of Prüm Penalty also come to speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, that the Domspatzen played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I did not deny that he held a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but this has to be said once: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of Weltrang, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and candy alone one does not make a big singer from rebellious boys and stand before every success, no matter in which area, but always discipline, passion and overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger in talks with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through work on the book and beyond, I really got to know George Ratzinger and again and again as wonderful, humorous, gracious, deeply believing and affectionate people, from whom one could not imagine that he could do something else just a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly get in touch with how many former Domspatzen are still today, 23 years after his emigration, regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"for those who have not forgiven him until today, that he was once strict to them, they are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen are thankful to him today that he enriches their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he was always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respectful person, to which they still look and honoring them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again very clearly: everything you reproach him are educational methods that were then on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just released, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the starting point would resort, a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and without those outside Bavaria and perhaps no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
