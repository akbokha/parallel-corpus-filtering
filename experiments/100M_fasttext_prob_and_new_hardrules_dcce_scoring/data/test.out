28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
&quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping center . &quot;
&quot; the brother of the victim said he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally it went up again with him . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ icia from San Francisco , sharing the medical department in San Francisco . &quot;
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
&quot; brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , shared the ABS channel K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had taken his dream job as a chef in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot;
a speaker of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were shock@@ ed and destroyed at the ground over his death .
&quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gal@@ icia offered that Frank first lived in host@@ els , but that , &quot; things for him finally went up . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; &quot; told Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
Louis Gal@@ icia said he could not imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; connecting his family with his family was to bring us always something to prepare for dinner , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia . &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of conflict .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , who g@@ lowed bright every day , &quot; he said . &quot;
anyone who has the information about the case will be asked to call the relay phone of the SF@@ PD under the 415 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m getting stuck in drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star unmistak@@ ably clear in an interview .
&quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or past@@ ed from outside label , which have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
I myself don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; frank@@ ly , these things are more sn@@ ug to me . &quot;
&quot; Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; , &quot; as explained in the current Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
&quot; ideally , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , a TV with a loose Dut@@ t and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; she raises the question of the wish of the child : &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as an all@@ uring mother of two sons . &quot;
the film runs with us as of August 25 .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger ob@@ tains the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a bit of di@@ version with some colleagues with a ride on the beach . &quot;
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sports Pyram@@ id &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holidays , they hun@@ ted in fast gal@@ lop , home to the feeding stuff . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and so the equ@@ est@@ rian ended up again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers were all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
&quot; he let himself be led with his family through the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even go for photo purposes . &quot;
this was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite impressive .
the German sports aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyram@@ id .
hon@@ ors do not lack the sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic ath@@ lete .
&quot; Grand Cross , Silver Lau@@ rel leaf , Champions Tour Player of the Year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already spotted him .
a long time is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid .
&quot; on Saturday , he met Hans Günter Win@@ kler in Aachen on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means very much to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talent for decades .
&quot; and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros immediately . &quot;
&quot; with 15 outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master winner was added to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the members include the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ engen , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ derer Hans Han@@ isch , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the j@@ umper Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the hand b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustr@@ ative society w@@ anders into the spr@@ ing@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza prize went . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and m@@ umps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trade deal - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; the two US presidential candidates , however , are un@@ aware of the tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are a basic , more philosophical difference . &quot;
on the role of the state .
&quot; in doubt , Tr@@ ump wants to remain small in doubt and war@@ ns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , cla@@ iming Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely withdraw regulations , and he makes for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for private individuals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton says , &quot; &quot; The state has certain tasks to fulfill , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , they say . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in this case , Tr@@ ump and Clinton are almost wor@@ sen@@ ing . &quot;
the democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly denied by the rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the state @-@ critical team of Te@@ apart@@ y .
&quot; in Tr@@ ump , there could also be partial @-@ party discussions . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and res@@ ume production of coal mining in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas to den@@ ounce the Paris climate agreement .
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend and demand renew@@ ables with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ fic trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , they both don &apos;t want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better . &quot;
&quot; they are to be paid even better , demands about Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a wage for hunger .
he wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to be r@@ ins@@ ed , then he says he should not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months seems likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth . &quot;
his critics argue that the budget deficit would only increase .
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , at least wanting from the rich wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every woman who has fled has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is part of women who are fle@@ eing themselves , almost everyday . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traum@@ ati@@ zed . &quot;
a house provides refuge .
in a large kitchen four women sit .
each one has a baby at the most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arms .
he looks curi@@ ously in the space with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she realis@@ es that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles shortly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is a business leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier of social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs created the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Münchner Frauen@@ hilfe . &quot;
it has been officially opened for a long time .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - neither as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has made experiences on her flight experience with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persec@@ uted politically , because torture or death thre@@ aten them or because their families send them as hop@@ eful@@ s to Europe , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in women , other reasons for escape : &quot; many ste@@ al secre@@ tly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sion , murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
on the run this goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end as soon as they arrive in Germany , ir@@ re , says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ used at worst . &quot;
&quot; this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traum@@ ati@@ zed , they appreciate . &quot;
&quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so ac@@ custom@@ ed to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience , because shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they often don &apos;t know how to help , I need more accommodations only for them , demands B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district regi@@ stran@@ ts are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the question of whether or not they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Francon@@ ia , there is something like that in accommodations of governments . &quot;
&quot; in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , women who have escaped are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Francon@@ ia there are some common shel@@ ters or houses for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the Committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women will be shel@@ tered separately . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy is missing or are housed together men and women , it can - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel this need of protection can be seen at the rush , which there is to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has been talking about us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily set up a second house .
assist@@ ants argue : demands for new work fighting measures
Deputy of the assistant physicians have called their union to appro@@ ve new work fighting measures in their dispute with regard to a new contract .
the J@@ DC &apos;s Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) called for its complete council to appro@@ ve more labour competition measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC suggested that ministers had failed to address the concerns of the contract .
&quot; in July , assistant physicians and medical students agreed to reject a contract agreed with the B@@ MA . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who had been published on Twitter Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; &quot; pers@@ ky quiet &quot; &quot; issues , which led to the fact that the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; given this , the J@@ DC Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and solic@@ it official new negotiations for all your worries . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today set a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council in order to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating labour competition measures that begin at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the dispute ended that assistant physicians were argu@@ ing six times this year , the first total out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
the head of the B@@ MA assistant physicians Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the B@@ MA .
&quot; he granted B@@ MA members during the meetings , which were still held before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants and medical students , to ensure that the contract was beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; following the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
&quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands , and to proc@@ laim an official end to the eight month long war of words and economic sanctions . &quot;
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ part in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny myself the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles were mi@@ sty and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an , however , spoke repeatedly of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot;
I could not count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but to improve themselves . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an beha@@ ved as if it had never happened . &quot;
his enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s brilliant , sustainable refriger@@ ation showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was floo@@ ded .
Putin ex@@ pi@@ red and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even bigger since it was done by a supposed friend .
re@@ building the confidence will be difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media ran a heavy , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
at one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for all .
&quot; the accus@@ ations by leading officials were the most serious accus@@ ations that Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St. Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look ahead . &quot;
&quot; after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear from the President Erd@@ og@@ an . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious . &quot;
Erd@@ og@@ an mainly needs all the friends he can get after having been dismis@@ sed at a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat last month .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shock@@ ed him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved if the flights are res@@ um@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti expressed it as follows : &quot; tourists there lang , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West because its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power was regarded as a weak response .
&quot; to this end , the ongoing gru@@ dge of the EU accession negotiations and Putin &apos;s s@@ nail pace will continue to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot;
the Russian Head of State won in Ankara with security a bonus for calling for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
&quot; this is well @-@ evident for Moscow , a matter of course , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of reg@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; : two countries that have been viol@@ ating and treated badly from the West and are now alli@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played the role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both pres@@ idents spoke at the press conference that they didn &apos;t even cope with the issue .
&quot; the President of Turkey refused to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey explo@@ ded the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s Chief Executive Officer , R@@ BS will only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the Bank has since dis@@ soci@@ ated itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; at this time , brand strateg@@ ists &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer credits . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds at sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don W@@ inner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now it has decided to put more national brands into focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the stock exchange are to be changed to Nat@@ west@@ . &quot;
the trademark Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for the retail business that will have more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the Bank became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now I am saying that we do not pursue any global goals , but also local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already announced that its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship will no longer be carried away and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the Bank of Brands , as how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
&quot; but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these marks again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.@@ 000@@ th gain at New@@ market on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ yed champagne after a double at New@@ market , which adds 3,@@ 000@@ th prize to him &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British gain at New@@ market . &quot;
&quot; he applied at Pre@@ dil@@ ection , trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , which reaches the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won in front of G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened to New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori pic@@ ks up the che@@ er when he wins the victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ eys met the milestone in the steep@@ le ch@@ ase - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved over 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger , had 4.@@ 4@@ 93 career opportunities &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone which has reached only a few before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for the race , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma enthusias@@ tically received fans for this sport for many years . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already gotten 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden 30 years winner in GB what is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve w@@ re@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of great tur@@ ni@@ es , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a crash @-@ crash and got a ban on drug prohibition . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulty in the beginning when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form . &quot;
and he &apos;s not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his least fifty years of age .
Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly released his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ d@@ antes .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed a Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin allegedly ordered Ivan@@ ov@@ s dism@@ iss@@ al of his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ a@@ ino , who has been Deputy Director since 2012 , has been appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ a@@ ino , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in Tallinn in 1972 , he graduated at the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum . &quot;
&quot; on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was the principal of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer . &quot;
he told Putin about his nom@@ ination : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it &apos;s the government &apos;s most important task to support your work as Head of State in respect of the draft laws and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV broad@@ ca@@ ster on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and V@@ a@@ ino recommended as his successor .
persu@@ ade the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has taken place in Moscow in a mysterious way .
&quot; for a long time , Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest confi@@ d@@ ants to Vladimir Putin and worked as he was for Soviet intelligence , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff left their own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official asser@@ tion that a man who was once tou@@ ted as a potential president at once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - ran across large scep@@ ticism .
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , which are cited on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated job - you could almost say - troubles@@ ome items for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
prior to that he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin a former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; as Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted in most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could be president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;

puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a Ban@@ ff resident required help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
&quot; Kevin Ba@@ in thinks that there could be 75 fish for San@@ da@@ ale , which were mirr@@ ored by a fountain . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Ba@@ in , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings to the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; ceiling fans &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion in order to approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 obli@@ que cables . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister Keith Brown today made a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment in the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings building .
&quot; we are all the witnesses of an engineering of a truly epic proportions in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total deck are at their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete g@@ ong for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first sh@@ utter represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; in this fantastic project , the closure is a forward @-@ looking high and low construction . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last street covering and its connection with the expansion of the northern tower , we had to close the existing gap on the north or south side . &quot;
this was reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 metres long , weighs around 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at a gra@@ dient of approx . 3 % . &quot;
&quot; since the toler@@ ances on which the team were working tiny , they were only a few milli@@ metres on each side . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
salvation in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot; after they were thrown from Angl@@ es@@ ey by their fishing boat .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI b@@ ail@@ out station struck Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST Alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; we saw how the boat sp@@ un around us and presented the worst , &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach until we left the water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boat without life@@ jacket . &quot;
they were all aboard the rescue boat and returned to the rescue station
&quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water were lucky , and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop , but it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who ste@@ ered the boat . &quot;
someone wo@@ ke up today about these men .
hard hurt - man suff@@ ers to his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man has attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
&quot; as the police said yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal affairs . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcoholic perpet@@ r@@ ator cuts the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police could arrest the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend , he called his mother . &quot;
she then al@@ armed his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her companions .
&quot; on the street , they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ partner . &quot;
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 year old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend . &quot;
who is building cheap apartments ?
the German Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) and the Gre@@ ens believe that investors should be put into duty much more strongly in the future .
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 low @-@ priced apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; at the next session of the session , the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; Action Concept &quot; &quot; concept . &quot;
but quar@@ rel is programmed .
first of all it is about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; SPD faction leader Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas must prove 20 percent of all flats as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be found in the inventory . &quot;
&quot; however , the main point of dispute in the town hall is , as Brat@@ mann says : &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private land ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as less as 20 percent of homes as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new municipal housing funding programme , which will cost millions of dollars and still need to be financed , should provide incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , such as Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make a few pres@@ crip@@ tions to investors .
the left wants even harder editions for investors .
&quot; regardless of that , so Brat@@ mann , a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is uncle@@ ar whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; however , the programme is not entirely new : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how do you compare the loss of some 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments , whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the coming years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this from happening , the planning @-@ policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be bought ongoing ties from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to the price . &quot;
this is possible in the western town .
at one blow the problem could be solved .
&quot; because in the western town , dead@@ lines run at the end of the year . &quot;
around 1800 dwell@@ ings you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : this is what the owners , the housing companies do not want . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the western city is increased dramatically , one is from the aim of the so @-@ called mixing . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke comments : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot;
this has concentrated on more construction sites for single @-@ family houses .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not yet be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness which is worthwhile &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; teenagers and children no longer go outside to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens , star@@ ing on screens , has been lam@@ ented by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time at the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on vide@@ og@@ ames and most recently on smartphones . &quot;
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
&quot; of course I refer to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later they created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop culture decreased interest before the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ load the servers .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they were found &quot; &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile ) or &quot; &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the del@@ usion and jump@@ ed for the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person re@@ counts every day . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 3@@ 5.000 users , recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of tracking people who practice 30 minutes each day , jump@@ ed from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - only the raw data for performance improvement .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to take &quot; &quot; 30 minutes of time &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; get active each day &quot; &quot; bit@@ ing on de@@ af ears , because many public messages are boring for health and come from people that look appealing . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
anyone driving sports regularly reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here . &quot;
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even include new friend@@ ships during the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are also m@@ alo@@ gies that have to compla@@ in about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what &apos;s it ?
a breakthrough happened .
&quot; even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could already track our activity before , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be reproduced over time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ages
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all the im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
stun@@ n@@ ingly on the ground .
brilliant on the whole line .
and now finally the Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast grew into a multi @-@ battle title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes below the head@@ light of the Olympic Games .
&quot; her total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; teams A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa . &quot;
&quot; the Americans of Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ mo@@ il on the Swedish bar during the single @-@ prolifer@@ ation campaign of women at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Games , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a multi @-@ battle title , and the fifth as she consoli@@ dates her reputation of being the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as Michael P@@ helps , who have brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years , dominated by 15 world champion@@ ships - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rett@@ on of her said she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it awa@@ ited her last examination in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered a dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women , Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace , having won gold and silver in the single @-@ multi@@ fight arena of women in the summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ a took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as a ex@@ clamation mark on the f@@ arewell party of the retired team coordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ jana insi@@ sted that during her long journey to the top , never to have planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
part of her floor exercises - which contain her typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not accidental .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a training in the gym@@ nasi@@ um , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she hasn &apos;t lost any competition competition , a series of victory that will continue as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even though must@@ af@@ ina slightly led through two turns , the picture we@@ pt . &quot;
Swedish Be@@ ams and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - where Bil@@ es holds the title of World Championships - lau@@ ded .
&quot; she repeated with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the ste@@ amer - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor still one on it . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her end result - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears flow@@ ed on Bil@@ a shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book book . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man &apos;s performance was ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Must@@ afa in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her so@@ b@@ ness , she threw the audience of kis@@ ses , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly expanding twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds from the beginning of this week has a very new meaning : &quot;
police : 3 victims in serial killer case shot in the car in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first mass mur@@ der@@ ous crime of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm while he stood on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
&quot; the police said that the triple murder seems not to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y over anything , since the Att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were owned by one of the adult victims . &quot;
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting took the investig@@ ators to get a closer look at whether it is connected to four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks during four months , and two more wounded . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ect has used several vehicles , including a brown Niss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence , which led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting which went on an empty pickup truck for half an hour before the triple murder and from which it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ü@@ sen and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the least of his contem@@ por@@ aries Ed@@ mund Micro@@ enc@@ ephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he first came home , my first thought was , I don &apos;t manage it . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage it .
I did not let myself in .
&quot; what is not true at all -- of course , one has got into it , &quot; she said . &quot;
Vincent and her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund could never recognize them under certain circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer to this was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do &apos; , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking assistant .
Ed@@ mund was neither able to sit nor cr@@ ab@@ ble until his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but it is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language Ed@@ mund conceived for &quot; &quot; Please sing me something &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing language , &quot; pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund had invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to rec@@ alls the emotional cost of an uncertain future .
I wonder@@ ed what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t really know .
&quot; I have been asking for the pro@@ g@@ nosis since a long time , because I don &apos;t expect anyone to really tell me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the virus virus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives cause for b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ is@@ iana , Mississi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ds in Lou@@ is@@ iana forced the governor to proc@@ laim the emergency room on Friday . it is expected all Saturday about more ra@@ inf@@ alls .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ is@@ i@@ anas and the south of the Mississi@@ ppi floo@@ ded its banks and threatened with large @-@ area floo@@ ds to extreme ra@@ inf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
the governor of Lou@@ is@@ iana John B@@ el Ed@@ wards informed that government officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help the communities concerned .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness , announced that the requests for flood vessels , boats and sand bags were increased . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a floo@@ ding warning system is used over large parts in the south of Lou@@ is@@ i@@ anas until Saturday .
the weather service had vo@@ iced alarm that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches might fall to rain .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama there was a flood warning system on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the Mobile Area . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ité near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite close to Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ is@@ iana , will probably be reached after the weekend record level . &quot;
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many homes in the for@@ ts near Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that a stream directed floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as the floo@@ ded rivers flow slowly into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the River Tick@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ is@@ iana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was recorded ever . &quot;
rescue teams still sli@@ pped people from the flood in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the south @-@ west of Mississi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rose strongly over night . &quot;
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; we are awake and the water was streaming and streaming in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a plateau of the river in the 48 years , in which she lived there . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that the emergency hel@@ pers had res@@ cu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had collap@@ sed rapidly , as there were still serious ra@@ inf@@ alls and that the authorities were hes@@ it@@ ant to take account of ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer met in the proximity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning from 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground was considerably su@@ cked by the ra@@ inf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa par@@ ish and teaching crew in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an ordered in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had attacked 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which now both were floo@@ ded .
&quot; the leader of Rob@@ by Miller , said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven pets , washed by floo@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency accommodations were established to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to the floo@@ ded water and provided sand@@ bags for the people to take along , hoping to be able to keep the water out of their homes and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last great flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Mississi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses were reported to be in@@ und@@ ated on Thursday , but on Friday no entries were reported . &quot;
&quot; Keith Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; perfor@@ ated by balls &quot; , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police tell us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents gave that brown suffered several shot legs , including in the loin , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in hospital during his transport . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his little body was perfor@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; he shared his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered cri@@ tically in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the broad@@ ca@@ ster that he is expected to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 year old .
one of the 29 year old men is in a critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who was found in a critical condition , reported the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police precisely determined whether among one of the injured men the perpet@@ rators could find themselves .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
&quot; cartridge sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to different assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ se@@ wed the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were seals . &quot;
&quot; so it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; &quot; said police assistant Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the station . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no arrest and the police report@@ edly reviewed the surveillance video .
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross @-@ ra@@ cket in the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police still looks for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone and Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the gym@@ nas@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 , and the USA has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second : this team has three tur@@ ner , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is Catho@@ licon , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally mirrors the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic feminine presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among the female gym@@ n@@ uns was an American A@@ fr@@ o American . &quot;
last year were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic med@@ alist and America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple World Championships , Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they provided unexpected but master@@ ful gym@@ n@@ astic routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who won gold at an individual multi @-@ battle rally for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but so the gym@@ nas@@ tics classes in the whole country do not look out . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all kick@@ ed off the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to join the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gym@@ n@@ sts in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is that gym@@ nas@@ tics are a more expensive sport and gym@@ na@@ sts in the first place in private gym@@ nas@@ tics which are maintained by parents who pay for training , orientation , travel , clothing , competitive and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) . the list can be continued as desired . &quot;
the majority of these sports clubs are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these associations , the gym@@ na@@ sts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started with the gym@@ nas@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to offer the communities au@@ n inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ access gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
I founded my turn@@ sti@@ le of 20 years .
&quot; for my events , we have offered free and affordable gym@@ nas@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and train national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gym@@ nas@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this fantastic Olympic sports . &quot;
&quot; gym@@ nas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long advantages for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team to bring thousands of young girls interested in the gym@@ nas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gold and thanks , you are motivated as many young girls with varying backgrounds to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistant physicians want to organize additional strikes after they have rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts suggestion
&quot; the ministers had hoped to terminate the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the British Medical Association &apos;s function@@ aries , but 58 percent of the 37,@@ 000 assist@@ ants voting at a vote rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July H@@ unt announced plans to introduce the Treaty and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistant physicians will receive a new contract , which includes changes to bed@@ side and weekend work to improve the care for un@@ changing hours . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the B@@ MA committees for resident physicians , informed the last night in a message : &quot; &quot; assistance specialists have serious concerns about the proposed treaty , in particular that it will inc@@ ur the current occupation crisis and to admini@@ ster it all the doctors . &quot;
&quot; with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the B@@ MA to resolve disputes by discussions broke with the government on the contrary to take part and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened to a promise that Jerem@@ y H@@ unt had made last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y H@@ unt needs to act now , lift up the up@@ swing and address the concerns of the assistant physicians . &quot;
&quot; should he not do so , the assistant physicians have made clear that they are ready to carry out additional work campaigns . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a sur@@ ge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , since nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in gran@@ ting doctors on the stri@@ k@@ post chain . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to terminate the dispute over the changes made by the adoption of the re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the B@@ MA would like to have a better week pay for the 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants that are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of N@@ HS collabor@@ ators , urged the assistant physicians to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; labour combat measures achieve nothing but little , but already strain over@@ bur@@ dened teams and service providers and prepare patients , peac@@ ek@@ ee@@ pers and their families worries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the committee of the assistance specialists and responded positively to concerns about the tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; the employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training camps , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training camps and the Ministry of Health relating to compliance with B@@ MA in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ pro daily drug that can lower the risk of heart attacks
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ inflammatory drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack . &quot;
the regulatory authority NI@@ CE of the N@@ HS recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory authority NI@@ CE of the N@@ HS recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or a stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls .
&quot; when the flooring breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that c@@ log the blood flow to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots trigger , it can flow through the blood stream and c@@ log the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
people who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more impro@@ b@@ able .
&quot; the draft of NI@@ CE , published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the NI@@ CE Health Technology Assessment Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack , have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person .
&quot; the experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes with people who already had a heart attack . &quot;
by the preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years . the draft bill does not recommend any treatment beyond that period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness to flour@@ ish election fraud in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was removed from office last year due to corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness has led to wi@@ ping broad@@ ly widespread dec@@ eption in Muslim communities as a crus@@ hing government report today revealed .
&quot; Sir Eric Pic@@ kles , former cabinet member , attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town halls to ignore evidence of election abuse as a result of &quot; intoler@@ ances concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and local government , which is now an anti @-@ corruption sc@@ andal , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters out of religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut @-@ off bands outside of electoral college to protect inti@@ mid@@ ated voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should lead a proof to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must simply call his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable inks to a person &apos;s finger , when they leave their vote to prevent someone to vote twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he ur@@ ges that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or work@@ groups .
&quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the municipal government against the wider corruption and financial culture that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Wahl@@ sk@@ and@@ als in eastern London .
&quot; last year , a special electoral court decided that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be dismis@@ sed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would have brought his critics to silence with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia accus@@ ations .
&quot; Rah@@ man is said to &quot; &quot; have led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation , in which one person was chosen as someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent correspondence - in which older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the poll@@ ing system , including the driving license to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in its report it is said : &quot; &quot; evidence was attached that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or b@@ ang@@ lad@@ ian background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions have unknow@@ ingly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; politically correct &quot; in@@ sensitivity in respect of eth@@ ni@@ cs and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists deal with brief@@ ing documents to stop &quot; &quot; harvesting harv@@ ests &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report taken into consideration by Ther@@ esa May requires tough@@ er registration checks , in order to prevent the electoral index to be used for immigration and social security purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone choosing twice .
systematic reviews about the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic correspondence .
ban that political activists deal with full post @-@ elections and envel@@ opes of post@@ elections .
the police have the power to set off lock@@ outs for election stations .
a amend@@ ment made by an indictment for inti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the repression of the People Act 1983 .
photographer prohibition in election stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the voting stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees rule out that voters alone go to the El@@ ection Cab@@ in .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case no criminal complaint was put .
&quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ usable , &quot; he said . &quot;
it was found guilty due to a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; check@@ points &quot; of the election regi@@ sters of the Town Hall .
&quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; The judgment in Tower Ham@@ lets of last year was a warning signal . &quot;
&quot; our country carries a proud heritage as the mother of the parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and hidden spread of election fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
mad about K@@ ate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ lern in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio will be amazed at Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot who proved to be an impressive Doppel@@ gän@@ ger der Herz@@ og@@ in of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only ath@@ lete who has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media .
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic games that feature more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the Hunter and the Wolf : team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared since childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ate Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the rac@@ et@@ rack , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain arch@@ ers of the twin from A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio might be . &quot;
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks like the Wolf of Wall Street Star sc@@ ary .
&quot; in fact , the arch@@ ers got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see much simil@@ arity , except for facial hair , &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I feel that probably as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British femin@@ ist Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes should go through as a Doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cub@@ an @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
and in the pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh have been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; one course higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; of the inc@@ eption acting actor &quot;
&quot; another decent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
Russian silver medal s@@ wimm@@ ers Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points out more than just the sun tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord while American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested to an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
&quot; strong women : soccer star hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy about the fact that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
&quot; theory into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair . &quot;
&quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction , that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons covered K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in gym@@ nas@@ tics Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ ess died as a pig
B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis over the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ estyle swimming tru@@ ffle bri@@ cked viewers of the C@@ BC live transmission of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical games on Wednesday
&quot; Canadian broad@@ ca@@ ster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ ess &quot; &quot; retired &quot; &quot; and during the race as &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when he finishes his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m release .
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who was caught in the team &apos;s commentary team on board to give more &quot; colour , &quot; you could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; excited , as he called M@@ ief , died like a pig . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; the Chinese float in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the Flo@@ ating Cup 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1,@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor pack , which enabled the Canadian to close the gap to China . &quot;
spectators across Canada were quickly re@@ acting online after they were shock@@ ed by the sound and the language
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane Twe@@ ete , &quot; Do@@ es the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that 14 @-@ year @-@ old son &apos;s son died from China &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot;
the idi@@ ot did not get that they were still on show .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows in the fin@@ als 4 x 200m free @-@ style s@@ quad@@ ron for women as follows : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the review of B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard at which many people asked him
Twitter users did not stop when they heard how un@@ si@@ ze@@ able B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter User@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like ra@@ cists . # hired .
&quot; short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comments of Mac@@ Donald , said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment was broadcast about a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding , sorry that it happened . &quot;
&quot; in the end , C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for 90 times to people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ kt about Twitter &quot;
the comment@@ ator &apos;s colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who had compla@@ ined about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave out a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible that it was broadcast .
&quot; yesterday night , we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audience on show and our followers in the social media . &quot;
&quot; to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments relate to the performance of the float in and not on it as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding . B@@ yr@@ on is very sorry about what he said . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal assault . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s pool in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have referred to the performance of float in and not on it as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark swe@@ ars by woman who has under@@ gone under@@ wear in the middle of the business
&quot; the buyers did not know where to look , when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try sub@@ h@@ osen . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she mu@@ stered as she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back into the shelf . &quot;
they continued kno@@ cking and rehear@@ sed four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone , where the woman ta@@ sted the under@@ pants before she put it back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was in store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had under@@ gone under@@ wear , she would go again and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out their own tr@@ unc@@ ated pants and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put it back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three further under@@ pants , before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t want anything to come back and went out . &quot;
&quot; she did not seem to distur@@ b that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person , which could possibly buy the under@@ pants which she had tried . &quot;
&quot; Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take under@@ pants with home that had another person and who were not washed away . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; as I received , the employees tried to pull the garments from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and she didn &apos;t get washed .
&quot; a spokes@@ man from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is the case , which happened on Tuesday 9th August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapon attacks
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com might make it a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Network in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if you approach you from behind , then you should first turn around so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; go out of the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; take it then with your knee to the bar and twi@@ sting while the att@@ acker breaks up against pain , the weapon comes out of his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards , while she direc@@ ts the weapon to him . &quot;
&quot; when att@@ ack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the weapon and twi@@ sting it , so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and beat the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and direc@@ ting the weapon to it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video in order to see exactly what it is doing Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; but remember that in a rob@@ ber@@ y , it is the saf@@ est to hand over your money - unless you are a Grand@@ master &apos;s grand@@ master . &quot;
traveler Ian W@@ right disgu@@ ises his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British traveler under@@ went a serious test of his immune system and stran@@ gl@@ ehold by det@@ ecting some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the host and travel writer Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k put his course on a Euro ticket , a rail@@ ing on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a traction toilet as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of its immune system . &quot;
&quot; prior to the le@@ ak@@ age of each object , he used a phot@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to do . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was scre@@ ened under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought of de@@ bac@@ ing the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a tow@@ ing toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely ab@@ rup@@ tive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals on the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he ta@@ sted , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ el , traveling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to train stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task presented its immune system defini@@ tively under a sample &quot;
&quot; he told me in the film : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and slu@@ dge water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he justified his reputation in any case . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its sample line showed a lumin@@ ometer number of over 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the number of newly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to refuse after their L@@ umin@@ ometer numbers were over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; , &quot; which shows the bacterial count at different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film , he says : &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I have ger@@ min@@ ated in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I &apos;m not going to lick here anything because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us that contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system .
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explain the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
we introduced crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film direc@@ ting , added : &quot; let me tell me this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I had instruc@@ ted him , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to put them off and others where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents identified lac@@ tic acid bacteria particularly with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing mil@@ ks@@ aci@@ al bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destro@@ ys in front of del@@ o@@ gi@@ ance social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left her social apartment after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ance with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ bury were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , the housing association created the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls had cla@@ d holes , wooden boards were ri@@ pped , tr@@ ash was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was decorated on the walls . &quot;
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they now live in a private housing
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the property management at Corn@@ wall Housing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is likely to be considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is as well .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror which the family had added , street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all bats , inti@@ mid@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking , and excessive scre@@ ams , strikes and cur@@ ses included . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate , where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden boards were ri@@ pped up &quot;
neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly inv@@ oked the police
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ o@@ gi@@ d her and her partner for@@ ci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They were not afraid of anyone . &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police were called peri@@ odic , 20 years long &quot;
on the over@@ grown side of the community house gar@@ bage and old toys were thrown down
&quot; he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family , as del@@ o@@ gi@@ ance is always the final step to consider Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and had to be horri@@ ble for their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have courage@@ ously listened to us and have given us the information . &quot;
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and conve@@ ys the message that anti @-@ social behavior is not toler@@ ated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;

&quot; in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ als and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ by received a fine after having found guilty of own@@ ing a class B drug .
&quot; she claimed that the money was for a grave of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; having been without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many walls of the house were gra@@ ded with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police said they will navigate the r@@ enters who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall informed that Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ ach , as well as those who were har@@ med by such a behavior , &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists come to panic in Portugal after flying a public jet on the beach
&quot; sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal witnessed the shock of their lives &quot;
an portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on air@@ plane of the air@@ strip put an unbelievable crash
&quot; the air forces admitted that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that no security risk was pre@@ cluded &quot;
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start panic after a public jet comes down over a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed how the military air@@ plane flew close to the sun wor@@ ship@@ pers on the beach in Av@@ eiro in northern Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jump@@ ed up when they started to worry about the noise of the jet engines , without first seeing what came through the clouds on them . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos on the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
N@@ uno arro@@ ya added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would drop down on me .
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were terri@@ fied when the plane came out of the dark and incredibly low .
&quot; today , the Portuguese air forces announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fis@@ her boats off the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that due to the poor visibility of the area , the jet flew lower than usual , but the air forces insi@@ sted that safety was at no time at risk . &quot;
&quot; the area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , with four people on the island of Madeira to death . &quot;
&quot; today , the Portuguese air forces announced that the pilot had to fly as deep as possible because of the conditions - heavy fog and smoke - which limits his view &quot;
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fis@@ her boats as part of the exercise

also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter Ste@@ gen is also missing .
&quot; the German suffered a deviation in the knee during the training , thus clari@@ fying the demand for Bar@@ ca at least for the benefit of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er Ste@@ gen won the status as number one in Barcelona for two years .
&quot; coach Luis En@@ ri@@ que refra@@ ined from making a clear decision until now and left Bra@@ vo in the League , but for that T@@ er Ste@@ gen in most other applications took the lead . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory play of the new season , the Spanish teacher doubts about the fitness level of the team , which was sub@@ du@@ ed in a test game of Liverpool at 0 : 4 on Saturday . &quot;
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not know yet at 3 : 2 in Pro@@ gen@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday .

mA Long in an own league to table tennis Gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma long is the new table tennis tournament winner .
&quot; on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated their fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the World @-@ Ran@@ king first took the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with success at the World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ al@@ Tournament and just Olympia . &quot;
bronze was going to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ pe@@ ani .
the two Chinese managed it as expected and made the title with each other .
&quot; it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings . &quot;
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympia @-@ podium was the former SV@@ S N@@ Ö legi@@ onna@@ ire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; mA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the disk , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no coaches with them . &quot;
they had with@@ drawn into the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ ectors in a fair competition alone .
&quot; the mat@@ ches to this place , I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang had said consequently . &quot;
&quot; after the game , Gold@@ - and Silver medal winner with the China Flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
mA had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first movement .
&quot; after that , he set the pace on the record and left Z@@ hang only a total of 13 points . &quot;
the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected thrilling match .
&quot; nevertheless , there were still enough stunning ball changes to be seen . &quot;
Miz@@ ra@@ ani won the Bronze Class against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had with@@ drawn a ri@@ b injury in his quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als against the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , had to &quot; end &quot; with sheet metal . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the Swedish Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) had become Olympia @-@ V@@ ate in a similar way . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump gives &quot; huge problems &quot; in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the U.S. Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditionally conservative states . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now short@@ com@@ ings of his election campaign in the so @-@ called republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire spoke as something as concerns as correspon@@ dents reported .
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals in the republi@@ can camp from the race , the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for assistance in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; due to false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he again took up his well @-@ known media sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed . &quot;
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds w@@ ob@@ ble
U@@ tah is normally a secure bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ or in June , Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor were alike from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump in the front , but not with the distance that is common to republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot;
&quot; as endangered , Arizona and Georgia are also endangered . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with the Sender @-@ C , Tr@@ ump answered the question as to how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; and if afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; either successful &quot; &quot; or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he makes no difference as &quot; telling the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it does not suff@@ ice for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be that in order , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party allegedly threatened to cancel funds to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present a better survey . &quot;
&quot; instead of this , the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans will be stronger than their arms for Congress . &quot;
Olympics : three che@@ ating at D@@ oping Test
the IO@@ C intends to establish a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face disaster after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee was informed promptly to establish a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan officials announced that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine test in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i . &quot;
this was reported to the team leader Ken@@ yan by the dop@@ ing control agencies .
IA@@ AF World Federation has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to pursue its own investigations and shared an IA@@ AF representative .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures taken by the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will conduct an assessment , &quot; it was said in an IA@@ AF Declaration . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and , as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , issued and signed the sample , &quot; explained Ken@@ yan Chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete who stood on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i had become over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
&quot; four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Athle@@ tics delegation leader Michael Rot@@ er had been with@@ drawn from the Rio Olympics . &quot;
he is supposed to have informed sports@@ men of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
Ash@@ ur@@ st Firm of the Year for Private Construction Luther Firm of the Year for Energy
Kenya has been under particular observation at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing off@@ ences for some time .
&quot; at the announcement of the more than 2,000 dop@@ ing control checks submitted by IO@@ C before the Rio Olympics , it was usually pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot;
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer Olympics in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic launch .
&quot; as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya took part in the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control was compliant with the rules of the WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports of the ARD , repro@@ aches were repeatedly raised , that dop@@ ing agents are easily accessible and there should be a significant ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ting . &quot;
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired them in Russian athle@@ tics .
&quot; in doing so , it was possible to prove that in this sport @-@ type area coverage and systematically dimin@@ ished . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athletes were subsequently exp@@ elled from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Year the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic lover couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with this a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Maria a youth dream .
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Am@@ ber &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary . &quot;
she re@@ members with sad@@ ness to her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because musi@@ cally they are extraordinary ! &quot;
and then there would be Mari@@ as personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so she is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passi@@ on@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to me , my Italian character , which I used as a Roman , &quot; &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli . &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an enorm@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in each of its movements , in his looks , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with it .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley , the &quot; West Side Story &quot; is up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with preju@@ di@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today , we have the refugees , then the D@@ oss S@@ acher went to New York and the New York residents didn &apos;t want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as they did at that time . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
&quot; London school@@ girl , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; Ka@@ di@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer , Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago her family passed away from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air@@ strike in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , reported IT@@ V news on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had anticipated to leave the country @-@ operated country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from east London got into a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sult@@ anas &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a wi@@ dow .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain in the case of election victory at Gar@@ land as candidates for the Supreme Court
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the democr@@ ats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton will nom@@ inate Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked the country &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell is the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge of the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to choose &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; with a certain amount of certainty . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
&quot; he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate . &quot;
Gar@@ land is the supreme judge for the US Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said , Rep@@ ublic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ land nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of Republi@@ can presidential candidates Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;

the Tre@@ ats Magazine works with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to bring out a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked human beings , they want to find the next generation of top@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his n@@ ape magazine of Old@@ school Play@@ boy distinguishes himself , because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
&quot; apparently , he believes that the calendar also does . &quot;
&quot; we need to return to the portra@@ yal of timeless and classical nude , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release for the publication of the Cal@@ end@@ ars . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or in person at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish municipality counts with mass flight
&quot; whoever does not fit and lo@@ oses Erd@@ og@@ an sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
the Kur@@ dish community of Germany pays tribute to tens of thousands of people who escape from Turkey to Germany at short notice .
&quot; in the medium term , it might even become &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; the president of the Association believes Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; due to the harsh taste of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an after the attempted put@@ sch , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with a few hundred thousand protection @-@ seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erd@@ og@@ an regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the remaining Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; on Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had already out@@ stri@@ pped Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds with sanctions , 500,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing within Turkey . &quot;
&quot; after the ou@@ sted coup , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added . &quot;
many will want to restart in Europe if they are further repres@@ sed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that even takes refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot;
&quot; the ban@@ dage leader compla@@ ined of the systematic res@@ ett@@ lement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Erd@@ og@@ an wants to increase the out@@ liers to the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
the German government demanded that the Federal Government is positioned as sharp@@ ly as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and its followers .
also in Germany a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an @-@ critic takes place .
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len practitioner destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not fit and lo@@ oses Erd@@ og@@ an sits on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ affiliated Foundation Dialog and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as reported by the newspaper calling on numbers of the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks introduced the largest group of asylum holders for political persecution in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; on June 30 , this was 11,@@ 386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all as as@@ yl@@ ated purchases ( 39.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this collection there are not those who escaped from war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum Rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persec@@ uted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer election campaign - and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the land tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for stup@@ idity than hitherto , it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and day @-@ to @-@ day struggle - this bit@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the election fighters , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on Us@@ edom , Rügen and Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the land tag . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate air bal@@ lo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count on votes in the end , can only be dealt with ar@@ du@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the El@@ ection and last holiday @-@ day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once again has to pass a campaign against the people over themselves . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , Leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly lag@@ ging behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; it will be exciting , how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition agreement . &quot;
&quot; S@@ ella , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous campaign , one can see from his grand@@ parents . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the land , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as it did his legendary word @-@ car@@ ger for@@ er@@ Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ions got cold feet and gives ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel the blame for the blos@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; We create that &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which now probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when one makes election campaigns at the wrong time at the wrong time . &quot;
she has twice been invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale talks ; Merkel Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ rot@@ kreis is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target audience did not vote , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other states , &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s a pity for anybody from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
&quot; apart from that , the North @-@ East CD@@ U has largely reno@@ unc@@ ed the usual election camp@@ uses on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbr@@ ellas and bal@@ lo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , so says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union has also noticed that in the country , it is the basis that it must be very strict , to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the expan@@ ses of the country there is hardly any available . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U election campaign Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; they have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely , where people are : Dor@@ fl@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because there is a lot in the game , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD into a particularly committed campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the social democr@@ ats last with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and only just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD had yet to win 35.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , the petty party with seven percent in the surveys , are likely to make the leap into the land @-@ day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ need and spend their campaign largely on the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; says the Chair@@ person of Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , green campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on searching for native voices among holiday@@ makers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ ats just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg Lake and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer under block@@ age
the speed with which the B 27 is rehab@@ ilit@@ ated there is nothing to compla@@ in about .
&quot; there are praise for those who are responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30@@ am in the morning and only end at 8@@ pm . &quot;
&quot; they did everything pretty z@@ ack@@ y , &quot; &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff of the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no de@@ duction .
&quot; at the beginning of the week , the construction site was moved to the south as scheduled , until the end of October everything should be finished . &quot;
&quot; the award is also presented for those responsible for building work , for instance when it comes to the furnishing of hous@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site has been moved on Monday to the south , and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ sheim has been lifted and the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is back again , the traffic situation inside the place has relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now drive from the B 27 from O@@ fter@@ sheim to the B 27 on both sides .
the exit traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; he says , responsible for the management of the Restru@@ c@@ turing Unit responsible for the Restru@@ c@@ turing Unit of Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the local residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many sne@@ ak trails were looking for and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sig@@ nage . &quot;
what led to some heavy trucks in residential areas .
&quot; as the speed limits were not met , the municipality demanded to intensi@@ fy the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there have been significant exceeding , &quot; says King , who made herself aware of the situation on the spot . &quot;
two to three per minute have been fl@@ ashed .
the fastest was on the road with 77 hours kilometres in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has moved on , it has become more quiet . &quot;
&quot; for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again . &quot;
business@@ men don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; however , that the B 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to revenue bro@@ o@@ ks , everyone you ask is to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the end customer , i.e. for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the deal@@ ership Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; at most slight drop &quot; , &quot; but also grants that &quot; &quot; course &quot; &quot; is missing . &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the locals along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential threatening .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it hard . &quot;
&quot; the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil . &quot;
we have to be happy about every euro sales .
&quot; at &quot; far over 50 percent , the sales revenue decl@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; street renovation has thrown back its operation &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot;
he has to release half of his staff .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismis@@ sed , politics would have responded differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , otherwise benef@@ iting from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other coun@@ ties , where more generous is handled . &quot;
&quot; with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , and refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regular guests can now look less frequently due to the complicated traffic guidance , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you cannot drive , it is also somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the fact that its trunk @-@ air comes back after the end of the refur@@ bish@@ ment work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts about it . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 building on his client@@ ele for the biggest crisis , which has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , that &apos;s brutal . &quot;
it is constantly being screw@@ ed up in the name of the fight against terrorism .
&quot; after the recent attacks , the Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère presents a thick security package . &quot;
but what does a dop@@ ing status have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is giving the servant .
&quot; all his proposals are &quot; politically reasonable &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Minister of the Interior in the introduction of his new security package . &quot;
they over@@ take no one .
&quot; other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
&quot; also , I took part in this . &quot;
&quot; however , as Minister of the Interior , he was lying on results and in a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère took a little while before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but they are all the more extensive .
&quot; a lot has already been announced , announced , announced , that a new security authority to take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU rules on passenger information and weapons law . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising as well .
&quot; in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second attempt for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck ji@@ hadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; says the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he still considers this to be reasonable and do not demand anything that has no chances in the coalition partner anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
some of them have in themselves : he plans quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for detention of people before deport@@ ation .
&quot; refugees who are targeted at the country , should previously check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security check . &quot;
&quot; in cases of ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than so far - such as comm@@ itting criminal off@@ ences or deliberately throw away their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of it is politically and legally sacred .
some also have an un@@ even effect and leaves questions open .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - raises the question : what actually does this have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; yes , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people worried about security in the face of high refugee numbers . &quot;
&quot; and things that people were deeply involved , let us not cling to election times even in election times . &quot;
the inner safety is enorm@@ ously placed in the focus .
&quot; only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; yes , there are competitions . &quot;
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly putting themselves in place on the issue of inner security .
&quot; in the past few days , there was a high level between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; only a sudden stri@@ fe about the equi@@ pping of the federal police , then a security @-@ political idea collection of some EU interior ministers , in which the councils also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al from the dual citizenship . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also ar@@ ks here for con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
&quot; from a turn away from the double @-@ pass , he is not holding anything . &quot;
we have talked about the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ open it is not useful .
and with a bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
&quot; if its own package is un@@ constitutional in all corners and whether it is indeed &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it must first be revealed . &quot;
there is a lot of potential for stri@@ fe .
but the SPD is currently trying to profile itself on the topic of inner security .
&quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel first sign@@ aled carefully and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which contributes to further increasing safety . &quot;
nor does Volkswagen get off lightly .
&quot; despite diesel engines , the delivery numbers are rising worldwide . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not run in all markets . &quot;
&quot; in the recall action , there is a ver@@ tex of a term . &quot;
Volkswagen eng@@ ages in deliveries to the second half of the year .
&quot; despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer has been able to offer further advantages in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ established markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the core brand of VW was mainly in Western Europe and thus loaded the total sales , as the company noted in Da@@ x . &quot;
&quot; worldwide , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
in the home market Germany the deliveries declined by almost a sixth .
&quot; chief Econom@@ ist Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann conducted the weaker figures from July , mainly on two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there has been a purchase restra@@ int in some core markets by &quot; changing economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , too , the British vote for exit from the EU stressed that a spokes@@ person explained . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust aff@@ aires escal@@ ated first , there is also a min@@ us too . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; overall , the primarily affected family @-@ brand of Lower Saxony is already lightly off lightly in the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition minus 0.9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , Group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler could still show a sales place . &quot;
&quot; in this period , 1.3 percent more cars were supplied in this era , around the world &apos;s 5,@@ 904 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated exhaust gas tests with a software .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million vehicles to retro@@ fit into workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW reiter@@ ated that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting , the car manufacturer put out a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was called on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
firm of the Year for White Coll@@ ar Crime Rede@@ ker Sell@@ ner D@@ ahs
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; reports , Volkswagen bore his German customers now a guarantee of fully equipped diesel models . &quot;
this was confirmed by VW @-@ representative in the Federal Office of Transport last Monday .
&quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
&quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my Insp@@ ection Commission and KBA fully . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; deviations from these are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power will not take place after retro@@ fitting and have remained unchanged for all type appro@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not as it was called in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; guarantee , &quot; Volkswagen is able to see the possibility that , for example , half a year after the conversion , customers can come to a workshop for example half a year - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage does not have anything to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that in any other damage , which has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal , a uncertainty as to possible guarantees shall come as it was called . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the future , Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands extensive savings in the future - as second institute in Germany . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , banking manager Josef Paul said : &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight or day money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Bundes@@ verband Deutscher Banken speaks of a single case and does not see a signal in it : ordinary austerity would not have to be feared , for its as@@ parag@@ us criminal tri@@ bun@@ als . &quot;
&quot; banks spend money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty . &quot;
&quot; this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of retail and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on gi@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros in the future , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; for some time he be@@ ware 40 million euros , which could be with@@ drawn from one day to another and which he could not utilize . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.@@ 4@@ percent cost , &quot; said the bank chief . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle , the costs are now passed on . &quot;
&quot; leaving cash in the v@@ aults of Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four accidents , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the bank &apos;s stand . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and differ@@ ing on other investment forms .
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative association Bayern declared : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course creates considerable costs for all banks . &quot;
&quot; to carry it alone , &quot; &quot; business @-@ economic dur@@ ably not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; with pen@@ alties for deposits of three million Euros , the Thuring@@ ian Volks@@ â and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with their skat@@ bank branch in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private clients to pay surface coverage for deposits , so the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele , which is somewhat la@@ vis@@ h by the fortune . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; if they pay for free money . &quot;
&quot; the G@@ mund founded in 1911 has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ tach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs are living in the region . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative union of Bavaria &quot; &quot; is currently not known any further banks that charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; said speaker Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Association of German B@@ anks and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks ( BV@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative towards the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the migration of investors to competition . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
destination Boards : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lon@@ ely men of middle aged children love plates .
&quot; before you come to the comment section to see him under the pseud@@ onym &quot; &quot; Non @-@ Alle@@ gri@@ a Men &apos;s Medi@@ ator &quot; &quot; with rough ins@@ ults , this statement deri@@ ves from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed re@@ formation of vinyl records is not due to a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid@@ life no@@ stal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a plate are all fores@@ ight at the age of 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most impro@@ b@@ able buyer group . &quot;
it is also not a horror caused by hob@@ bies - it has an emotional significance : older plate sellers keep their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but vote the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while I run in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and run wild , before I stick , hold my hands and say something determin@@ ant like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores . &quot;
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera off for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observing .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I am from Si@@ ster Ray ( data count : two young women , three men middle aged ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of files : eight men middle aged , a woman , presum@@ ably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess already , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets . &quot;
&quot; these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by email , I did not follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and re @-@ buy items he sold when he was young and pl@@ ung@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things that I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records , are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers whom he meets will meet You@@ Go@@ v &apos;s profile . &quot;
&quot; but he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are promp@@ ted to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually have got rid of their collection in the same way around 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs now to buy their records , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a specific age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a store like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offers a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers received an imp@@ etus to the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , from objects that call lucky youth memories . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of empt@@ iness or property of material poss@@ essions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it &apos;s the case with many people .
it is an easy way to deal mentally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; in@@ still@@ ed a staff of a pile of plates .
&quot; a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , have not yet listened to them . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
at that time of the news report I would probably look very worried while I was pu@@ zz@@ led by a stack of bos@@ sa nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of Points : three men of middle aged age ) has noticed a &quot; &quot; trophy &quot; &quot; of the revival . &quot;
&quot; someone came here only recently and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound@@ board so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
this is not a big percentage but it definitely happens .
&quot; more product @-@ friendly , less musi@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; they are younger people , not older ones , who only slowly come in . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a b@@ lower audience than I am going in . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle aged women . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest synthes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ be@@ et@@ ter pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks very lon@@ ely , but psychological trau@@ mas are hard to imagine if you stand next to someone 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of boards available for sale . &quot;
it is rather a shopping @-@ shopping @-@ shopping than a wholesale purchase .
&quot; it does not deserve much , therefore collecting records is not a real option , it says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way but the beauty of records is ... it drives off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I look at the jeans hot@@ pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ing around Polar@@ oid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are wondering to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a stair@@ well , a wall full of records by Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these objects means more money for the industry and some customers might send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to compla@@ in about . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , who has more time and money than others , is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as boards . &quot;
&quot; even if my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are right , at least in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record shops and online forums , leave them un@@ considered . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with st@@ rolling through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they avoid the star@@ ring look of an unc@@ anny , thirty @-@ year old false announc@@ er who raises nothing remin@@ ding middle @-@ aged men over the shoulders . &quot;

French court acqu@@ ires offer on demoli@@ tion of businesses in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial of this week the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary shops selling , selling hair@@ dressing services , or selling tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would include a fire and san@@ ity risk .
&quot; humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also led out that the Pro@@ visional Government and Restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 provisional businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the gro@@ c@@ eries , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely to feed people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the ra@@ inf@@ all was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &quot; Café of the camp , which is non @-@ profit @-@ driven and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; over 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to protect the Kids &quot; Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian it meant that &quot; &quot; closing &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated that the number of those who live in the jungle has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer . &quot;
despite Olympic dis@@ appointment : Martin remains batt@@ les@@ hip
&quot; despite his dis@@ appo@@ inting appearance at the Olympic time , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get lost . &quot;
&quot; I keep the World Cup at a glance , stay confident and fight , &quot; the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
he has no explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place in the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; to me it &apos;s hon@@ estly difficult to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot;
&quot; he had to analyse in peace , which causes the de@@ bac@@ le had led . &quot;
Martin actually wanted to compete for the title at the World Championship in Qatar in October in Qatar .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of speed meters : in different provinces , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the Temp@@ s are to be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the fut@@ uris@@ tically acting En@@ forcement trailer of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to sandy bridges with temporary Tem@@ pl@@ ine there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide there with a stationary speed heater for compliance with speed limits . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile design can be too dangerous or complex . &quot;
&quot; the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days in continuous measurement , the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be measured across multiple tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as driving b@@ ans after time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hit@@ ch according to manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; in order that it is not easy to sound , it is lowered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also sne@@ ak out outer shell disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ itz from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to data of Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also flash with the new technique : recently , France rec@@ eded 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
great Britain re@@ tains silver in the 7 @-@ year rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class reco@@ vers gold
&quot; Britain &apos;s impressive performance during the 7 @-@ year rug@@ by reached an ab@@ rupt halt in the final hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated at the De@@ od@@ oro stage here in Rio on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji distributed a master class in handling , side @-@ st@@ acking , finishing , liner and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was swe@@ pt through the not too bad sol@@ ace prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the sharp defeat of the strikes , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but irrespective of this , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in the form of this form . &quot;
&quot; it might be a comfort for UK , but it will probably not be that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind it .
&quot; eight years ago , they lost each game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under Ryan . &quot;
here they just lost one .
&quot; this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began mira@@ cul@@ ously and left the attacks of GB@@ s out of fun .
&quot; it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if one would run into driving buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was kno@@ cking over in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with only four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he converted . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB scar@@ cely touched the ball .
&quot; a h@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stops the mount of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute lete j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner a touch@@ down and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ union and there was still more than one minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still cores . &quot;
this is how it is .
GB conducted fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes what was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant mid @-@ play of Fi@@ ji .
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Atlantic , whose fans sang , sw@@ inging flags and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach to Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame set the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
&quot; the P@@ fi@@ ff rang , the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and GB kick@@ ed out in the law@@ ns . &quot;
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated in semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ final match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the strikes in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate under the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the prize - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer for rowing victory
there will be no more emotional gold than in these games and that &apos;s what you want .
&quot; from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve that enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those who sat on the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the response of the trainer Robin Williams was only present when she was promoted to the second Olympic champion in the second without a tax wife , the first women in the history of British sport , who put on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; her domin@@ ance was absolute , at least her 39.@@ 000 un@@ trained insert , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph@@ al effect . &quot;
behind each gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make up the incre@@ mental progress that make the difference and it was nobody lifting than the trainer who would not know if he was diagnosed with cancer this day at all .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t do that , it is spreading everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the break down to a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
that is how it begins .
rowing in itself is a challenge but that makes it even bigger .
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of the victory her first thoughts came to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ ra@@ ging morning doing something more than usual and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . that &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it only repe@@ ats how much that means , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach of the world . &quot;
I wouldn &apos;t have been able to wish for a better person for exercising or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning won &apos;t lose any race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much to reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not out of doing something great .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about its future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV adv@@ entur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that that was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to conc@@ eive that I am an Olympic Champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years exemplary for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , retired . &quot;
&quot; the association is considered &quot; &quot; exemplary &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water @-@ purpose ban@@ dage as a model for the large water producers .
&quot; so , some time ago , it was in the original on a contribution of the Bavarian Radio . &quot;
&quot; little later , the water forum of the Lower Francon@@ ia government appl@@ au@@ ded the association . &quot;
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group lived &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern far as exemplary &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the association of employees , was 28 years old as managing director . &quot;
he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group based in Kot@@ t@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150,000 cubic metres of water each year and supplies 32 resorts and pastures with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water suppliers for other towns and villages .
&quot; the current Chairman , Breit@@ brunn mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was employed as a water attend@@ ant in 1985 and was appointed General Manager of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work through office and organization activities , household planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions at weekends , &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; she named the inauguration and initi@@ ation of the new foun@@ tains ( 1994 ) , purchase of land in the New Fo@@ un@@ tain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , renov@@ ations of the high container ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the partial re @-@ renov@@ ations of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there has been no stand@@ still , and I have always added innovations because water lives and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in their lau@@ dation they praised the faithful , faithful and correct service for over 31 years . &quot;
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose ban@@ dage and has lived in rule the water @-@ purpose ban@@ dage as if it were his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , he was a real practitioner to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group to the formation of nit@@ rate in front of the water forum of the Lower Francon@@ ia . &quot;
for that he received a great deal of praise and praise .
&quot; in his turn , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water attend@@ ant and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a cli@@ ma@@ xes from his point of view , he called Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband . &quot;
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment were the rup@@ ture of pi@@ ping at the high tank near Kirch@@ der on 3 January .
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the localities could be supplied with water . &quot;
also the care of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained because one filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succe@@ eds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko is open to the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it .

&quot; when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed she had to die . &quot;
&quot; however , the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago arrived well forward and is now privately run in New York , where there are the best therap@@ ists . &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man sho@@ ots on partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot on Friday at 10.@@ 45 o &apos;clock in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n County ) and injured her deadly wounded .
&quot; the man himself called with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , after him I will be publicly tra@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. could be travelling by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a gl@@ at@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man is wearing a gl@@ at@@ ron . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he can still carry the weapon in himself , so the police . &quot;
those who see Sven S. will call the 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the responsible police in Lübeck initially did not want to provide any information about the decline or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but they confirmed that a human being had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a child of killing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more we don &apos;t say at this moment , &quot; said a police @-@ speaker in Lübeck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special operation squ@@ ad ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene . &quot;
steel - Flas@@ h@@ work for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ driven and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions .
financial bur@@ dens that the industry threatened by green electricity subsidies are from the table .
&quot; in the release of the Renew@@ able Energi@@ es lev@@ y in the German steel industry , Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday issue ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; accordingly , the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases coming from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry increased additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , there is now a fundamental agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel mills , they pay off an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent . &quot;
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission on self @-@ plan@@ ing .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the current regulation will be largely written . &quot;
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Steel is Future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others need to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; even in the reform of the emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are to be less@@ ened , &quot; IG Metall CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann explained in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has suffered under over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation continued to ag@@ grav@@ ate when the world &apos;s largest producer of producers drove crude steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has become somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , imposed customs duties on import steel have impact , on the other hand , economic prospects have risen in China . &quot;
uncle@@ ar how sustain@@ ably the price @-@ picking is .
the German branch of the branch of Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; finally , the prices would have stagn@@ ated . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp also did not want to exclude loose ends of individual works .
&quot; in the German steel industry , around 86@@ 0,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , such as the economic association steel on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the quantity produced now went back to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an increasing output of orders due to an improved order situation . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors well &quot;
&quot; singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in teacher &apos;s studies she occupied the subject music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall alive , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good about her health and her mind . &quot;
&quot; S@@ ingen is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German sen@@ iors division . &quot;
&quot; most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and cultivate social contacts . &quot;
&quot; often social and family structures dis@@ solve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be stren@@ uous in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
sen@@ iors training a deep and controlled breathing .
anyone who regularly demands his lungs will not get out of the pu@@ ff even in everyday life .
&quot; even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Group of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generation , common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening of songs in older people w@@ akes up a lot of memories , often associated with positive sen@@ tim@@ ents of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and especially melodies , dementia causes people to fall back on long @-@ lying episodes . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head also demands special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; to concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and rhythm at the same time , and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; even older people , who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition you hear through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I do something for a long time , I become better and a@@ wo@@ ke beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he thinks little talent reveals L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who is hearing when a sound goes along ? &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquaint@@ ances in a senior choir , one can easily join . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can directly contact the church or the church leader .
many sen@@ iors can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with internet research . &quot;
&quot; who wants to sing , should necessarily join a chor@@ us , av@@ eng@@ ed H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for all ages .
cats react sensi@@ tively than cr@@ aters on scre@@ ams of young animals
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover which effect the sleep of cat baby has on adult animals .
&quot; to their surprise the mi@@ sts also did not leave the males cold - however , they beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the reg@@ ression of cat bab@@ ys at the mi@@ ch@@ ew@@ ing of the little ones .
&quot; they respond by ten percent faster to lu@@ te of k@@ itt@@ ens , who are in great hard@@ ship , as scientists from the Veter@@ inary University and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) have found out . &quot;
&quot; k@@ aters also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - though , always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of significance , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
she is first @-@ author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous study , the research team already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens @-@ cri@@ es differs from the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight females were observed from the MH@@ H animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
they were performed for a call of little ones who were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bling .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with cri@@ es of more strongly arous@@ ed k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised additionally . &quot;
the researchers hold their results despite the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who had no offspring , re@@ acted differentiated at the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned faster to the loudspeaker when this calls of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played off .
this ability may possibly be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males ever responded , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have repeatedly studied the reactions of women and men to baby no@@ ises in humans . &quot;
&quot; some studies also showed that women were sensitive to babies , no matter if they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist told Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski grab@@ s with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the attempted put@@ sch , an important football match will be held in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; ahead of Du@@ el the Arch@@ du@@ als between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul round the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; the government , the daily life of normal vou@@ chers , was not to be affected by the suspension of the state of emergency after the attempted coup attempt in July . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempted put@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it does not stop before football . &quot;
&quot; against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ ür , the public prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the South Gate living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; South Gate shall be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the attempted put@@ sch by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an . &quot;
&quot; although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact this has no effect on the life of most Turks . &quot;
the no@@ c@@ turn@@ al &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; on public places throughout the country declared Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday for an end .
the sport is - like the whole country - split into tra@@ ilers and opponents of Erd@@ og@@ an .
especially fans of the workers &quot; clubs are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
&quot; but in view of dramatic experiences in history , the growth of the Turks is the strict rejection of military put@@ ts . &quot;
even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Col@@ tas .
&quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; it will especially arrive at Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; the Cologne based in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine designs in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top scor@@ er of his club . &quot;
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 victory .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the trophy for his team .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record champion found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the rounds @-@ out K.@@ O in the Champions League , the &quot; Li@@ ons &quot; f@@ arewell to the Europa League at an early stage . &quot;
&quot; in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g , it only reached rank 6 . &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed this and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Champion Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year of the game was better . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who , with 26 seasonal events , laid the basis for the 14th title as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ chi@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans hope for the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; in doing so , the I@@ AC Florence negoti@@ ated and on Bes@@ ik@@ tas only disclosed a bor@@ row@@ ed Gom@@ ez after the attempted put@@ sch , because of the political situation in the country after its European holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just needs to say it , &quot; said the specialist magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club@@ manager F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; to do this , the Stür@@ mer would have to be willing to reno@@ unce about a third of his estimated age of 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man pointed out : &quot; his salary in Florence can we not pay . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have still Med@@ als chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was closed twice because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa must not start in Rio .
other survi@@ ving athle@@ tics s@@ inner can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; the Russian float in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had compla@@ ined about a dop@@ ing lock just before playing , was fl@@ acci@@ lessly plu@@ cked out at her start ( 100 meters of breast ) . &quot;
&quot; it was a sc@@ ur@@ r@@ ile scenery : with a super@@ imposed smile , she was still in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance . &quot;
&quot; when it was established that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a j@@ umper @-@ storm . &quot;
but there are many more sports@@ men going to start the Olympic Games in Rio despite D@@ oping past .
here is an overview :
&quot; Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he has been locked for two times because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9,80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock after you have detected the intake of pain by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery I had strong to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion of 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 was positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl hex@@ ane . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied boarding and was closed for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great fav@@ ori@@ ess .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested positive and closed for 21 months in 2010 . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement have been responsible , em@@ bedding Mer@@ ritt . &quot;
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has more than 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man in the world . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete had so many medals were det@@ ectable afterwards . &quot;
thus T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after Test@@ osterone D@@ oping was established .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to give Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
&quot; the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games , which was also recognised , was rec@@ alled due to a verdi@@ ct of the CAS International Spor@@ ting Tribunal . &quot;
&quot; at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m , he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km Walk , China ) : the World Record and the J@@ ail@@ fav@@ ori@@ ine was tested positive only in May but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , references to the intake of a forbidden food supplement were found , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA was mil@@ der and ran already on July 13 . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austri@@ a@@ - wounded - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Department of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she suffered from cuts and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already been able to leave it . &quot;
she planned her home journey for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the other explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he also Austrian citizens are concerned , it is still uncle@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , such as Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; in the approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in had first explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ lig@@ in was killed and about 20 people were injured , among them the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning , two explo@@ sives went up again , and a further human being was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
&quot; during the det@@ on@@ ation near to the popular seaside resort of Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police information . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed an urban cler@@ k . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives arrived in the air in a flower set in front of the territory of the coastal police . &quot;
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he on the south @-@ east coast demanded several wounded . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings bear the same signature , &quot; &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot;
we assume that this is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to manifest itself to possible motives , but it is probably the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist rebellion or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta were laid . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities have received intelligence for im@@ min@@ ent attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact date and places . &quot;
still be uncle@@ ar what group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police told her officials all over the country , security related to important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are usually not against tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the bom@@ bing explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) applied for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ lu@@ a and Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after disputes between the security forces and the Muslim population , there will be no necessary travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applied for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were un@@ successful a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution adopted by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to cause chaos , while the country moves towards stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , re@@ tains the power to restore the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
&quot; nearly one year ago in Bangkok , a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine had been killed in Bangkok , most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack on the recent history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is in the sight of the Federal Office for Constitutional Com@@ pla@@ int .
&quot; after several state offices , the constitutional guards in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see in the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; indications of efforts against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; said Chancellor , Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß , the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants of Islamic belief or from the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist manner . &quot;
that is why we are now watching the movement .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; multic@@ ult@@ i @-@ del@@ usion &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a constitutional reserve in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; identi@@ ties . &quot; &quot;
he said that his authority was closely coordinated with the State Off@@ ices in the decision .
&quot; groups such as the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful tongue , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the daily Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an adverti@@ sed advertisement for your own cause .
the propaganda is meant to address the people emotion@@ ally .
young people are due in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; finally , there were reports of contacts of &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ aß said , I have no knowledge about that . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes its direction and becomes extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether these persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognis@@ able .
&quot; with a view to the marked increase in illegal crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ aß said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this regard . &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be right @-@ wing @-@ wing structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Free Valley group .
&quot; it may well be that further right @-@ wing group@@ ings or small groups form , plan the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a Germany @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of rectangular @-@ terrorism is not recognizable . &quot;
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; expressed concern , Ma@@ ate insi@@ sted that many attacks went on the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before . &quot;
that is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects on asylum seek@@ ers were previously not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or Left , who have then radic@@ alised themselves by right @-@ wing extre@@ mis@@ m . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always determine the Olympics or World Records the head@@ lines at the Olympics .
this shows the courage@@ ous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the easily over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia are so slow that it was no longer seen in the TV @-@ pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cli@@ pping was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently transformed into a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended up with a reg@@ ression of 48 seconds and occupied the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was not his straight sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming more well @-@ known in under@@ represented countries .
&quot; because most sports@@ men are running in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the round .
some media called it the &quot; ro@@ bel of the wh@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; &quot; prosperity b@@ auch &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; made it funny about him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter free style , played there no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
in the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i provided media attention .
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to stand alone in a pre @-@ run over 100 metres of fre@@ estyle . &quot;
fr@@ en@@ e@@ tically M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
&quot; at that time , 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim before the Olympics for eight months and never had such a long distance before the competition . &quot;

Tr@@ ump looks not as close to the dro@@ pping electoral defeat
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump appe@@ als to a campaign rally in Florida .
&quot; should it be anything with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump already has an alternative video . &quot;
he then goes on holiday .
&quot; losing Donald Tr@@ ump hon@@ ours the US presidential elections in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately it will either fold or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ can in a telephone interview with the US TV station CNB@@ C . &quot;
&quot; if it does not suff@@ ice for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be that in order , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he called President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist mili@@ tia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance formed . &quot;

GF@@ K leadership steps down after dis@@ appo@@ inting figures
the consumer research firm Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the feedback suddenly came - but not surprisingly .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will become even more in@@ secure , the longer the successes promised by him . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;

&quot; however , the fruits of restructuring are not to be seen even after 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will eventually become rest@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if that would be the case at BMW , that would make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; it was said . &quot;
&quot; following set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company could not stop its loss of losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at € 36@@ 1.2 million , revenue was 6.1 percent lower than the previous year &apos;s level . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the first half of the year , sales tot@@ alled 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros by 3.4 percent . &quot;
&quot; in view of its difficult economic situation , earnings in the second quarter were largely imp@@ acted by the company &apos;s uns@@ ur@@ passed value . &quot;
&quot; the company value depreci@@ ation of EUR 139 million , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience Business Unit , secured the Group under the line a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros . &quot;

accidents - Bus slides in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight Ver@@ injured
&quot; in an accident of a travel report with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the passengers suffered severe injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her information , had to ev@@ ade an opposite lap which partly drove on the opposite track . &quot;
the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; because of the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus automatically , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade liber@@ ated the passengers .
six rescue cars and a emergency ambul@@ ance arrived at the incident at Landes@@ straße 2 .
the undes@@ ired traveler were taken from a regular bus back to the Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the stress tester and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; the fees per cubic meter of wast@@ ewater are from 1 October 2016 for the area of sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Third leg 3.@@ 44 instead of till now 2.10 Euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 euros ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ ores 3,@@ 64 euros ( up to now 2.@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wast@@ ewater fee will be increased at the latest once corresponding improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after an over@@ lay calculation , the sewage @-@ price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , during the approval of the budget by the Federal Council of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , there were under@@ coverings for these sewage systems . &quot;
&quot; due to legal grounds , the Cas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the facilities cost @-@ effectively . &quot;
&quot; from 1 October 2016 onwards , citizens and industrial companies from World Bank , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the fee increases lie between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Director of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt displayed the Board , a new calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary . &quot;
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 over@@ - or under@@ coverings from the previous calculations period will be compens@@ ated .
&quot; the engraving increases are based on the fact that there are relatively small facilities in all three se@@ wer systems with a very low waste water attack , which lies between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; for example , due to the low distribution basis , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low distribution basis . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the sewage system in all three systems is slightly retro@@ grade . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , due to their age of refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expenses , the lap@@ id@@ ating period of calculations did not last considerably due to their age of refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expenses . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the facilities for World Choir , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth and Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years old . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the sewage plant in Az@@ endorf because of a damage .
&quot; in the Pump@@ werk World Bank , the nearly 20 years of old conveying systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and at the pond treatment plant Lop@@ p had to be extended after nearly 20 years , the sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to keep the water @-@ legal requirements in future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the continued care and maintenance costs , which have to be taken into account in the new calculation period , came into consideration . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were significantly below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
&quot; stone houses made it clear that in the low waste water attack in the three systems , expenses for operation and maintenance were completely broken . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the market town of great entertainment costs for wast@@ ewater facilities in the past 20 years has been spar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Stein@@ häuser , the situation for the above @-@ mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious as one could not expand the supply area of the sewage purpose association Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal , because it is concerned with defici@@ ent facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria beats for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first one over zero since October last year was charged as a positive 0.2 % .
the average annual average of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1,7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell on clothing and foot@@ wear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in the mon@@ day with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect is critici@@ zed as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
&quot; Snap@@ chat states that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its Filter@@ tool , it allows Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure , which could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are inde@@ struc@@ tible , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that generate more than 30 million new sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all wrong entries are directed to the public .
&quot; in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were accused that the app would promote Black@@ face condu@@ ci@@ ve or white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them s@@ lot@@ ting , false teeth and grown che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature from Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot; &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if these repeated contro@@ versy had been indic@@ ative of a larger problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and indign@@ ation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it had de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the company offered an excuse : the filter was designed as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who experienced rac@@ ism , the filter reminded of hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et was widely spread across the photos , was that the filter was &quot; hur@@ ting and bar@@ k said uncomfortable . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradic@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yellow face has been pulled into the throwing extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses these cultural stum@@ bling wires .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the appliances we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are different from breed di@@ vers@@ er than their older counter@@ parts - might be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ chat &apos;s filters creates a picture that is offensive for a user , &quot; so it &apos;s much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed than it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and others decided to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay on media and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that rac@@ ist controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the attitudes practices of Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu also critici@@ zed the big part of white , only male leadership and ended their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what to do about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely un@@ answered the Snap@@ chat . &quot;
the company does not publish figures for the diversity of its staff and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , the Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a personnel responsible focusing on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu said in their turn that they will leave their Snap@@ chat account closed and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more user than us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military Gover@@ ning IS@@ IS Intelligence Information , establishes Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to portra@@ y an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as the actual conditions were allowed on site , an inquiry committee of the congress declared in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can Members of the Republi@@ can Guard , Intelligence Committee and the Defense Minister , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state . &quot;
&quot; central Command , just cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence @-@ based information , typically fed off by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly drawn a more positive picture of US efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on site , and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; noted Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the guide faults in Cent@@ com reach up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows in detail consistent issues in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there are no direct references to the fact that government tips under Obama gave instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts were exposed to the pressure from their superi@@ ors , a more optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements prior to Congress were much more positive than the facts presented . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ com candidate publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mozambique can begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ sul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command &apos;s tips changed the intelligence reports to play down the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after it was played that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed knowledge while the investigation continues .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com reports are underway through the Secretary @-@ General of the Ministry of Defense . &quot;
the democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can task force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly limited process for the preparation of intelligence services to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; the highest ranking Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; damaged the mor@@ als under analysts and &quot; gave moder@@ ately little space for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats did not give evidence of a White House intervention at Cent@@ Com analysts with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon General In@@ spec@@ tor , following complaints from Cent@@ com analysts . &quot;
&quot; Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on any reports of the Congress while the general inspec@@ tors were still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also indicated that &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have further effects on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; the accus@@ ations last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of feu@@ ds of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , had looked at the recommendations of many analysts only a small crew of occupation in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic state .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker insi@@ sted that , contrary to the statements of the government , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger , commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the Legisl@@ ative for his excessive positive app@@ rais@@ al of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the United States wins a fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with the UK . &quot;
&quot; one day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in mind .
&quot; however , she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ on in the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain un@@ defeated . &quot;
the United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will reach the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first place @-@ placed will take a little longer from the path that will lead the other group .
&quot; whatever the game is on Saturday , the Americans have spar@@ ked a surprising hur@@ ri@@ cane by their success story , four years after they ended up in the last of 12 squares at the last London Games . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey beat in hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years ago she became National player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re . &quot;
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an English , coach of the National Team , became a better turning point . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the working group in London that we now have .
we have been able to s@@ nat@@ ch the ru@@ d@@ der completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the go@@ at@@ tire in the first half of the game with a bac@@ kl@@ ash out of the close @-@ up area .
&quot; India was going into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she executed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and then kno@@ cked the ball into the gate to give the female a 2 @-@ 0 guided tour . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the US door@@ keeper , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next match on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ines &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , as late as it is also , there are the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; Rio de Janeiro events feel consistent and ines@@ capable , a rapid unc@@ eas@@ el between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
it is as if the olymp@@ ic torch is itself a burning rod that is served by the w@@ rist@@ band to the swi@@ mmer to the tur@@ ner for tri@@ athletes .
&quot; you can &apos;t turn off the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with dimples , could have been under these familiar names that would have been sent to Prime Time , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , tur@@ ner , or even f@@ enc@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic Tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
the Olympic flame doesn &apos;t illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; sports that are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ols , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may there be long .
&quot; but if I should rather make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had been their debut in Sydney , the last 16 years have been so anno@@ yed that many of them , I had asked , did not know that it is actually an Olympic sport . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the US sent athletes for competition , it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had a ath@@ lete until 2012 , who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for both the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ age char@@ me , partly because it fits for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear suitable for a c@@ low@@ ns school than that for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ or@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ious trem@@ bling of his never ending impact , but also the grace of exercising and diving , the two sports that essentially un@@ ites it . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; jumping board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; you will be evaluated according to the official Olympic program according to version , level of difficulty and flight time . &quot;
&quot; athletes of 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the common olymp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts in her quest for gold go on , faster , up and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and back , up and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they hunt not only the finish line or the output wall , but also another highlight in the television transmission : the world or the Olympic ch@@ ords . &quot;
&quot; the targeted quest is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it &apos;s also what I think of when watching these games as something ti@@ ring .
&quot; of this , the trampoline offers a breathing spell . &quot;
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she bo@@ unces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly upward again . &quot;
&quot; there is a competition , of course , not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no tac@@ tical attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , but the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics .
&quot; the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final round as part of a follow @-@ up block on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; when the increase in consciousness can be achieved only through the fear and the objective of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner proposed recently - according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his air to rin@@ se , new fans . &quot;
&quot; one Generation Prot@@ ects &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia cause violent opposition to the government .
witnesses say that zig prot@@ esters during the colli@@ sions with the police were killed by fire@@ arms .
is Ethiopia just collap@@ sing ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and spread to more and more areas . &quot;
&quot; last week , thousands of people rus@@ hed into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot;
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful . &quot;
witnesses indicate that polic@@ emen were shot on dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed .
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security men beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Security Council for Human Rights now demands an in @-@ depth investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the Horn of Africa &apos;s project leader , a research group . &quot;
&quot; in Nigeria , Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West . &quot;
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorists beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western aid . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but an example for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or in prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but this could change .
&quot; when you supp@@ ress people and these have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a professor in central Ethiopia . &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use up to stran@@ gl@@ ehold in relation to the power of the governing coalition .
&quot; following a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea increase ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , disp@@ uted line demanded hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo Liberation Front , or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which have been forced by more or less in recent years , could use the tur@@ mo@@ il and arm themselves again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess continue to explo@@ de under the surface after years of reco@@ il from the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; in recent years , many Ethiopia have been able to communicate with the social media , since cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the Internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians announced that they were so protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from orthop@@ e@@ dic@@ s predominantly to Christian high @-@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this too does not change .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the greatest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for approximately 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , had until his death in an un@@ published illness in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to process enemies and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively unknown reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after prot@@ esting thousands against elections , apparently ple@@ dged by the government and subsequently stolen by the government . &quot;
&quot; during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed even if there were less than in the past months and this time of distur@@ ban@@ ces passed relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts lob@@ bi@@ ed Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in comb@@ ating poverty . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ gi@@ vings of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ous city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights across the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally collap@@ sing in an already volati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin line of terror . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his statement Obama founded IS@@ IS &apos; sar@@ cas@@ m &apos;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempted to disp@@ el the last contro@@ versy surrounding his campaign by att@@ acking that his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication threw up new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ sible with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings his fellow @-@ comrades , who try to take care of him during an event@@ ful period , to explain in the peculiar position , statements which he could not have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; having made the hint at an election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump sum@@ mon@@ ed back to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to suggest that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created IS@@ IS . &quot;
but in an early twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was sar@@ c@@ astic .
&quot; the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day , on which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the ap@@ ology completely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump might help weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can candidate would not want to know about it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism falls down on Mr. Tr@@ ump as he tries to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign due to falling demand values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump attempted to return to this subject again .
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he drew a strong criticism , when he thought that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clin@@ tons of emails , but later he explained &quot; &quot; Of course I said that sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one linguistic boundaries in politics and then rec@@ u@@ per@@ ate as needed .
&quot; I think it is one of his ways to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then if necessary &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who watches the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an et@@ ched tone as his inquiries continued to decline . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist published on Friday showed a leading edge in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general tries not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dism@@ iss his statements or mis@@ understand his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while he is stepping up in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps shar@@ mon@@ ed his loyal companions in the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements might be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York , and one of the most prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , had great difficulty in defending the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani to the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ umps asser@@ tions , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ war@@ ders , completely wrong and that &apos;s why it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream Rep@@ ublic@@ ans attempt to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs , allowed IS@@ IS to spread itself aggres@@ sively under control of the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of carrying around on each of his words and being taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor , cham@@ ber@@ ed &quot; TV professionals trying to understand him and said , &quot; They can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ umps excuse rather than one further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once compla@@ ining about the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point returns &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a cheap coffee shop in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash which no Wi @-@ Fi had , but served for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were displac@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; So@@ ap Cher@@ ie business , which was sold in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
local people affected it as a final loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still cannot believe that CB@@ GB dead , the Chelsea Hotel is except and Ver@@ b is a soap business now . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is change , it is also re @-@ invention . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafe , the owner and managing director of the new cafe . &quot;
he began working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered to provide funds for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same Distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are t@@ opp@@ ings like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
&quot; the café no longer serves beer , but there are fresh ju@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also driven by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had been closed , she gave up the coffee break for a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it became clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the verb she liked , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of their usual iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition . &quot;
&quot; since the start of the verb in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal was another long @-@ standing and loyal customer . &quot;
he went there before the work and inevitably kept the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he sometimes changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he didn &apos;t have a gru@@ dge about that the soap business took the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee shop as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go on to her offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he pret@@ ended to leave them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice local wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands to an adjacent building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is sufficient to get their old favourites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was devast@@ ated when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the entrance of the restaurant and the ordering of a new coff@@ ees felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plenti@@ ful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as a g@@ our@@ mets President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for refined delicacies on Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Water@@ tur@@ tle soup .
&quot; his menu on that day was slightly more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane D@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; There was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; CO@@ Es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA while brick was told in her book &quot; &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; her latest co @-@ operation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Publishing , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a repor@@ ter in Eisen@@ berg &apos;s sandwich shop , a small , schn@@ ör@@ k@@ ell@@ os@@ em I@@ mb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a freshwater sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate . &quot;
&quot; when the repor@@ ter cooked pork meat , it found the pair suitable for discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , g@@ inger@@ bread and p@@ opp@@ y bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that sp@@ ends the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ anu@@ ts that they serve them as dinner .
code gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; it has to be placed in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cook for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; draws the roads with which the country moved with it no longer to be the land of land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; Co@@ e beg@@ ged why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget was equally ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as lo@@ aves and asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ producing food resi@@ dues &quot; , &quot; noted Zi@@ egel@@ man , as coo@@ ks were able to hide un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rarely ser@@ rated luxury . &quot;
&quot; strange mixtures were tried , because a cal@@ orie rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction rang in flavor or even healthy kitchen . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book , which includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from that era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition at mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
&quot; like never before or ever since , the budget econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - enjoyed the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot;
&quot; having published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household workers &quot; and the challenge of turning P@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historic treats .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ E@@ ating attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant house kitchen of his kitchen , he sp@@ fed as the milli@@ on@@ aire man of the world to which he became . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental dishes like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and wore a Smo@@ king .
he was a stranger to reality .
&quot; President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to cast an example with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the how@@ ling of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors caused by Mrs Roos@@ ev@@ elt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country returned to its legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , Bri@@ ck@@ man said , as well as on how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; in writing the book , the couple gave better understanding of the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw away food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of food wa@@ sting , &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered , &quot; They actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the sei@@ z@@ ure of wind .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e dra@@ gged out a dessert made at home : the pl@@ um dessert , the President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a usual trick , modest recipes to miss a chic name . &quot;
&quot; there were no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone di@@ ved something rel@@ uc@@ t@@ antly a spo@@ on in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; amaz@@ ingly , it did not ta@@ sted badly . &quot;
Co@@ E won three times a night .

he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
&quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died in a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a group of civilians who saved the lives of nearly 60,000 people according to Bild @-@ Zeitung . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the area of war .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil servant , which shows him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a baby from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syri@@ ans a lumin@@ ous symbolic figure in the horror of war .
&quot; but as a hero , he never saw himself , said according to the picture : &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I die , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have thrown four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from difficulty . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb so that not children play with it , &quot; the picture c@@ ites his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks usually come only in winter to the surface .
&quot; after an examination , this Ha@@ i was allowed to return to the sea after an examination . &quot;
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with well a 1 km / h through North Atlantic - to the present day .
Greenland ha@@ y only comes with 150 years of offspring .
&quot; the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes average just 1,@@ 220 meters . &quot;
&quot; only when it matters , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a rich 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , characterized by slow@@ ness , seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k , which could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein comments from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist pre@@ fers that Greenland ha@@ ie become st@@ ony . &quot;
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks are difficult to observe , after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spitz@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland ha@@ y .
&quot; their time @-@ pent@@ ag@@ ons are called them , when they equi@@ p six animals with a transmitter before S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; prey make this shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
possibly they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the polar sea and look for cad@@ aver that tor@@ ches from higher water layers down@@ wards .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the biggest 502 centimet@@ ers measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucle@@ us of the shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
&quot; their birth , therefore , should lie after the early 1960s , as atomic weapons testing large amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers length , on the other hand , the lens nucle@@ us contained a low excess of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday during his investigation in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all larger Greenland @-@ ha@@ y , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in its len@@ tic@@ ular nucle@@ us , which arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timeter long Greenland showed an age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k with 502 centimet@@ ers might even be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only get offspring , if they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers were able to assign an age to the length . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold to sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication obviously leaves at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
this is likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live above all in icy waters is no coinci@@ dence .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 year old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , whose bac@@ on at the neck reached a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon tip , was caught before Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often also runs on a spar@@ ing flame . &quot;
so they mature then - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often very big . &quot;
the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; a very big animal should , on the other hand , invest its resources in a long life . &quot;
building plot in a double pack
&quot; with themes relating to construction , the Municipal Council in the recent meeting focuses on the focus . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the Board adopted the announcement by Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; finally , the marketing of recently proven dwelling areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after clari@@ fication of the plot , par@@ c@@ els and surveys and the applications for survey have been clari@@ fied , the sale of land in residential areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( section 1 ) to interested parties is nothing more in the way . &quot;
the municipal council is convinced that the bro@@ o@@ ks in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau address young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors in equal measure .
&quot; as it was said , Bau@@ wil@@ ten can immediately announce themselves to the town hall , on the allocation of plots , the municipal council is expected to consult in its September meeting . &quot;
&quot; in order to also en@@ qu@@ ire inquiries concerning the reloc@@ ation of other commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the Unter@@ time@@ expose area , the commercial park has been extended by two par@@ c@@ els in the direction of state road 21@@ 12 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; thus , the city on the Main has the best chances to attract jobs and companies from London in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt is most benef@@ iting from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Department of Expertise for Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money homes can continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have so far enough approval in the UK . &quot;
this is why large US banks are taking advantage of this .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
the Frankfurt Main Finance lob@@ b@@ ying association counts with 10000 new jobs in the Main within five years .
&quot; for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which un@@ ites the responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight over the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk management ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; although Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry , it also crashes as much as Dublin in the infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
&quot; in addition , the city offers easy @-@ to @-@ use commercial real estate . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it &apos;s not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate cars are 50 percent higher than on the River Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crimin@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city stands at number 7 , Luxembourg at number 19 , Dublin in square 33 and Paris at 37@@ th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; concluded the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but London will remain the most important financial center in Europe despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , my econom@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in late 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt , were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
an American pres@@ enter decided that Gilead Sciences Inc claim to reimbur@@ se the legal costs that you have ar@@ isen from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents filed by Mer@@ ck , which was associated with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and har@@ of@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge revealed a pattern of false behavior on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the per@@ sever@@ ance and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; when surve@@ ying the suit on Thursday , U.S. counter@@ leader Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to reimbur@@ se the costs incurred during the defence of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to equi@@ p with Gilead , which domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications , which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck su@@ ed each other and claimed ownership of laboratory works , including sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the United States say that they have reg@@ a@@ ined complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; the US supported troops reg@@ a@@ ined complete control over the northern town of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters left it in the city , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are passing through the town after the removal of the remaining group of fighters , who have buried themselves within the city . &quot;
&quot; they have freed more than 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stage by the fighters , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish shared the Military Council of Reu@@ ters with the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we just carry out clean @-@ up work , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Clin@@ tons deserve 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34.@@ 2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton published its tax declaration for 2015 on Friday , this revealed for the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former Secretary of State Bill Clinton earned a revenue of USD 3 million from the Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book about her office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax statements of the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hi@@ des behind false exc@@ uses and withdrawal regarding his previous promises his tax statements . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements , although they are not obliged by law to do so . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax audit as reason for his refusal to control the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidates of the democr@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ umps Special Ad@@ visor , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax inspec@@ tions were not completed . &quot;
&quot; the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney has already heard that his refusal questions pertaining to assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business and various other associations , particularly with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already pl@@ ung@@ ed to the subject and published a video on the internet on Friday to publish a high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump to publish his tax return .
&quot; on Thursday , she spoke about the topic during a speech on the economy in Michigan . &quot;
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax statements . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and a New York Times journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday stating that this could still be the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become a subject in election campaigns .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would make sure people pay more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election rally for H@@ illary Clinton in O@@ ma@@ ha last week , Neb@@ ras@@ ka asked Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away developed industry con@@ glomer@@ ate here , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax statements . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said he had also been subjected to a control of IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump have &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; in front of voters and not from tax authorities . &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign has published tax return to 2007 .
&quot; Clin@@ tons , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid on average an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s tax returns from 2015 showed that they were only USD 100 of their income as wage , unlike most Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues were tax@@ ed from USD 10@@ 9,000 . &quot;

&quot; con@@ doms with chil@@ i powder , fire@@ works support Tanz@@ ani@@ as Ele@@ ph@@ ant protection &quot;
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements in humans - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ es .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the honey@@ guide Foundation , which had already made the idea for years , along with the U.S. Nature Conservation has intensi@@ fied its promotion by using volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals . &quot;
&quot; previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is World Dog Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , being much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without dam@@ aging the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Honey@@ well Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the bub@@ bles in a horn .
&quot; if he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; chil@@ i cloud &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; chil@@ li@@ pu@@ ff mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ works in a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ yed fine dust on ch@@ ili@@ es into the air . &quot;
a touch quite usually already out to ch@@ ase the elephant .
&quot; one last possibility is a ver@@ ge , which sho@@ ots a golf fire@@ works into the air and causes a loud , light explosion . &quot;
municipal counc@@ il@@ or unanim@@ ously decides : no Ki@@ os@@ ens@@ ub@@ au at the St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er investment projects involve trade @-@ makers with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and - especially in the retail sector in the core city as much expand@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the municipal council , however , refused to apply for the construction of a sales ski@@ pper on the Rhine river in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine bal@@ con . &quot;
&quot; as a matter of principle , we welcome new tra@@ des@@ men but at this location in exposed position on the banks of the Rhine do not fit this ki@@ osk , &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U Group . &quot;
&quot; Jewish director breaks Berlin hotel , because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; call - RT News &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after he revealed that the Kemp@@ inski Brist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin had not listed Israeli pre @-@ election as it would have requested Arabic guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left the Kemp@@ inski Brist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last visit , Lanz@@ mann attempted to find Israel on the list of country selection . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and er@@ ased ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Brist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director looked at the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; shock@@ ed him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
the reason behind it was even more fur@@ ious in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is cancelled , &quot; the Prime Minister of Lanz@@ mann was cited . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this has been applied in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; drawing the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a rather big response on the internet , in which people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal . &quot;
some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel to recre@@ ate the alleged aff@@ or@@ estation of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed &quot; , &quot; it was said in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located in the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all alleg@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct instruction , &quot; &quot; Israel did not enter the quick dial @-@ list &quot; , &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
adds that the country code has been added .
police susp@@ ends tear gas &amp; rubber floor against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo , students met with the police on Thursday when they assembled to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system . &quot;
the police replaced tear gas and rubber floor against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to explore the students , which led to the police of rubber floor and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
&quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of the State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the protest participants were seen gra@@ ff@@ iti against the temporary President Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the latest protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went into the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been dismis@@ sed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an , the trade turnover between Moscow and T@@ ehr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the course of the year . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian companies has risen strongly to businesses in the country , the ambassador said . &quot;
Russian enterprises take up existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to access the market .
&quot; of course , the further trade extension is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ary@@ an . &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign representation made around 3@@ 5,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record figures of Iranian tourists in Russia last year are broken , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russians attend to Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
wanted : drinks market in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack on Thursday evening had been exer@@ ted on the drinks market of Re@@ we XXL on the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the co@@ hes@@ ion of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people , who had hoo@@ ded their faces , had the issu@@ ance of cash and then fled at first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money has been captured , the police do not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators should have been between 1,60 and 1.70 meters in size , thus relatively small . &quot;
the drinks market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is not fores@@ e@@ eable .
&quot; after the fall in the direction Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg , the perpet@@ rators must face the gravel parking space with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( sleeping ring ) . &quot;
anyone who has made observations at the time ( at 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) that are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y should urgently advise the police .
Nag@@ old : play and fun during daylight hours
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social peda@@ gog@@ ical daily group / social group work of the children &apos;s protection bun@@ ny Nag@@ old , with their assist@@ ants on their summer vac@@ ations in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
the life @-@ joyful group was quartered in the quiet Leisure Show in Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle during the first school holiday week .
several full @-@ day trips were on the program .
&quot; on the one hand , there were boards with the visit of the match @-@ z@@ oos . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , to &quot; &quot; Maul@@ bron@@ n &quot; , &quot; where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip took us to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; during the hot days the group rejo@@ iced at the Tiefen@@ see in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and pl@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; children and car@@ ers with their self @-@ made body@@ ies , such as Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ur@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were spoiled . &quot;
&quot; in workshops it was made possible to create beautiful pieces of jewellery made of pearls and stones , or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; further highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te Abend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of departure , the sun and the children and young people returned home satisfied . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Door of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on their way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were dealt with . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next round trip of all ministers in two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ rant Tour St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a several @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; several pilgrimage destinations have been examined and finally decided for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where in this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the opened gate of mercy on the Freiburg Mu@@ en@@ ster , a special pilgrimage destination was offered . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Hei@@ ligen@@ zimmern were on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , past@@ ors sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ m &apos;s crosses and par@@ ted the pilgrimage route . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b it was taken by train to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster @-@ Our Lady stands and so the Pil@@ gri@@ mage was taken from the Mu@@ en@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening , accompanied by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is on cross @-@ crosses , chap@@ els or churches always went back to sing a song from a specially assembled pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes were available . &quot;
&quot; at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller cared for a tasty , also strengthening dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day we continued via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; after that , one stepped on stage to St. Peter , which was the most stren@@ uous stretch of road , at first we had to climb about 500 metres in altitude and then climbed again . &quot;
the deser@@ ved reward was a common barbecue at the lake in the evening .
after the morning pulse on the fourth pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter it went to the final stage to Freiburg .
&quot; visi@@ bly facilit@@ ated and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg cathedral later in the afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy . &quot;
with a little impulse here God was given thanks .
the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert were welcomed at the evening mass in Münster .
&quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the district of B@@ reis@@ gau .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were characterised . &quot;
&quot; Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home , when Br@@ ite won Gold for cycling &quot;
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men team spr@@ int in the vel@@ o@@ drome in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor role , which his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself E@@ igen . the young boy made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from the favorites New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; England claimed a shock@@ ing victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y claimed the fifth of six Olympic medals . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick after being in March at the World Championships in London , despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys , only a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie &apos;s staff .
they did this in time as a one .
Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement created a gap which K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they remained as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y prev@@ ailed - and Sk@@ inner placed an Olympic board in the Quali@@ fication Round , but in the standard rounds the New Zealand won in the first lap . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ der fell short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
a change of strategy made a large part of the transformation in which Hin@@ der drove in a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell down Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der , when they stepped onto the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
in the final round we set up an olymp@@ ic board and defeated the world champ@@ ions .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 on the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys page , there was evidence that after a weak start he inten@@ tionally dropped off the train . &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such a problem .
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; it feels like London &apos;s entire UK flags at the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
we have come together as a team for the past three months .
we have been so badly away with so many world titles that it was incredible to win at the Olympi@@ ad .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London . &quot;
&quot; if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the vel@@ o@@ drome . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ ys , it is in the realm of the possible that he repeated Ho@@ y &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who is exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the Sprint that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a bit lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should become a k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal race of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four o@@ dom@@ eter races . &quot;
they came to the finish in 3 : 5@@ 1,9@@ 42 . &quot;
&quot; the World Record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins are focusing on safety .
&quot; he had argued yesterday with commission@@ ers before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women competition , which will be continued tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in World Records in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team is rel@@ ying on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a pair of medals .
&quot; after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; it played drama in the background , so the res@@ ign@@ ation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the middle of S@@ exis@@ iting and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ wür@@ fen as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks like that the now legendary GB@@ s , who has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again . &quot;
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy contract question@@ able
&quot; the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria , as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers , are at stake , as the system operator announces the energy supply contract and thus will lift all supply contracts , such as the supplying energy company . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 work@@ stations in the Al@@ coa facility in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 work@@ stations - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melting shop consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry melting shop , which last year led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant . &quot;
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , initially as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting shop with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , whereby the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller portions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means another physical demand for electricity by the melting shop , &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts should be so @-@ called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force in November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; hence , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the fiscal year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impact on the income on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
&quot; AG@@ L said that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual revenue of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; expectation of a termination &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to negotiate the contracts , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt , or to ensure the electricity supply to the melt &quot; is not affected . &quot;
&quot; the US company said that 2010 signed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which would have entered into force from November this year even if there is still one explanation of why it has res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn of the industry &apos;s poor economic conditions prior to the possible closure of the Port@@ land melting shop in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land had some 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and a total of around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year . &quot;
&quot; should both systems disappear from the market , that would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner Clan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der , and ran at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight brought me to cry , &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , saved reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner family ( except for the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as they forget the cover of their sister and that ends with a classical turn : they all have a surprise party planned . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ é@@ ed action almost every birthday sep@@ is@@ ode of a children &apos;s program ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to leave her other girls somehow on this Public@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September edition of Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans started with certainty . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes to see what the vo@@ gue cover is concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September issue is the most widely sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference , which rather resembles an illustrated book as a fashion magazine , the issue pul@@ ls a large number of advertisers ( According to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista used by the 8@@ 32 pages of the developer 6@@ 15 pages advertisement ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover stars is so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years images of the magazine reviewed yet before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , model@@ n &quot; as &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar @-@ Prize W@@ inner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour . &quot;
but even with the low chance that Mrs. J@@ enner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or te@@ ens of today who know how to shoot a good snap@@ chat video ( even if it applies to all of them ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers like success not everyone . &quot;
&quot; with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called them &quot; the bu@@ stle of the moment . &quot;
these feelings bo@@ iled up again when the message came out with the appearance of Y@@ enn@@ ers on the vo@@ gue cover .
but moving around on the mis@@ m@@ ess seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September edition of Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she works for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters will sell you pictures of yourself on their pay@@ wall apps .
she sold her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is shown in Reality TV . presum@@ ably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; municipal law centres annually exhibit 16@@ 0,000 people per year &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s aid figures are aver@@ ted annually by the municipal council centres , while the industry is taking on the effects of further mean cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , need@@ y workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ances and the like - have been rejected at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already exc@@ essi@@ vely busy , are prepared for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
the director of the municipality of Que@@ pos James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey conducted by the National Association of Public Relations centres revealed that thousands of people were rejected every year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only get worse without repe@@ ating the decision of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s municipal law centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and crus@@ hing debts , families who have been dismis@@ sed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been wron@@ g@@ ly dismis@@ sed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; as of June 2017 , the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of people in need from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the Secretary @-@ General and Federal Minister of Justice as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government filled its commitment to raise funds for legal hel@@ pers on the national average . &quot;
it is now time to look at the needs of the council centres and their customer communities and that the government Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump El@@ ection Campaig@@ n accused of having served as a weapon
new York : Donald Tr@@ umps campaign has been accused of alleged im@@ pover@@ ishment since it was told that its campaign manager for North Carolina had a fire@@ arm directed to a staff while traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was filed on Wednesday in the Regional Court of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software program@@ mer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; Bord@@ ini had to have been waiting for months for the matter to be settled internally , before realis@@ ing that &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign manager , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; pulled a gun , put his right finger on the trigger and r@@ ammed the barrel in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; gave Bord@@ ini in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; after having compla@@ ined of local and regional campaign management , Bord@@ ini noted that at least four more people had made the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he was charged with the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; gave Bord@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate dissolved a rebellion , he said that the &quot; Second Am@@ end@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arms and weapons fans - should take measures if his ri@@ val@@ in H@@ illary Clinton should be elected and judge judges . &quot;
&quot; it was clear that the media had swe@@ pt away his words from the context , and that he would not ag@@ grav@@ ate violence . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of due di@@ ligence duty , and by Philip for bodily harm and lasting psychological damage . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;

&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , announces that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : pol@@ l in front of federal elections : losing SPD and CD@@ U
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses are notable for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U . &quot;
these were representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the Bild &quot; Bild &quot; Zeitung ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could not go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the surveys in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD was the strongest party and would have good chances to continue the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD pl@@ ung@@ ed from 35.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent a five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party was just close to the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s parliament . &quot;
&quot; in spite of light losses , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ it@@ ated with 6 percent ( formerly 8.7 percent ) back into the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented by 3 per cent in the country tag .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; in doing so , they are still looking behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17,@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , Af@@ D would be represented in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties for the first time . &quot;
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return that the pir@@ ates would , in contrast to 2011 , miss the move . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market . &quot;
the followers today dominate the world - his maker experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , so it was not well in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather kno@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would today range for approximately two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now shipped with a minimum of 16 gig@@ ab@@ ytes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came to the stores exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few Euro fans can buy the devices still on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as an &quot; office in the west pocket format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , even by fax the communic@@ ator could be reached . &quot;
&quot; even access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , al@@ beit slow . &quot;
&quot; a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be worked like a laptop . &quot;
then they found a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
&quot; the price was rather proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. approx . 1400 euro . &quot;
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no @-@ one could susp@@ ect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
&quot; smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the mobile phone saver of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft . &quot;
today the market domin@@ ates vendors who came all much later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is everyday for many people today . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users around the world . &quot;
&quot; some 1.4 billion devices , based on Samsung and Apple , were sold alone 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
global sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
&quot; to this end , the well @-@ running business of the countless App @-@ providers and the telecommunications companies will come . &quot;
a whole industry has now emerged around the smartphone .
&quot; the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs on Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , everything by touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al march began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look . &quot;
&quot; eventually , she disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the Se@@ gen now has Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , every German now watches 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to put the Smartphone away once , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens executive board responsible for personnel . &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England needs to direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me it was the biggest attraction He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London , when we ran a big effort to ensure that all our nations and regions were benef@@ iting from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities , we are already offering 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of expansion He@@ ath@@ rows is too great . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blind@@ ed on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wron@@ ged in 2012 and they will also lie wron@@ g@@ ly at He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in swe@@ ating growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment in both the airport and the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have implemented a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion investment investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal until the T2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented run@@ ways in the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third track , which is backed by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
London &apos;s games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and M@@ ouse Play &quot; with regard to ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies who earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers tries to circum@@ vent ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisements on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus posted a blo@@ g@@ post in which users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertisements in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the coding for its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect it , which part of the site is advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; &quot; this kind of back @-@ and @-@ forth battle between the an@@ zei@@ gen@@ dered open source community and the conver@@ ters has already been underway since the invention of display lock@@ ers , and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has embar@@ ked on the fight is a strong indication of how high wor@@ rying indicators have become for the industry .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people use display lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ wer@@ bung holds 84 percent of the advertising revenue Fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company relies on desktop PCs on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on fac@@ ebook mobil@@ es app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , distributed a speaker . &quot;
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large share of revenues so that Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; ad pre@@ fer@@ encing tool &quot; &quot; to give people more control over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that adding new filters would be wor@@ rying because they would also block contents on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a stupid tool , which is why we have instead focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to put more control into the hands of people . &quot;
woman with suspected suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the motorway .
&quot; the police call witnesses , after a woman was driving on a highway in the early hours of the morning on Thursday with a suspected suicide of several vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened on the A1 , near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud , shortly after midnight . &quot;
&quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss in the age of 49 , who was attacked by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police said that , as well as any witnesses of the incident , asked to report . &quot;
&quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter made the Le Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a colli@@ sion avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not being held ac@@ coun@@ table .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the motorway , it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is running in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted after she survived a man and killed one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became un@@ conscious on the street , took the judgment . &quot;
&quot; the Court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman who had responded to an emergency call -- was justified in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ e@@ eable situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus once lived hab@@ itable
&quot; according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once inhabited . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could have revealed ground @-@ like conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still slowly sp@@ un . &quot;
the model also lit the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate lives and protected from rapid evap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent more .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus will expose her day &apos;s side to the sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS Scienti@@ st Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun &apos;s heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously thought by planets research .
&quot; although it was presum@@ ably hab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to excessive heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billions years . &quot;
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gene , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect - Venus , as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy goes back to Aval@@ an@@ che as a trainer
Patrick Roy appeared as trainer and Vice President of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che on Thursday and led to low co@@ determination right in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association is immediately looking for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of summer , I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it requires and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve this , the trainer &apos;s vision and Vice President of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization . &quot;
it must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick was informed today about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has won the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the best trainer of the league during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 .
&quot; he led the association to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches posted a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell short behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference by five points .

&quot; the labour struggles in terms of remun@@ eration for North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all parties for a new discussion sit at the table , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strike against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ a@@ dic@@ ally conducted on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the wra@@ pping process of the current struggle , &quot; it says in a common statement . &quot;
we will keep a few full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks that will begin next year to restart the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has shor@@ tened the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 % drop on on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company will give the company the needed space to come through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; shell has released thousands of people and plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ union with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; as a result of lower crude oil prices , energy companies are under pressure , an economic situation that had intensi@@ fied by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish Parliament member , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest labour disputes that took place since a generation in the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler space teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data will help astronom@@ ers understand why the stars in the Star Wars rotate at different rates as well as in which context the rotation periods are connected with planetary emergence .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star enh@@ ancements , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years away from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this con@@ stellation , which originated some 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood . &quot;
they are now in the quick@@ est way .
&quot; at top rot@@ ational rates , these ri@@ p@@ ening stars push large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the mag@@ net@@ fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the occurrence of an identi@@ fiable star spot -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars are turning slower than the massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es stars with dancers , with larger stars turn slower Pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still a lot ahead of us that we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars will slow their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eb@@ all @-@ star emerges
the tears flow@@ ed at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eb@@ all star in the best days from Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional withdrawal , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will be wearing the T@@ ampa Bay Ra@@ ys on 12 August against the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; to join , &apos; explained the 14 @-@ star All @-@ Star Game participants of Major League Bas@@ eb@@ all ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract awarded him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contrac@@ tion on 31 December 2017 , he will in future act as consultants and youth coach - at full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Navy ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es managed to make some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eb@@ all players rank similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be included in the Hall of Hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; - was in the field so controversial is its occurrence outside the square . &quot;
&quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star was at &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; to have banned ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
in August 2013 he was closed for 211 games due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 .
&quot; as the main susp@@ ect , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered as the main susp@@ ect to have received effective funding from an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida . &quot;
&quot; after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings . &quot;
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time . &quot;
also his f@@ arewell days are not no@@ is@@ eless .
&quot; while many bas@@ eb@@ all legends hit the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win each game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and attributed to the circumstances with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , got sympath@@ ies of the fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee arch@@ ri@@ val Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want a @-@ Rod , &quot; sang the followers at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; wi@@ pes : due to a positive dop@@ ing sample , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland may not start in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
an imag@@ inary ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh race , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese float in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 meter steep@@ le ch@@ ase in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been positively tested and excluded - immediately before the outbreak of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions , these news come to an end . &quot;
in Ch@@ en already last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been proven that is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
&quot; on Friday afternoon , CAS rati@@ fied the International Spor@@ ting Tribunal for its exp@@ ul@@ sion from the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had finished fourth in the final over 100 m of butter@@ fly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have attended the runs over 50 m of fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing was requested . &quot;
&quot; the national association takes the matter very seriously and demands full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the CAS International Spor@@ ty Tribunal and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , it is no longer the IO@@ C but the CAS for the sanctions of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also during the night of Rio , the news spread about the positive rehear@@ sal in Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive himself . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she is innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it should act on the prohibited substance for the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also have been positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not take the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , for example , all the wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ duty nation are not allowed to take part in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the fall of &quot; &quot; Adrian Se@@ inski &quot; &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg has been tested positive for the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on three days earlier . &quot;
&quot; both are disp@@ uting the intake , but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before starting the athletes , especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF World Federation had forbidden the entire Russian team except for systematic D@@ op@@ ings , the L@@ äu@@ er@@ nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming @-@ sport , the former clubs in China also caused severe disputes between the athletes . &quot;
Fr@@ ench@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt , purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to commit myself , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also the focal point of a dispute with the Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing frau@@ ds , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; sun was positively tested for the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ mil@@ azi@@ din in the Chinese champion@@ ships in 2014 , but only had to sit on a three @-@ month lock . &quot;

programmers from black@@ mail @-@ malware are currently target@@ ing targeted companies - and they are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey by the malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , sometimes several times victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to rede@@ em@@ ing ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes leader Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most paintings were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpet@@ rators discovered the black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in recent months start@@ ling fast . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works following a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , it searches specifically for recently modified files such as Word@@ - , Excel or Database files as well as for archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and er@@ ase the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail presses . &quot;
&quot; to get the end key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin - . &quot;
&quot; but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without shut down production . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware fails . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of affected German companies reported revenue losses caused by ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to complete their business activities completely , in one case , people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany there were already several hospitals offering victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of sick people . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims : pay not , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the claim by the perpet@@ rators in the face of stagn@@ ation in operation . &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers in turn know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure have investigated the usage areas and the contact with the users and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain to their victims via chat , how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set freely accessible support websites or dec@@ ryp@@ t free sample files . &quot;
&quot; and if private people rede@@ em for payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more professional and share their work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the antivirus supplier Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is three or four people . &quot;
the programmers sell their malware in the form of a software building kit to the actual ext@@ or@@ tions .
&quot; the previous malware @-@ kits were created by using the malware , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the scope of supply includes an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ ers are then looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; thus , one logs in one of the forums on the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and asks for another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per inf@@ ect calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually the crimin@@ als then over@@ see sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known to many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey place trust to defend Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of File @-@ Back @-@ ups and Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if data encryption alone does not pose a sufficient threat to successful measurement , the perpet@@ rators are threatening to release sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes leader Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means that the potential for damage , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the perpet@@ rators could take completely new targets on the internet of things in the future . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; &quot; Hack@@ er@@ konferenz &quot; &quot; def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked radiator could be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpet@@ rators , instead of heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new Jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1,60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear , it does not work in any place . &quot;
&quot; the interior materials of the interior are well @-@ finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cock@@ pit over@@ lay is falling apart . &quot;
more versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage box .
&quot; there is not only a 4@@ 53 l trunk with raised and 10@@ 26 l back@@ rests , but there are the &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical when it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded up like a chin @-@ up armchair and thus offer storage space , which is 1,@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , however the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V extremely powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; however , he should make his work a bit qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another mot@@ ori@@ zation : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; in the tested top @-@ version &quot; Executive , &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; the security systems belong to the City emergency brake assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the colli@@ sion warning system and the lane assist assistant . &quot;
&quot; the colli@@ sion war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates , because at the maneu@@ ver@@ ing many obstacles are rated as &quot; approaching objects . &quot; &quot;
the remote @-@ light assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed control respon@@ ds to the traffic sign recognition and cho@@ ke the speed on demand .
&quot; but the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 &quot; &quot; touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two USB and one HDMI bus@@ hing lie underneath the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to reach .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel are ok .
&quot; those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel starting at 23@@ 000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda is offering a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is conceivable only for haz@@ ards that are typical for aviation .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a kne@@ ec@@ ap in the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no compensation to the man .
case of illness : when does the organis@@ er pay
&quot; after their journey , vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back if the cause of the disease is to be found without doubt in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case when more than ten percent of guests have proven to show the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the negoti@@ ated case , a family was severely ill in di@@ arr@@ he@@ a and v@@ om@@ iting on the second day of their tur@@ mo@@ il holiday . &quot;
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
&quot; their illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective treatment plant , which suppos@@ edly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water . &quot;
the family had the view that the trip was defici@@ ent - and was charged with the organis@@ er .
the pla@@ inti@@ ffs had no success in court .
&quot; indeed , the sewage plant was in fact defective . &quot;
but the organis@@ er only heard of it shortly before leaving the pla@@ inti@@ ff .
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; he did not viol@@ ate his duties , so the judgment . &quot;
especially since there were no contam@@ in@@ ants found in the samples of water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ ag@@ ion among themselves - belonging to the general risk of life .
there were only 38 of 6@@ 91 guests .
&quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said , after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must have b@@ ump@@ ed and decided at the same time to react to terrorist threats .
it is certain that our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and division .
we will not grant this triumph to terrorists .
&quot; if crimin@@ als would have to leave the country more quickly , it hei@@ gh@@ tens the security and strength of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère aims to implement proposals for the 2017 parliamentary elections .
&quot; he also announced another personal reinforcement of the security forces , in a medium @-@ four @-@ digit order over several years . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; promoting terrorism must again be subjected to punishment . &quot;
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the tru@@ ce can be amended so that especially the purchase of weapons on the Internet is difficult . &quot;
the most recently discussed tail light for doctors is to remain intact after de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; however , he wants to seek solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , how the danger of the citizens can be reduced , he said with a view of psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social care needed . &quot;
teachers need to be better prepared to deal with traum@@ ati@@ zed people .
&quot; to pursue crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increasing safety . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly spoke against Action@@ ism .
&quot; this was an ear tag for the sni@@ per in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union following a bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of dual citizenship .
&quot; in constitutional law , it is a general ban on conce@@ al@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t for@@ bid everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
it is possible to talk about rules for example in traffic or for witnesses in court .
&quot; the Green Chief , Simone Peter , accused the minister to simul@@ ate vig@@ or and ability to act with new anti @-@ terror packages . &quot;
left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; fleet Pro@@ verbs and a tigh@@ tening of the right of residence bring people in this country no longer security . &quot;
better flow of traffic on the motorway
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the rule of law shall be extended .
&quot; this is good news for all car drivers , who are driving in traffic on the surrounding street every night in traffic when they drive over the motorway in Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday and Wednesday ( August 16 / 17 ) , the state farm road construction will be extended by 700 meters between the Hammer Street and the Wes@@ eler Strasse . &quot;
drivers can then thread directly from the Hammer street on the right .
&quot; the big advantage : traffic is divided early , thus improving the overall workflow on the busy section of the federal road 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea , with the extended exit , had the CD@@ U faction in the District of Mu@@ en@@ ster @-@ West . &quot;
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder anno@@ ys drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the route goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h road and sometimes beyond . &quot;
reason is the needle eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler road .
from here the traffic is directed only one lane through the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge is no longer the required load capacity , in order to primarily record heavy load traffic two @-@ wheel@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and associated structural con@@ ges@@ tion will continue , the competent state company cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to be expected : the bridge has an official remainder of the day until 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the rule of law , the state company deliberately chose the weaker period during the school holidays because with disabilities it was possible to calculate . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday and Wednesday , traffic is passed on to the construction site on a single lane . &quot;
intercultural Travel : cultural offers for schools
&quot; the international class of the forest school visited the play &quot; &quot; The invisible home &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge theatre are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos; s enables young people to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Trip &quot; initiated by the N@@ ima Society , 19 students between eleven and 15 years of age visited the st@@ aging in the Small House . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee camps , has the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , thus the press release of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos; s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z Wester@@ berg from spra@@ kel , and the Junge theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background will have the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers on comprehen@@ sibility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further . &quot;
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; given the increased refugee rate , the association counts with many classes that want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvement
the weather has made the con@@ stellation Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a stroke through the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the heavenly spectacle , the chairman of the Stern@@ warte Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said Friday morning . &quot;
our hope lies on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we will see a lot of shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the star@@ ters are Per@@ ei@@ ds , which with 216@@ 000 kilometers per hour belong to the quick@@ est star@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; they have their name because they appear apparently from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes up in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleep disorders
&quot; in the evenings you roll yourself etern@@ ally , at night you are hours awake , in the morning it is far from the wake @-@ ring no longer think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is with such problems in good society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing . &quot;
how are sleeping problems or sleep disorders ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there may be diverse reasons for them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for sleep @-@ up and sleep medicine . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ som@@ nia , therefore , is an entry and dor@@ man@@ t disorder . &quot;
&quot; in particular , many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines . &quot;
sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early w@@ aking is common especially for depression , &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot;
and it can be that different factors damp@@ en one another .
&quot; who , for example , has a disc failure , can be bad , wake up every two to three hours and possibly begin to pon@@ der on everyday problems and worry , adds an example . &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go to a doctor with sleep disorders ?
who does not sleep well over a period of one month at least three nights per week and is imp@@ aired on the day should go to the doctor .
&quot; impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is down@@ cast , tired , un@@ healthy , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to alle@@ vi@@ ate sleep disorder , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; the treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ question . &quot;
&quot; there is hardly any vac@@ ant sleep medicine in Germany , empha@@ sizes Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary care centre at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you should first contact the doctor in case of sleeping problems . &quot;
it can be clari@@ fied with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep or what happens ?
&quot; for an examination in the sleep laboratory , physicians , for instance , advise for snor@@ ing with breathing difficulties , in ab@@ normal fatigue , in sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if one does not find the cause of a dor@@ man@@ t disorder , explains Fi@@ etze . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a na@@ p , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after the wiring , one goes into the bed at its normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera records the sleeping @-@ end on the ceiling . &quot;
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a few adjusting screws on which you can set for a better sleep .
&quot; we@@ ther counts on : regular sleep and rise times , not too long in bed , on the day do not sleep , do not watch TV for sleeping , avoid alcoholic and don &apos;t look at the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and this is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to be
former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has vo@@ iced his comments on the dis@@ appo@@ inting cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is via Facebook .
&quot; in December 2014 , he took gold for the first time in Doh@@ a for the first time in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record . &quot;
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has protected himself from his ex @-@ team colleagues via Facebook .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20.000 € award and a jungle king of 150,000 euros no one should be surprised about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote to Friday on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in swimming is bad , but the dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look as closely as they can on the topic of dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set here , &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be announced nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled for a certain time before World Cup / OS of independent check@@ ers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not take part , &quot; &quot; says the choice Hamburg , who meanwhile runs an ice cream . &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ gage Rec@@ ei@@ ves arrested
professional th@@ iev@@ es at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , the civilian authorities of the Düsseldorf police managed to capture two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several pick@@ pockets and luggage lock@@ ers as a gang .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 clock civilian officials in the area of the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf airport suffered a gang , which was known to the polic@@ emen from last theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several crimes since the middle of July and were jointly , in a joint , work@@ able and particularly professional manner . &quot;
the specialists of the Criminal Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can demonstrate four acts specifically for the treatment of crimes committed specifically to Germany .
&quot; they captured a total of over 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lin@@ den trees , in between still a rest cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the R@@ ī@@ ga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in does not seem like that , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walking along the street from east to west , you come to play@@ grounds , a newly @-@ painted Kindergarten and a Bi@@ ol@@ aden . &quot;
someone &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed at the facade of a gray house .
&quot; opposite a Li@@ dl , who is to be torn down soon , it is already built : until 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , articles about this trendy district , such as the responsible property company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in , are preferred by burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the occup@@ ants have rent contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator H@@ enkel has expressed himself repeatedly for a hard action by the police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers were cleared , the police pat@@ rolled out official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site , blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors to enter the house with the number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile renovated building workers commissioned by the unknown land@@ owners .
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin administration court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers moved under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the street is peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain themselves . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main concerns of many people : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the neighbourhood since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who runs three children here , are generally generated by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the residents of the house projects , they share the concerns of increasing r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted a majority of police prot@@ ections from the v@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police between house owners and their neighbors make up , evi@@ dently does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which has a low average age and high poverty reduction even today compared to the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Straße close to the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been ev@@ acu@@ ated under a large police force in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the R@@ ī@@ ga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , in recent years , the district has become a magnet for tourists and poll@@ ers from all over the world . now residents of GDR times and former home@@ owners share their Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them on designed discs or newly painted fac@@ ades that were ej@@ ected using paint bags .
&quot; no other street was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one reason for not all neighbours to view this as a problem could be that they are not affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes like bodily harm are , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the off@@ ences make material damage , which tends to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ant beside the controversial 94 for 17 years , uncertainty cannot be a question of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who were not sure . &quot;
&quot; the famous burning cars , too , are no longer in the R@@ ī@@ ga anymore . &quot;
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer consciously moved into the R@@ ī@@ ga - and remained .
&quot; that is why it was so important that the local residents got their road back : from the police , politics and the media , all of which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city beyond the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street continues to be taken away : through fac@@ eless new buildings in former bridges , which displac@@ es the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; finally , these are con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so well @-@ affected , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if someone never list@@ ens to someone ?
&quot; fru@@ stration arises on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for tra@@ inees who are fre@@ eing about colour bombs : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
&quot; who pul@@ ls , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves to a pub neighborhood , can compla@@ in badly about noise there . &quot;
all persons presented only with names have asked to not be called by their right name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also social worker on site .
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commissioned by Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social peda@@ go@@ gue supports the team of the administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working group refugee support , administration , authorities and anyone else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ear@@ thy wool mel@@ low sau , which is above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; in such a way , some - less deri@@ ving but rather on the multitude of requ@@ esting areas of responsibility - meant , when the administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; a management specialist with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , was chosen to be an ins@@ ane wool mel@@ ee sau . &quot;
&quot; administrative work is not its central area , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it concerns organisation , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
firm of the Year for Private Construction Luther Firm of the Year for Energy
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Kunde , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems . &quot;
soon there are new containers in the W@@ as@@ en@@ strasse
it has been a serious problem for some time to find homes for the connecting flights that have been acknowledged .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
they must teach the refugees in their own or rented premises .
&quot; the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the commun@@ es themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the Federal Council Office to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
&quot; de facto , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far it was not working , if one relies on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common flats must be approved as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers will be placed in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine Customers and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a permanent residence , intern@@ ships , apprentic@@ es@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and support activities for refugees and migrants are necessary . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house master , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as reported by Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external action .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day takes a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so there are offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so you also jump here administration and volunteers .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they must explain to the refugees that it will take time and can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; whoever will develop the feeling , he could not help anyone in Ur@@ bach , should not work and be useless , he will never be integrated . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but there are problems , too , says customer hon@@ estly , &quot; &quot; people who do nothing at all . &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
that &apos;s all a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two after the recent occur@@ ren@@ ces fear radic@@ alisation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client quite clearly , &quot; what some people might call na@@ ive . &quot; a residual risk can and may not exclude them . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents were also subject to the refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins could completely call them back .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
therefore main and volunteers must look for activities in the region and in the region .
they have always been in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics abh@@ ors itself . &quot;
&quot; actually , it &apos;s unfair to put them on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would relax the situation . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher is already busy with it , so that the previous people can be integrated sensi@@ bly . &quot;
&quot; these are currently approximately 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : intru@@ der sought by helicop@@ ter
