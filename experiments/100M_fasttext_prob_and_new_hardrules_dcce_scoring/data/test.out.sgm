<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit of diversion with some colleagues with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their holidays, they hunted in fast gallop, home to the feeding stuff."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the equestrian ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany's best golfers were all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">"he let himself be led with his family through the system of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even go for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite impressive.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid handed over to the man from Anhausen as part of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">Honors do not lack the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Grand Cross, Silver Laurel leaf, Champions Tour Player of the Year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already spotted him.</seg>
<seg id="18">A long time is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">"on Saturday, he met Hans Günter Winkler in Aachen on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means very much to me," says Langer, "for it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">Langer has been promoting young talent for decades.</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros immediately."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 outstanding sportsmen, the two-time US master winner was added to the" Hall of Fame des deutschen Sports "on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the members include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the turner Eberhard Giengen, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Ruderer Hans Hanisch, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the hand baller Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and mumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trade deal - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the two US presidential candidates, however, are unaware of the tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a basic, more philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">On the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in doubt, Trump wants to remain small in doubt and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claiming Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively withdraw regulations, and he makes for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for private individuals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton says," "The state has certain tasks to fulfill, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open and needs money for it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes for the rich would increase, they say."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in this case, Trump and Clinton are almost worsening."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate has even announced the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly denied by the republicans of the state-critical team of Teaparty.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in Trump, there could also be partial-party discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and resume production of coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas to denounce the Paris climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to extend and demand renewables with its investment programme:" "a country will create the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, they both don't want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they are to be paid even better, demands about Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a wage for hunger.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to be rinsed, then he says he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months seems likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics argue that the budget deficit would only increase.</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, at least wanting from the rich wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every woman who has fled has experiences with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">"sexual violence is part of women who are fleeing themselves, almost everyday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house provides refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen four women sit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously in the space with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares at the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she realises that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles shortly and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is a business leader of Condrobs, a carrier of social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are refugees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs created the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Münchner Frauenhilfe."</seg>
<seg id="18">It has been officially opened for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - neither as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has made experiences on her flight experience with sexual violence," "says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically, because torture or death threaten them or because their families send them as hopefuls to Europe," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women, other reasons for escape:" many steal secretly because they don't see any other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, compulsion, murder, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run this goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs for example demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end as soon as they arrive in Germany, irre, says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and abused at worst."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, they appreciate."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience, because shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often don't know how to help, I need more accommodations only for them, demands Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district registrants are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the question of whether or not they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, there is something like that in accommodations of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Swabia alone, women who have escaped are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia there are some common shelters or houses for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The Committee "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women will be sheltered separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the privacy is missing or are housed together men and women, it can - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers, on comprehensibility, motivation for use, and new user requirements, with a view to improving IAB's web presence even further."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this need of protection can be seen at the rush, which there is to the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since it has been talking about us, we have a long waiting list," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily set up a second house.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistants argue: demands for new work fighting measures</seg>
<seg id="2">Deputy of the assistant physicians have called their union to approve new work fighting measures in their dispute with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The JDC's Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) called for its complete council to approve more labour competition measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC suggested that ministers had failed to address the concerns of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistant physicians and medical students agreed to reject a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members who had been published on Twitter Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was" "persky quiet" "issues, which led to the fact that the treaty was rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said:" "given this, the JDC Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and solicit official new negotiations for all your worries."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in response to the silence of the government, the JDC Board today set a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve a running programme of escalating labour competition measures that begin at the beginning of September."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the dispute ended that assistant physicians were arguing six times this year, the first total outages in the history of the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the BMA assistant physicians Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="12">"he granted BMA members during the meetings, which were still held before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students, to ensure that the contract was beneficial and accepted."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands, and to proclaim an official end to the eight month long war of words and economic sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny myself the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smiles were misty and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, spoke repeatedly of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report whole five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but to improve themselves."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan behaved as if it had never happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">His enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's brilliant, sustainable refrigeration showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was flooded.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin expired and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even bigger since it was done by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the confidence will be difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media ran a heavy, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for all.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the accusations by leading officials were the most serious accusations that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead."</seg>
<seg id="24">"after all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse that he wanted to hear from the President Erdogan."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan mainly needs all the friends he can get after having been dismissed at a failed coup d "état last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved if the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti expressed it as follows:" tourists there lang, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West because its reaction to the attempted takeover of power was regarded as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the ongoing grudge of the EU accession negotiations and Putin's snail pace will continue to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian Head of State won in Ankara with security a bonus for calling for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well-evident for Moscow, a matter of course, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regiment."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray an" "alliance of outsiders" ": two countries that have been violating and treated badly from the West and are now allied."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks both presidents spoke at the press conference that they didn't even cope with the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey refused to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey exploded the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in Tallinn in 1972, he graduated at the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin website, it is called (in Russian) that he later was the principal of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Executive Officer."</seg>
<seg id="10">He told Putin about his nomination: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the government's most important task to support your work as Head of State in respect of the draft laws and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and Vaino recommended as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Persuade the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has taken place in Moscow in a mysterious way.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for a long time, Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest confidants to Vladimir Putin and worked as he was for Soviet intelligence, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>

<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion that a man who was once touted as a potential president at once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - ran across large scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks on Putin, which are cited on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated job - you could almost say - troublesome items for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to that he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin a former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"as Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted in most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that Ivanov could be president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term Putin had violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, close ally to Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of Queensferry crossings to the Viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected with Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "ceiling fans", "which approach the completion in order to approach each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 oblique cables."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister Keith Brown today made a visit to the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historic and symbolic moment in the Queensferry crossings building.</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all the witnesses of an engineering of a truly epic proportions in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the total deck are at their place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete gong for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first shutter represents a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"in this fantastic project, the closure is a forward-looking high and low construction."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last street covering and its connection with the expansion of the northern tower, we had to close the existing gap on the north or south side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive since the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs around 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at a gradient of approx. 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the tolerances on which the team were working tiny, they were only a few millimetres on each side."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who is building cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The German Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Greens believe that investors should be put into duty much more strongly in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Brunswick will lose almost 1300 low-priced apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"at the next session of the session, the SPD proposes a" "Action Concept" "concept."</seg>
<seg id="5">But quarrel is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all it is about the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD faction leader Christoph Bratmann says:" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas must prove 20 percent of all flats as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be found in the inventory."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the main point of dispute in the town hall is, as Bratmann says:" how to deal with investors who want to build on private land? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as less as 20 percent of homes as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new municipal housing funding programme, which will cost millions of dollars and still need to be financed, should provide incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, such as Bratmann:" there is currently no agreement between the fractions. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make a few prescriptions to investors.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder editions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of that, so Bratmann, a tightening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"however, the programme is not entirely new: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how do you compare the loss of some 1,300 cheap apartments, whose promotion will expire in the coming years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this from happening, the planning-policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, should now be bought ongoing ties from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to the price."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western town.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one blow the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">"because in the western town, deadlines run at the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 dwellings you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: this is what the owners, the housing companies do not want."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the western city is increased dramatically, one is from the aim of the so-called mixing."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"group leader Holger Herlitschke comments:" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go into the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">This has concentrated on more construction sites for single-family houses.</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean that a compromise can not yet be found.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"teenagers and children no longer go outside to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens, staring on screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time at the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on videogames and most recently on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later they created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"how many phenomena of pop culture decreased interest before the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overload the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, the players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons tracked with a GPS and once they were found" "photographed" "(via a screenshot on the mobile) or" "captured". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" average "person recounts every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35.000 users, recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of tracking people who practice 30 minutes each day, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - only the raw data for performance improvement.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health that people want to take" "30 minutes of time", "" "come from the sofa" "and" "get active each day" "biting on deaf ears, because many public messages are boring for health and come from people that look appealing."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone driving sports regularly reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even include new friendships during the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also malogies that have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could walk against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could already track our activity before, they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be reproduced over time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year old girl shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks since a decade in the first mass murderous crime of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and heard music."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said."</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone and Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the Women's Olympics in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984, and the USA has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"second: this team has three turner, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin colour."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, who is Catholicon, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally mirrors the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic feminine presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among the female gymnuns was an American Afro American."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic medalist and America."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple World Championships, Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected but masterful gymnastic routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone was the fourth heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-battle rally for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but so the gymnastics classes in the whole country do not look out."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all kicked off the same way as Aly and Madison to join the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" Last Five, "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnsts in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality is that gymnastics are a more expensive sport and gymnasts in the first place in private gymnastics which are maintained by parents who pay for training, orientation, travel, clothing, competitive and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued as desired."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sports clubs are in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these associations, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started with the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to offer the communities aun innumerable, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easy-to-access gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my turnstile of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"for my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (especially black and Hispanic) and train national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this fantastic Olympic sports."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long advantages for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team to bring thousands of young girls interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine presentation of" Girl Power "by holding the Olympic team gold and thanks, you are motivated as many young girls with varying backgrounds to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="4">"the first assistant physicians will receive a new contract, which includes changes to bedside and weekend work to improve the care for unchanging hours."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA committees for resident physicians, informed the last night in a message:" "assistance specialists have serious concerns about the proposed treaty, in particular that it will incur the current occupation crisis and to administer it all the doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">"with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and the time runs out."</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes by discussions broke with the government on the contrary to take part and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">"this happened to a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made last month, that his door would always be open."</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness to flourish election fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutsk Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to wiping broadly widespread deception in Muslim communities as a crushing government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Sir Eric Pickles, former cabinet member, attacks the police, election observers and town halls to ignore evidence of election abuse as a result of" intolerances concerning ethnicity and religion. ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former minister of integration and local government, which is now an anti-corruption scandal, said that the intimidation of voters out of religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut-off bands outside of electoral college to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should lead a proof to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter must simply call his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report proposes to apply non-removable inks to a person's finger, when they leave their vote to prevent someone to vote twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He urges that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or workgroups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this serves not only against electoral fraud, but also to protect the municipal government against the wider corruption and financial culture that is associated with it," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets Wahlskandals in eastern London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special electoral court decided that the incumbent mayor Luton Rahman should be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he would have brought his critics to silence with racism and Islamophobia accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Rahman is said to" "have led" "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>
<seg id="16">"up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of imitation, in which one person was chosen as someone else."</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he expressed alarming to the fraudulent correspondence - in which older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the polling system, including the driving license to prove the identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"in its report it is said:" "evidence was attached that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised, especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elders, in particular communities with Pakistani or bangladian background."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... state institutions have unknowingly ignored such behaviour as a result of "politically correct" insensitivity in respect of ethnics and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists deal with briefing documents to stop" "harvesting harvests". ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report taken into consideration by Theresa May requires tougher registration checks, in order to prevent the electoral index to be used for immigration and social security purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic reviews about the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban that political activists deal with full post-elections and envelopes of postelections.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the power to set off lockouts for election stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A amendment made by an indictment for intimidation in accordance with the repression of the People Act 1983.</seg>
<seg id="31">Photographer prohibition in election stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the voting stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that employees rule out that voters alone go to the Election Cabin.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlet case no criminal complaint was put.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as unusable," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">It was found guilty due to a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective "checkpoints" of the election registers of the Town Hall.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Eric said," The judgment in Tower Hamlets of last year was a warning signal. "</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country carries a proud heritage as the mother of the parliaments, but the worrying and hidden spread of election fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your robber."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you approach you from behind, then you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and" go out of the line, "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"take it then with your knee to the bar and twisting while the attacker breaks up against pain, the weapon comes out of his hands. hit him with the run into the face and move backwards, while she directs the weapon to him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the weapon and twisting it, so that the attacker cannot shoot."</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright disguises his tongue to the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveler underwent a serious test of his immune system and stranglehold by detecting some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the host and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk put his course on a Euro ticket, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a traction toilet as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of its immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"prior to the leakage of each object, he used a photometer to show himself and us what he is going to do."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was screened under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results in daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought of debacing the rinsing button of a towing toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely abruptive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals on the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he tasted, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowel, traveling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to train stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task presented its immune system definitively under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"he told me in the film:" already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and sludge water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he justified his reputation in any case."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its sample line showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the number of newly washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to refuse after their Luminometer numbers were over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", "which shows the bacterial count at different places like the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film, he says:" "that comes close to the worst thing I have germinated in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to lick here anything because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus that contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explain the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We introduced crazy brainstorming that ended that we said "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the film directing, added:" let me tell me this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed him, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to put them off and others where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents identified lactic acid bacteria particularly with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing milksacial bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilbury were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, the housing association created the property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls had clad holes, wooden boards were ripped, trash was scattered on the floor and graffiti was decorated on the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family were resettled and it is assumed that they now live in a private housing</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for the property management at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "It was an absolute nightmare for the people and I think people don't have to live in this way."</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is likely to be considered as not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is as well.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror which the family had added, street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screams, strikes and curses included."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found"</seg>

<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delogid her and her partner forcibly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.</seg>
<seg id="17">Delogierung was cheered by lightened neighbours who said that their life was made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," They were not afraid of anyone. ""</seg>

<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will be beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house where the police were called periodic, 20 years long"</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the community house garbage and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" it is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family, as delogiance is always the final step to consider Cornwall Housing. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"this was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme and had to be horrible for their neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageously listened to us and have given us the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and conveys the message that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money was for a grave of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="37">"having been without shelter, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many walls of the house were graded with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police said they will navigate the renters who do not stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall informed that Delogierung is a clear warning to the other tenants that do not stick to the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think that they can behave without self-reproach, as well as those who were harmed by such a behavior," she said. "</seg>

<seg id="5">"Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she had anticipated to leave the country-operated country and return to England."</seg>

<seg id="2">"whoever does not fit and looses Erdogan sits on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-close Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">The Kurdish community of Germany pays tribute to tens of thousands of people who escape from Turkey to Germany at short notice.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term, it might even become" "some hundred thousand", "the president of the Association believes Ali Toprak."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to the harsh taste of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the attempted putsch, the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with a few hundred thousand protection-seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition," says the remaining Ali Toprak of the "World" on Friday. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government had already outstripped Kurdish strongholds with sanctions, 500,000 Kurds were fleeing within Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the ousted coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to restart in Europe if they are further repressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that even takes refugees, produces refugees in their own country," Toprak said. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the bandage leader complained of the systematic resettlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevitic cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, Erdogan wants to increase the outliers to the remaining Kurds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or expelled in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The German government demanded that the Federal Government is positioned as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its followers.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also in Germany a "witch-hunt" against Erdogan-critic takes place.</seg>
<seg id="16">I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">"more Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Oppositionists."</seg>
<seg id="19">The branding as a Gülen practitioner destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.</seg>
<seg id="20">"whoever does not fit and looses Erdogan sits on packed suitcases, incidentally also the Kemalists and seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-affiliated Foundation Dialog and Education, the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="21">"as reported by the newspaper calling on numbers of the Federal Ministry of Interior, the Turks introduced the largest group of asylum holders for political persecution in Germany before the coup."</seg>
<seg id="22">"on June 30, this was 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all as asylated purchases (39.625)."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals won't get anything from the summer election campaign - and the tourists from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the land tag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in 2021, the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"for stupidity than hitherto, it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and day-to-day struggle - this bites."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the election fighters, are on vacation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen and Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the land tag."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang posters, inflate air balloons, distribute flyers and count on votes in the end, can only be dealt with arduously."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until 4 September 2016, the Election and last holiday-day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again has to pass a campaign against the people over themselves."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, Leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly lagging behind the CDU."</seg>
<seg id="13">"it will be exciting, how strongly Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition agreement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sella, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous campaign, one can see from his grandparents."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through the land, distributes roses and chatting a little with the people, just as it did his legendary word-carger forerHarald Ringstorff."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Seelions got cold feet and gives chancellor Merkel the blame for the blossoming of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"her refugee policy, her" We create that "accelerates the rise of right-wing populists, which now probably cost him the beautiful office."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when one makes election campaigns at the wrong time at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice been invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale talks; Merkel Bundestagrotkreis is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target audience did not vote, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg-Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority from other states," complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR. "</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's a pity for anybody from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">"apart from that, the North-East CDU has largely renounced the usual election campuses on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"that, so says Kokert, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union has also noticed that in the country, it is the basis that it must be very strict, to find a wire to the people again."</seg>
<seg id="26">"you are doing it like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the expanses of the country there is hardly any available."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU election campaign Kokert to his comrades is also self-exposing:" "they have to go where it hurts, namely, where people are: Dorfleste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"because there is a lot in the game, Sellering has now called his SPD into a particularly committed campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, the social democrats last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and only just before the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"at the election of 2011, the SPD had yet to win 35.6 percent before the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, the petty party with seven percent in the surveys, are likely to make the leap into the land-day."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the holiday-need and spend their campaign largely on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign," says the Chairperson of Claudia Müller. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"apart from that, green campaigners embark on searching for native voices among holidaymakers."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the top candidate, curvats just with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg Lake and finds it even beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "holiday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."</seg>

<seg id="2">The speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">"there are praise for those who are responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30am in the morning and only end at 8pm."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they did everything pretty zacky," "tells Elvira Tetzlaff of the jet fuel station."</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no deduction.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at the beginning of the week, the construction site was moved to the south as scheduled, until the end of October everything should be finished."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the award is also presented for those responsible for building work, for instance when it comes to the furnishing of housings."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site has been moved on Monday to the south, and also the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Oftersheim has been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg is back again, the traffic situation inside the place has relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from the B 27 from Oftersheim to the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The exit traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>

<seg id="13">"the local residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many sneak trails were looking for and more familiar with their Navi than the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to some heavy trucks in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were not met, the municipality demanded to intensify the measuring vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there have been significant exceeding," says King, who made herself aware of the situation on the spot. "</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been flashed.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the road with 77 hours kilometres in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has moved on, it has become more quiet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"for the businessmen at the B 27, it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again."</seg>
<seg id="21">Businessmen don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, that the B 27 refurbishment has led to revenue brooks, everyone you ask is to look through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"who has less to do with the end customer, i.e. for other companies, for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"also at the dealership Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "at most slight drop", "but also grants that" "course" "is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the locals along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the restaurants have hit it hard."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil."</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every euro sales.</seg>

<seg id="34">He has to release half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have responded differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, President Jörg Schmidt responded to a request from Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, otherwise benefiting from the advantages of the situation at the B 27."</seg>
<seg id="37">"GÖHNER knows from other counties, where more generous is handled."</seg>
<seg id="38">"with all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been here since 1715, and refers to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"that other regular guests can now look less frequently due to the complicated traffic guidance, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you cannot drive, it is also somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the fact that its trunk-air comes back after the end of the refurbishment work, Göhner has no doubts about it."</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 building on his clientele for the biggest crisis, which has experienced its restaurant in its long-standing history."</seg>

<seg id="1">It is constantly being screwed up in the name of the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="2">"after the recent attacks, the Interior Minister de Maizière presents a thick security package."</seg>

<seg id="10">"however, as Minister of the Interior, he was lying on results and in a" recoverable consensus "within the Coalition."</seg>
<seg id="11">"after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière took a little while before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="12">But they are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"a lot has already been announced, announced, announced, that a new security authority to take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "it is not the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU rules on passenger information and weapons law."</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising as well.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in part, de Maizière starts a second attempt for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and knock jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these will be difficult points for the SPD," says the CDU man. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, he still considers this to be reasonable and do not demand anything that has no chances in the coalition partner anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas also present de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them have in themselves: he plans quick procedures for deportations and more possibilities for detention of people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">"refugees who are targeted at the country, should previously check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security check."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in cases of expired asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than so far - such as committing criminal offences or deliberately throw away their papers in order to disguise their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of it is politically and legally sacred.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some also have an uneven effect and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the unequal treatment of patient for example - raises the question: what actually does this have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, de Maizière said it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people worried about security in the face of high refugee numbers."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things that people were deeply involved, let us not cling to election times even in election times."</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner safety is enormously placed in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"yes, there are competitions."</seg>
<seg id="35">Union and SPD are therefore increasingly putting themselves in place on the issue of inner security.</seg>
<seg id="36">"in the past few days, there was a high level between the two parties."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a sudden strife about the equipping of the federal police, then a security-political idea collection of some EU interior ministers, in which the councils also demand a burka ban and a reversal from the dual citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière also arks here for conciliatory sounds.</seg>
<seg id="39">"from a turn away from the double-pass, he is not holding anything."</seg>
<seg id="40">We have talked about the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">To reopen it is not useful.</seg>
<seg id="42">And with a burka ban he has constitutional objections.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Boards: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men of middle aged children love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you come to the comment section to see him under the pseudonym" "Non-Allegria Men's Mediator" "with rough insults, this statement derives from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the much discussed reformation of vinyl records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a plate are all foresight at the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most improbable buyer group."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horror caused by hobbies - it has an emotional significance: older plate sellers keep their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But vote the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while I run in Soho, a modest gray suit and run wild, before I stick, hold my hands and say something determinant like:" so let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera off for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observing.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I am from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three men middle aged) into Reckless Records (Number of files: eight men middle aged, a woman, presumably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and re-buy items he sold when he was young and plunged."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things that I probably was too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records, are rather introverted and gladly spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers whom he meets will meet YouGov's profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"but he also noticed a new wave of people affected by the media pe, people who have heard about the comeback and are prompted to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people usually have got rid of their collection in the same way around 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs now to buy their records," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of a specific age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offers a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers received an impetus to the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, from objects that call lucky youth memories."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of emptiness or property of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "says Wez."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it's the case with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is an easy way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" instilled a staff of a pile of plates.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month, have not yet listened to them."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">At that time of the news report I would probably look very worried while I was puzzled by a stack of bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of Points: three men of middle aged age) has noticed a" "trophy" "of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here only recently and said," "I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead soundboard so that I can put them into the shelf," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product-friendly, less musicastic."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a turntable."</seg>
<seg id="43">"they are younger people, not older ones, who only slowly come in."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a blower audience than I am going in."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the aforementioned stores - Wild Beasts's latest synthesizers and sexbeetter pop instead of experimental jazz from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks very lonely, but psychological traumas are hard to imagine if you stand next to someone 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of boards available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It is rather a shopping-shopping-shopping than a wholesale purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, therefore collecting records is not a real option, it says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way but the beauty of records is... it drives off with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I look at the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are wondering to buy a Crosley turntable."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a stairwell, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these objects means more money for the industry and some customers might send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, who has more time and money than others, is the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as boards."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research shows that the results of YouGov are right, at least in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record shops and online forums, leave them unconsidered."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with strolling through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they avoid the starring look of an uncanny, thirty-year old false announcer who raises nothing reminding middle-aged men over the shoulders."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a trial of this week the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary shops selling, selling hairdressing services, or selling tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would include a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also led out that the Provisional Government and Restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the judge Jean-François Molla said that the groceries, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely to feed people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that was threatened by the rainfall was the Jungle Book Kids" Café of the camp, which is non-profit-driven and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"over 170,000 people signed the petition to protect the Kids" Café. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian it meant that" "closing" "for these children would be a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old."</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated that the number of those who live in the jungle has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"Britain's impressive performance during the 7-year rugby reached an abrupt halt in the final hurdle in the form of the Fijis, when they were defeated at the Deodoro stage here in Rio on Thursday evening."</seg>

<seg id="3">"from the first stroke to the last, 220 hard Hieve that enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"even if there were only those who sat on the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the response of the trainer Robin Williams was only present when she was promoted to the second Olympic champion in the second without a tax wife, the first women in the history of British sport, who put on such a scale."</seg>

<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant athletes, who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumphal effect."</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make up the incremental progress that make the difference and it was nobody lifting than the trainer who would not know if he was diagnosed with cancer this day at all.</seg>

<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you don't do that, it is spreading everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the break down to a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to go better again soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice."</seg>

<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is a challenge but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of the victory her first thoughts came to Williams, who spent a nerve-raging morning doing something more than usual and tried to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"panning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said" "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's a bit extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it only repeats how much that means, how much I and Helen and Robin worked."</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach of the world."</seg>

<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning won't lose any race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up, Stanning and Glover had too much to reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>

<seg id="31">It is really important not to let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not out of doing something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race we did."</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-driven and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened by green electricity subsidies are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the release of the Renewable Energies levy in the German steel industry, Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), said the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday issue)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"accordingly, the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases coming from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry increased additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel told the WAZ, there is now a fundamental agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators are replaced in the steel mills, they pay off an EEG levy of 20 percent."</seg>
<seg id="10">But also this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission on self-planing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, the status quo of the current regulation will be largely written."</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign 'Steel is Future', this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"others need to follow." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"even in the reform of the emissions legislation, climate and employment targets are to be lessened," IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann explained in Frankfurt. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry has suffered under overcapacity and a considerable price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation continued to aggravate when the world's largest producer of producers drove crude steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has become somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, imposed customs duties on import steel have impact, on the other hand, economic prospects have risen in China."</seg>
<seg id="22">Unclear how sustainably the price-picking is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German branch of the branch of Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, the prices would have stagnated."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp also did not want to exclude loose ends of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the German steel industry, around 860,000 people were employed at the end of 2015."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, the German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>
<seg id="29">"with 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year, such as the economic association steel on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a short upliftment in May, the quantity produced now went back to the second month in a row."</seg>

<seg id="2">"singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in school choir, in teacher's studies she occupied the subject music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall alive, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good about her health and her mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Singen is a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German seniors division."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most senior citizens sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular interaction, seniors can socialize and cultivate social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" to speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be strenuous in the positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">Seniors training a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Anyone who regularly demands his lungs will not get out of the puff even in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Group of Senior Citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generation, common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening of songs in older people wakes up a lot of memories, often associated with positive sentiments of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"through lyrics and especially melodies, dementia causes people to fall back on long-lying episodes."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head also demands special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to concentrate on one's own voice and rhythm at the same time, and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"even older people, who live alone, practice not only to concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition you hear through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I do something for a long time, I become better and awoke beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he thinks little talent reveals Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who is hearing when a sound goes along?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"sorry, there is no translation for this news-article."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can easily join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can directly contact the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for help with internet research."</seg>

<seg id="8">She is first-author of the study published on this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in a previous study, the research team already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens-cries differs from the urgency of their dependency."</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of nine adult males and eight females were observed from the MHH animal husbandry.</seg>
<seg id="11">They were performed for a call of little ones who were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and sibling.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on the other hand, they were confronted with cries of more strongly aroused kittens, which were raised additionally."</seg>

<seg id="16">This ability may possibly be innate or develop with the sexually mature.</seg>
<seg id="17">"a surprise was that the males ever responded," "said the biologist."</seg>

<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist rebellion or with international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"on the contrary, it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were laid."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities have received intelligence for imminent attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact date and places."</seg>

<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applied for the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were unsuccessful a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution adopted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Junta leader and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to cause chaos, while the country moves towards stability, improvement of economic situation and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, retains the power to restore the kingdom to stability and order."</seg>

<seg id="8">But it was not his straight sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming more well-known in underrepresented countries.</seg>

<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney the run of Eric Moussambani provided media attention.</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to stand alone in a pre-run over 100 metres of freestyle."</seg>
<seg id="21">Frenetically Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>

<seg id="1">"the fees per cubic meter of wastewater are from 1 October 2016 for the area of sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Third leg 3.44 instead of till now 2.10 Euro; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3,36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azores 3,64 euros (up to now 2.18 Euro)."</seg>
<seg id="2">"at the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will be increased at the latest once corresponding improvement measures are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after an overlay calculation, the sewage-price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter."</seg>
<seg id="4">"as mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, during the approval of the budget by the Federal Council of Kulmbach, there were undercoverings for these sewage systems."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to legal grounds, the Casendorf market is obliged to operate the facilities cost-effectively."</seg>
<seg id="6">"from 1 October 2016 onwards, citizens and industrial companies from World Bank, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases lie between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as Director of the Board of Directors, Herbert Schmidt displayed the Board, a new calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 over- or undercoverings from the previous calculations period will be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the engraving increases are based on the fact that there are relatively small facilities in all three sewer systems with a very low waste water attack, which lies between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, due to the low distribution basis, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low distribution basis."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the sewage system in all three systems is slightly retrograde."</seg>
<seg id="13">"furthermore, due to their age of refurbishment and repair expenses, the lapidating period of calculations did not last considerably due to their age of refurbishment and repair expenses."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the plant in Azendorf was nearly 30 years old, the facilities for World Choir, Neudorf and Reuth and Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old."</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the sewage plant in Azendorf because of a damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the Pumpwerk World Bank, the nearly 20 years of old conveying systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and at the pond treatment plant Lopp had to be extended after nearly 20 years, the sewage sludge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to keep the water-legal requirements in future."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Schmidt:" "for these extraordinary expenses, the continued care and maintenance costs, which have to be taken into account in the new calculation period, came into consideration."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which were significantly below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012."</seg>
<seg id="19">"stone houses made it clear that in the low waste water attack in the three systems, expenses for operation and maintenance were completely broken."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Schmidt, the market town of great entertainment costs for wastewater facilities in the past 20 years has been spared."</seg>
<seg id="21">"according to Steinhäuser, the situation for the above-mentioned facilities will continue to remain precarious as one could not expand the supply area of the sewage purpose association Friesenbachtal, because it is concerned with deficient facilities."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat states that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its Filtertool, it allows Snapchat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the absurdity."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure, which could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are indestructible, self-propelled tools that generate more than 30 million new selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All wrong entries are directed to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the past, Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were accused that the app would promote Blackface conducive or white skin as a beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them slotting, false teeth and grown cheeks, there were some critics a racist caricature from Asians -" yellow face. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversy had been indicative of a larger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it had deactivated the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was designed as a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who experienced racism, the filter reminded of hurting clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweet was widely spread across the photos, was that the filter was" hurting and bark said uncomfortable. "</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>

<seg id="20">"when one of Snapchat's filters creates a picture that is offensive for a user," so it's much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was the case, "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and others decided to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay on media and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that racist controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the attitudes practices of Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu also criticized the big part of white, only male leadership and ended their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say what to do about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely unanswered the Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures for the diversity of its staff and points to its status as a private company.</seg>

<seg id="2">"military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to portray an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as the actual conditions were allowed on site, an inquiry committee of the congress declared in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican Members of the Republican Guard, Intelligence Committee and the Defense Minister, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic state."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, just cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence-based information, typically fed off by high-level Centcom commanders, regularly drawn a more positive picture of US efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on site, and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," "quoted a newspaper article."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," noted Ken Calvert, republican member of the House of Representatives. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The guide faults in Centcom reach up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows in detail consistent issues in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there are no direct references to the fact that government tips under Obama gave instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to the pressure from their superiors, a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements prior to Congress were much more positive than the facts presented."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a Centcom candidate publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mozambique can begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command's tips changed the intelligence reports to play down the threat of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after it was played that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed knowledge while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway through the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">The democratic members of the intelligence committee published their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the republican task force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015 Centcom created an overly limited process for the preparation of intelligence services to ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "the highest ranking Demokrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, announced in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, so Mr. Ship," delayed the publication of intelligence reports, "damaged the morals under analysts and" gave moderately little space for divergent opinions. "</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the Democrats did not give evidence of a White House intervention at CentCom analysts with regard to a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon General Inspector, following complaints from Centcom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on any reports of the Congress while the general inspectors were still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also indicated that" experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have further effects on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"the accusations last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of feuds of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, had looked at the recommendations of many analysts only a small crew of occupation in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker insisted that, contrary to the statements of the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these provisional refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"however, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms damaliger, commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the Legislative for his excessive positive appraisal of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">"one day after they had shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0."</seg>
<seg id="3">"five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their doors in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, she knows: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Briton in the first place, which after their 2-0 victory against Japan remain undefeated."</seg>
<seg id="7">The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two teams will reach the first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place-placed will take a little longer from the path that will lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"whatever the game is on Saturday, the Americans have sparked a surprising hurricane by their success story, four years after they ended up in the last of 12 squares at the last London Games."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey beat in hands (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), with 16 years ago she became National player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">"she missed the Olympics in 2008, because she could not qualify for the cadre."</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an English, coach of the National Team, became a better turning point."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the working group in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to snatch the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the goattire in the first half of the game with a backlash out of the close-up area.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India was going into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she executed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and then knocked the ball into the gate to give the female a 2-0 guided tour."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the US doorkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next match on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"wherever you are, as late as it is also, there are the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Rio de Janeiro events feel consistent and inescapable, a rapid unceasel between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the olympic torch is itself a burning rod that is served by the wristband to the swimmer to the turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn off the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbor in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's black with dimples, could have been under these familiar names that would have been sent to Prime Time, if he were a swimmers, turner, or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic Trampolines."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame doesn't illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"sports that are not generally accepted: air pistols, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may there be long.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should rather make arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampolines have been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had been their debut in Sydney, the last 16 years have been so annoyed that many of them, I had asked, did not know that it is actually an Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the US sent athletes for competition, it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had a athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for both the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outage charme, partly because it fits for the unenlightened ear suitable for a clowns school than that for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humoristic potential - the cartoonious trembling of his never ending impact, but also the grace of exercising and diving, the two sports that essentially unites it."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" jumping board. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"you will be evaluated according to the official Olympic program according to version, level of difficulty and flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">"athletes of 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists in her quest for gold go on, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and back, up and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they hunt not only the finish line or the output wall, but also another highlight in the television transmission: the world or the Olympic chords."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the targeted quest is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even stir up a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I think of when watching these games as something tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">"of this, the trampoline offers a breathing spell."</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">Forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly upward again."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is a competition, of course, not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no tactical attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, but the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final round as part of a follow-up block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia-Manie, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil."</seg>
<seg id="39">"when the increase in consciousness can be achieved only through the fear and the objective of male athletes - as the male US Turner proposed recently - according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his air to rinse, new fans."</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia cause violent opposition to the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig protesters during the collisions with the police were killed by firearms.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just collapsing?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in recent months, protests against the government shook the country and spread to more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">"last week, thousands of people rushed into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes."</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the response of the government was unmerciful."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses indicate that policemen were shot on dozens of unarmed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year show how security men beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Security Council for Human Rights now demands an in-depth investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa's project leader, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"in Nigeria, Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West."</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorists beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are generally quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but an example for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, and dissidents were effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or in prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"when you suppress people and these have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," "said Seyoum Teshome, a professor in central Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use up to stranglehold in relation to the power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"following a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions along the border to Eritrea increase; a struggle for this jagged, disputed line demanded hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been forced by more or less in recent years, could use the turmoil and arm themselves again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness continue to explode under the surface after years of recoil from the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in recent years, many Ethiopia have been able to communicate with the social media, since cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the Internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are staying."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians announced that they were so protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, the Amharas, which come from orthopedics predominantly to Christian high-lands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this too does not change.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos."</seg>
<seg id="39">The greatest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for approximately 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, had until his death in an unpublished illness in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special officers to process enemies and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unknown reasons to take the position of Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after protesting thousands against elections, apparently pledged by the government and subsequently stolen by the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed even if there were less than in the past months and this time of disturbances passed relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts lobbied Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misgivings of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month protesters in Gondar, an amharous city, attacked by Tigray and the hatred towards the Tigray becomes more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights across the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally collapsing in an already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin line of terror."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his statement Obama founded ISIS 'sarcasm'</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump attempted to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking that his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the" founder "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification threw up new questions on the communication skills of the Republican candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensible with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings his fellow-comrades, who try to take care of him during an eventful period, to explain in the peculiar position, statements which he could not have meant at all."</seg>
<seg id="5">"having made the hint at an election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump summoned back to the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was contrary to the previous day, on which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the apology completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump might help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate would not want to know about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism falls down on Mr. Trump as he tries to steer the focus of his campaign due to falling demand values on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump attempted to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clintons would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he drew a strong criticism, when he thought that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clintons of emails, but later he explained" "Of course I said that sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone linguistic boundaries in politics and then recuperate as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his ways to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then if necessary" clarify "depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, who watches the language of both candidates. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed an etched tone as his inquiries continued to decline."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist published on Friday showed a leading edge in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump in general tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to dismiss his statements or misunderstand his humor."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is stepping up in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps sharmoned his loyal companions in the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements might be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York, and one of the most prominent intercessors, had great difficulty in defending the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "said Mr. Giuliani to the correctness of Mr. Trumps assertions, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backwarders, completely wrong and that's why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream Republicans attempt to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to spread itself aggressively under control of the situation in the Middle East."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of carrying around on each of his words and being taken against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he ridiculed the" poor, chambered "TV professionals trying to understand him and said," They can't! ""</seg>

<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>

<seg id="11">"brick, 54, ordered a freshwater sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate."</seg>

<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that spends the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">Code grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it has to be placed in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women cook for male rims and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "draws the roads with which the country moved with it no longer to be the land of land."</seg>

<seg id="23">"the new budget was equally tense: mysterious foods such as loaves and asseroles became staple foods, the casserolle as a" wonderful way of reproducing food residues "," noted Ziegelman, as cooks were able to hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely serrated luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"strange mixtures were tried, because a calorie rich and nutritious satisfaction rang in flavor or even healthy kitchen."</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandhai: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-sharks usually come only in winter to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after an examination, this Hai was allowed to return to the sea after an examination."</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with well a 1 km / h through North Atlantic - to the present day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland hay only comes with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Greenland-shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes average just 1,220 meters."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a rich 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, characterized by slowness, seems to be a panacea for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science "at any rate from a Greenland-shark, which could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," Alexander Scheuerlein comments from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"admittedly, the evolutionary biologist prefers that Greenland haie become stony."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland-sharks are difficult to observe, after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland hay.</seg>
<seg id="17">"their time-pentagons are called them, when they equip six animals with a transmitter before Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="18">"prey make this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the polar sea and look for cadaver that torches from higher water layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Greenland-sharks, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as a bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the biggest 502 centimeters measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth, therefore, should lie after the early 1960s, as atomic weapons testing large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters length, on the other hand, the lens nucleus contained a low excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday during his investigation in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all larger Greenland-hay, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 quantities in its lenticular nucleus, which arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock for a 493 centimeter long Greenland showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might even be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Grönlandhai-females only get offspring, if they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers were able to assign an age to the length."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold to sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland haie with the multiplication obviously leaves at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live above all in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 year old Grönlandwal, whose bacon at the neck reached a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often also runs on a sparing flame."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature then - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often very big."</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very big animal should, on the other hand, invest its resources in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">"thus, the city on the Main has the best chances to attract jobs and companies from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg."</seg>
<seg id="3">"it is very likely that Frankfurt is most benefiting from the Brexit-Votum," says Michael Voigtländer, Head of the Department of Expertise for Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the IW. "</seg>

<seg id="10">"in Paris, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB."</seg>

<seg id="16">"in addition, the rents for first-class commercial real estate cars are 50 percent higher than on the River Main."</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on their way on a four-day pilgrimage of Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"together, four stages were dealt with."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the time until the next round trip of all ministers in two years, the Oberministrant Tour St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a several-day pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="5">"several pilgrimage destinations have been examined and finally decided for the bishop's city of Freiburg, where in this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the opened gate of mercy on the Freiburg Muenster, a special pilgrimage destination was offered."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern were on the way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening before, pastors sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim's crosses and parted the pilgrimage route."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb it was taken by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Münster-Our Lady stands and so the Pilgrimage was taken from the Muenster."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening, accompanied by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and texts."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but also on the way, the Minis on cross-crosses, chapels or churches always went back to sing a song from a specially assembled pilgrim song."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for the nights, parishes of the local parishes were available."</seg>
<seg id="12">"at the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller cared for a tasty, also strengthening dinner and breakfast."</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we continued via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">"after that, one stepped on stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous stretch of road, at first we had to climb about 500 metres in altitude and then climbed again."</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the lake in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning pulse on the fourth pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter it went to the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">"visibly facilitated and happy, the Minis arrived at the Freiburg cathedral later in the afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy."</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse here God was given thanks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Minis by Kooperator Markus Obert were welcomed at the evening mass in Münster.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men team sprint in the velodrome in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role, which his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made himself Eigen. the young boy made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a victory from the favorites New Zealand."</seg>
<seg id="4">"England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy claimed the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick after being in March at the World Championships in London, despite the withdrawal of Hoys, only a modest sixth place."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie's staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a one.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement created a gap which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they remained as they saw potential in the Scots that unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy prevailed - and Skinner placed an Olympic board in the Qualification Round, but in the standard rounds the New Zealand won in the first lap."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Hinder fell short after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a large part of the transformation in which Hinder drove in a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell down Skinner, Kenny and Hinder, when they stepped onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the final round we set up an olympic board and defeated the world champions.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph of 2012 on the Kennys and Hoys page, there was evidence that after a weak start he intentionally dropped off the train."</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such a problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"said:" "it feels like London's entire UK flags at the tribune."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team for the past three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have been so badly away with so many world titles that it was incredible to win at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if that is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the form of Kennys, it is in the realm of the possible that he repeated Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part next in the Sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "I enjoy this only for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," If he wins two more gold medals, he should become a knight. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal race of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four-four odometer races."</seg>
<seg id="39">They came to the finish in 3: 51,942. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"the World Record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wiggins are focusing on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">"he had argued yesterday with commissioners before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his body size."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women competition, which will be continued tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World Records in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team is relying on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a pair of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"it played drama in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the middle of Sexisiting and Mobbingvorwürfen as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks like that the now legendary GBs, who has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the smelting of Portland due to the lifting of the energy contract questionable</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria, as well as hundreds of workstations of workers, are at stake, as the system operator announces the energy supply contract and thus will lift all supply contracts, such as the supplying energy company."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step was followed by the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 workstations in the Alcoa facility in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 workstations - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effects as the melting shop consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa completed the Point Henry melting shop, which last year led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, initially as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting shop with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, whereby the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity by the melting shop," said the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts should be so-called" "hedging transactions", "which should have entered into force in November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the contracts have a 12-month notice period, so that they will end in 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"hence, AGL assumes that the contracts in the fiscal year 17 will contribute to revenues," "said the electricity supplier."</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on the income on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"AGL said that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual revenue of $187 million in" "expectation of a termination". ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to negotiate the contracts, the" ability Alcoas... to operate the melt, or to ensure the electricity supply to the melt "is not affected."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said that 2010 signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which would have entered into force from November this year even if there is still one explanation of why it has resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the industry's poor economic conditions prior to the possible closure of the Portland melting shop in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland had some 600 megawatts and a total of around 900 megawatts of electricity per year."</seg>
<seg id="23">"should both systems disappear from the market, that would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generator would not be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder, and ran at the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on their Instagram account on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight brought me to cry," "Kendall wrote."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), saved reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn) as they forget the cover of their sister and that ends with a classical turn: they all have a surprise party planned."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this represents the clichéed action almost every birthday sepisode of a children's program (Seacrest brought the sentence," "You thought we had forgotten you?" "with the honesty of a cartoon at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to leave her other girls somehow on this Publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September edition of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians started with certainty."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim likes to see what the vogue cover is concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most widely sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference, which rather resembles an illustrated book as a fashion magazine, the issue pulls a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista used by the 832 pages of the developer 615 pages advertisement)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover stars is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years images of the magazine reviewed yet before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years, there were clearly more" celebrities, modeln "as" models that are celebrities "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar-Prize Winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour."</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the low chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teens of today who know how to shoot a good snapchat video (even if it applies to all of them).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenners like success not everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with its reality TV history, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-Modell Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called them "the bustle of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings boiled up again when the message came out with the appearance of Yenners on the vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But moving around on the mismess seems to pass by at the point.</seg>

<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, so it was not well in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was rather knock."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would today range for approximately two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now shipped with a minimum of 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the" Nokia 9000 Communicator "came to the stores exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few Euro fans can buy the devices still on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as an "office in the west pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards: SMS and e-mails were sent and received, even by fax the communicator could be reached."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers, albeit slow."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be worked like a laptop."</seg>
<seg id="17">Then they found a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price was rather proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. approx. 1400 euro."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No-one could suspect in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">"since then, everything is different."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me it was the biggest attraction Heathrow, just like in 2012 in London, when we ran a big effort to ensure that all our nations and regions were benefiting from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities, we are already offering 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and bring an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead in London 2012, there will be those who think that the challenge of expansion Heathrows is too great."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blinded on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters had wronged in 2012 and they will also lie wrongly at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in sweating growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment in both the airport and the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have implemented a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion investment investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - the five years in a row to the world's best airport terminal until the T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequented runways in the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third track, which is backed by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">London's games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabited."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could have revealed ground-like conditions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly spun."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lit the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate lives and protected from rapid evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent more.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus will expose her day's side to the sun for almost two months," said GISS Scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the sun's heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously thought by planets research.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was presumably habitable, Venus was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billions years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogene, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect - Venus, as we know it today."</seg>

<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star enhancements, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," "said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release."</seg>

<seg id="5">"Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems."</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to redeeming ransom is significantly higher than in private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying fast evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes leader Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most paintings were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered the blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in recent months startling fast."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works following a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it searches specifically for recently modified files such as Word-, Excel or Database files as well as for archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and erase the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail presses."</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the end key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin -."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without shut down production."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware fails."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of affected German companies reported revenue losses caused by ransomware, 13 percent even had to complete their business activities completely, in one case, people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany there were already several hospitals offering victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of sick people."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: pay not, you only support the problem," "explains Kleczynski."</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the claim by the perpetrators in the face of stagnation in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure have investigated the usage areas and the contact with the users and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain to their victims via chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, set freely accessible support websites or decrypt free sample files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private people redeem for payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more professional and share their work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus supplier Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware about within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that it is three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware in the form of a software building kit to the actual extortions.</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evenings you roll yourself eternally, at night you are hours awake, in the morning it is far from the wake-ring no longer think of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is with such problems in good society: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How are sleeping problems or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there may be diverse reasons for them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for sleep-up and sleep medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the insomnia, therefore, is an entry and dormant disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in particular, many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">Sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early waking is common especially for depression," "says Weeß."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors dampen one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who, for example, has a disc failure, can be bad, wake up every two to three hours and possibly begin to ponder on everyday problems and worry, adds an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to a doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who does not sleep well over a period of one month at least three nights per week and is impaired on the day should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment can look quite different: one is downcast, tired, unhealthy, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquestion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"there is hardly any vacant sleep medicine in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary care centre at the Charité University Medicine Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, you should first contact the doctor in case of sleeping problems."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be clarified with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep or what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">"for an examination in the sleep laboratory, physicians, for instance, advise for snoring with breathing difficulties, in abnormal fatigue, in sleepwalkers or if one does not find the cause of a dormant disorder, explains Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nap," "says Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the wiring, one goes into the bed at its normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera records the sleeping-end on the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a few adjusting screws on which you can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"wether counts on: regular sleep and rise times, not too long in bed, on the day do not sleep, do not watch TV for sleeping, avoid alcoholic and don't look at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and this is quite and not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="1">"old buildings, a few linden trees, in between still a rest cobblestone pavement: the Rīga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like that, but the police is one of the" dangerous places "of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2">"walking along the street from east to west, you come to playgrounds, a newly-painted Kindergarten and a Bioladen."</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone "ugly!" sprayed at the facade of a gray house.</seg>
<seg id="4">"opposite a Lidl, who is to be torn down soon, it is already built: until 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in recent weeks, articles about this trendy district, such as the responsible property company Friedrichshain, are preferred by burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the occupants have rent contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel has expressed himself repeatedly for a hard action by the police against the project, the area called" No-Go-Zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were cleared, the police patrolled out official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors to enter the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile renovated building workers commissioned by the unknown landowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin administration court decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers moved under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon, the street is peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the house projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main concerns of many people: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana *, who runs three children here, are generally generated by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the residents of the house projects, they share the concerns of increasing rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it does not sound like a Kiez, who wanted a majority of police protections from the vandal."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin inner senator and the police between house owners and their neighbors make up, evidently does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in eastern Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which has a low average age and high poverty reduction even today compared to the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße close to the Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been evacuated under a large police force in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rīga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, in recent years, the district has become a magnet for tourists and pollers from all over the world. now residents of GDR times and former homeowners share their Kiez."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also noticeable in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them on designed discs or newly painted facades that were ejected using paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"no other street was mentioned this year together with the words" "left-autonomous violence". ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason for not all neighbours to view this as a problem could be that they are not affected by criminality: crimes like bodily harm are, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the offences make material damage, which tends to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenant beside the controversial 94 for 17 years, uncertainty cannot be a question of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who were not sure."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the famous burning cars, too, are no longer in the Rīga anymore."</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer consciously moved into the Rīga - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"that is why it was so important that the local residents got their road back: from the police, politics and the media, all of which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city beyond the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neugebauer, the street continues to be taken away: through faceless new buildings in former bridges, which displaces the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"finally, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so well-affected," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="34">"I cannot approve violence and destruction." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone never listens to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">"frustration arises on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for trainees who are freeing about colour bombs: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">"who pulls, should be aware of it - just like someone who moves to a pub neighborhood, can complain badly about noise there."</seg>

<seg id="8">"in such a way, some - less deriving but rather on the multitude of requesting areas of responsibility - meant, when the administration wanted to write the job."</seg>
<seg id="9">"a management specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, was chosen to be an insane wool melee sau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"administrative work is not its central area," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it concerns organisation, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">Firm of the Year for Private Construction Luther Firm of the Year for Energy</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the Wasenstrasse</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find homes for the connecting flights that have been acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must teach the refugees in their own or rented premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the communes themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Federal Council Office to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, the administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far it was not working, if one relies on private apartments, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common flats must be approved as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine Customers and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a permanent residence, internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and support activities for refugees and migrants are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine client. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house master, do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat, as reported by Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment". ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day takes a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so there are offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So you also jump here administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must explain to the refugees that it will take time and can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"whoever will develop the feeling, he could not help anyone in Urbach, should not work and be useless, he will never be integrated."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are problems, too, says customer honestly," "people who do nothing at all." "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">That's all a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two after the recent occurrences fear radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine client quite clearly, "what some people might call naive." a residual risk can and may not exclude them. "</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins could completely call them back.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine client. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">Therefore main and volunteers must look for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always been in the background that a new shock to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics abhors itself."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it's unfair to put them on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived yet where we want to go," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would relax the situation."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher is already busy with it, so that the previous people can be integrated sensibly."</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently approximately 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
