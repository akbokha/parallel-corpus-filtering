Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as T@@ ehr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ sing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critici@@ zes the ongoing settlement of Israel and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu a lack of will in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal of Obama &apos;s deal about Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the U.S. Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken by Obama , a meeting had rejected this election in Israel with reference to the time im@@ min@@ ent . &quot;
in an emergency call professor advised to have shot his girl@@ friend
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who was in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Mississi@@ ppi , had already made 300 miles to the school territory , where he killed and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Political leader Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff members have heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; a day after shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have a history of violence or criminal pre @-@ history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself mentioned in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose teaching staff includes 17 members , and many students visited courses from both . &quot;
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers who praised the Lamb , said he also seemed a bit excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to leave for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
&quot; this year , he taught only two online courses . &quot;
&quot; recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ for@@ ge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after escape from the campus , the police later found a Lam@@ bs track when he went back to Mississi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb was killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 , Lamb started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and education . &quot;
he did his doc@@ torate in the spring of Pe@@ da@@ gog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing girl@@ friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met through common friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool elderly guy who tried to teach her the guitar a few years . &quot;
at that time he was the wom@@ ens &quot; flock .
&quot; all the girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s Jackson city of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss obviously had some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no document of marriage . &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house that ad@@ joins a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and blues playing . &quot;
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail were both coming up in a summer fair three years ago .
later they played one or two gig together .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 of September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth harmon@@ ica in front of a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were in the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of sc@@ iss@@ ors .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening around 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including instructors , staff , students and members of the congregation in a candle light ceremony . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the ma@@ dness , while the university professor &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to return our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Mississi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency calls Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
toys R Us plans to hire less workers for the Christmas season
toys R Us says that it will not be so many Christmas season employees like last year but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
&quot; the company said that it was planning to employ 40,000 people in shops and distribution centres throughout the country . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with application interviews this month and the number of employees from October to December is increasing .
&quot; while the holidays themselves are still months away , the Christmas business is getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equi@@ p stores with employees who sell , send and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox jo@@ king over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater for the ro@@ y@@ als and I notice that the seat is empty beside me , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated iron and a arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; back for the Future &quot; &quot; had a premiere 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; un@@ disp@@ uted the biggest time @-@ travel movie that has ever been filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cin@@ em@@ as in October . &quot;
&quot; UN chief says , there is no military solution in Syria &quot;
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says , his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year @-@ long conflict , and more weapons will make violence and misery for millions of people only . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief again calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he de@@ pl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
ban asked the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in order to cope with the crisis in Syria that they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
survey data showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as flop .
others have dismis@@ sed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a break .
&quot; but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans attempt to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper circles in p@@ olls , it did not work . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will likely win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership was given to the ascending Her@@ man C@@ ain in 2011 , none of whom did not win only one state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now see m@@ umps per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey data indicating that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
umps have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positive . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have negative opinions .
and these figures stand in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans said they would either be &quot; &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two out of ten say they were &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; when he was the candidate . &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they &quot; dis@@ cont@@ ented &quot; or &quot; off@@ ended &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the Favorit of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans don &apos;t see m@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive comments , 52 percent of the Irish voters who have been defending the rep@@ ublic@@ ans believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is considered in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his ministry , and almost six out of ten independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament does not p@@ asse into the White House , ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they set up their guard @-@ guard , republi@@ can voters stop Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who is most likely the GO@@ P nom@@ ination wins , after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change from the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb bush .
full disclosure : in the past GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at that time in the last cycle four out of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination to only 28 % for the final Candi@@ date Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
yet it is clear that a large number of GO@@ P voters look at the campaign as plau@@ sible .
&quot; even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump strikes almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to m@@ umps , while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ at @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump has re@@ aped the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ der and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their opinion .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have fixed their votes .
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can truly say , never change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , tr@@ umps is the strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign two months ago , immigrants from Mexico called &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; , &quot; the immigration of pi@@ vot@@ al and pi@@ vot@@ al in public discourse in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic way from Tr@@ ump brings decisive His@@ p@@ ano @-@ Americans away from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts . &quot;
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post @-@ Survey of Monday , six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; so long as immigration remains in the lim@@ el@@ ight , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do it too . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , meanwhile , account for about half the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider to be someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated about the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hel@@ lish . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sylt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ look@@ en@@ weg there is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the Nord@@ se@@ ew@@ att .
&quot; in the street , one square metre of a roof @-@ roof@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euro . &quot;
&quot; on Sylt , the range of objects is limited by nature , &quot; it says in the study - that is why the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special locations a square meter costs the most .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student book in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential locations , however , one of the price occurs like pe@@ anu@@ ts . &quot;
the Real Estate Service Provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euros per square meter , well @-@ marked . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
&quot; by the way : Munich , for an exception , is not at the top . &quot;
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Gö@@ tze
double keeper in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has a run .
&quot; a happy hit by Thomas Müller took the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ raeus , and then it ran . &quot;
a confident kick @-@ off of the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tze ste@@ ered a dream start into the &quot; &quot; Mission of Milan &quot; &quot; in the witch @-@ bo@@ ilers of Pir@@ äus in the witch @-@ bo@@ ilers of Pir@@ äus . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 51 . / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hits ( 89 . ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth victory in the series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola will finally fetch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run . &quot;
&quot; in his 28th matches in the Champions League , Müller was awarded the winning help of Olympi@@ ak@@ os Tor@@ wart , Roberto , who suffered a shot of the world champion &apos;s thought as a flan@@ k . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ Kap@@ itän Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31,@@ 6@@ 88 hot@@ ter fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without sh@@ outing .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his youngest six home games in the royal league , including famous clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but the Bav@@ arians , in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went to work courage@@ ously , but with their offensive efforts often too imagin@@ ative to works . &quot;
the attacks were often initiated by means of a deposit on the left side Douglas Costa which rarely came through against the former O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i from the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k hit from the right half @-@ field in the left upper tar@@ piece .
in the 6@@ 7. minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown beat the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct pickup the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was on his knees ( 35 . ) .
&quot; although the Bavaria reg@@ a@@ ined its usual domin@@ ance game , Pir@@ äus was able to place needle @-@ pins . &quot;
but Manuel Neu@@ er was on door@@ ke@@ epers .
&quot; in such a way , when he drew a shot from Ide@@ ye to the Lat@@ te ( 52 . ) . &quot;
&quot; before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center near Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng defending it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Gö@@ tze , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , initially sat outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero has only given the green light after the final training , &quot; said Sports Director Matthias Sam@@ pler on &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; if you want to make something different from it , this is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he gave King@@ s@@ ley Com@@ an for the an@@ ted Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
Gö@@ tze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later .
in front of the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly i@@ verm@@ ist Bayern fans in their audience block evi@@ dently prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts Pir@@ äus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with pun@@ ches against the Munich tra@@ ilers . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes has a higher risk of losing teeth
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs but also the teeth - that suggests a long @-@ term study . &quot;
&quot; good news : in case of wai@@ ver , the risk is reduced rapidly . &quot;
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in smo@@ kers compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely increased to 2.5@@ - to 3.6 cm . &quot;
the scientists had observed over 23,@@ 300 participants . &quot;
&quot; root causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , acc@@ entu@@ ates the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor , acc@@ entu@@ ate the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gum infections in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , write the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the haz@@ ard sin@@ ks back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , explains Er@@ stau@@ gate Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained study leader H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking dimin@@ ishes life time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lung and vessels , and according to our findings also leads to good dental health to the age of age . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth failure .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
archae@@ ologists come across from the banks of Cologne on rem@@ n@@ ants from the late antique
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological finds were found on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historic buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called ground monuments . &quot;
&quot; for all building projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as a department for archaeological soil conservation . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the Rhine @-@ bou@@ lev@@ ards , the archae@@ ologists were now five . &quot;
&quot; from text documents , it has already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , Trier explained . &quot;
&quot; in addition to rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with some 350 gra@@ ves was discovered that probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman captured by freight train
&quot; after a young woman arrived at the station in a mis@@ erable mis@@ si@@ les @-@ liner , the Federal Police asked the population for help . &quot;
&quot; at the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 clock the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the platform , and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; by the acquisition of the train , it has borne serious injuries to the Federal Police . &quot;
it was treated by emergency medical doctors and brought to hospital by emergency workers .
on the basis of the ni@@ ghtly gli@@ de crossing of the young woman there are no evidence of the middle @-@ middle officials .
the incident might have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
&quot; local residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by from Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Zi@@ egel@@ b@@ ä@@ cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) come into question . &quot;

European Commission proposes new court in dispute over T@@ TIP
&quot; in order to def@@ use the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Free Trade Agreement ( T@@ TIP ) , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states are to be replaced by a more transparent system which clearly corresponds to more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; stated Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström . &quot;
the Swe@@ de proposes to bring the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
T@@ TIP is to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely fores@@ ee that the EU states and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
a second instance is scheduled for the first time .
it would allow it to appeal against preju@@ di@@ ces .
&quot; up to now , the involved parties agreed among themselves to arbit@@ rators , a possibility of obj@@ ection to their judgments . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and fair@@ ness , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it intends to work on an International Investment Court according to its own specifications . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied there . &quot;
the Investor @-@ Sta@@ ats arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) of large corporations is regarded as one of the main reasons for the big resistance in Europe against T@@ TIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , over which companies op@@ press damages to the tax@@ pa@@ yers , raise national laws , or cut down a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first responses , anti @-@ T@@ TIP organizations such as Camp@@ act referred to the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot;
it was especially critic@@ ised that they should not apply for the already negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; the German economic state Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance . &quot;
&quot; the Commission considered essential points in the reform , the Federal Minister of Economics signed by Sig@@ mar Gabriel in the spring with other EU Trade Ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the action of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the T@@ TIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remains uncle@@ ar on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since the middle of 2013 .

&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer valid .
del@@ ectable folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ d acting singer @-@ singer filmed the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captiv@@ ated by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells of various places he always records on the map , what his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and tender arranged songs report . &quot;
&quot; where they were born and how it looks there , in his homeland . &quot;
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderfully creative Irish . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State , &quot; kl@@ ug composed songs that narrow@@ ly narrow@@ ly to American folk in the late six@@ ties but can always drift into the great op@@ ul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; Michigan , &quot; would be the first part of a we@@ aving series : each of the 50 US states should be followed . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive outlook . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live enough for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later the musician from New York returns to the series .
&quot; with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Hel@@ oise &quot; ) , a nationwide famous masterpiece appears in 2005 . &quot;
over@@ crow@@ ding ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any annual list of influential music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens will then be using &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic replacement parts . &quot;
&quot; this sixth decent studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; far from the smaller clubs , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluor@@ escent stage de@@ ko . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .
in the glo@@ om@@ ily held ham@@ burger More !
&quot; he is mainly presenting the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although nearly 2,000 guests now sit in their chairs , the much more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without direc@@ ting a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
&quot; from the audience one h@@ ears : the lecture is &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and one can thus throw away the &quot; &quot; plate &quot; . &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s frac@@ tion@@ als
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut will be awa@@ ited with tension at the Prime Minister &apos;s findings . &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is to give his debut at the prime minister &apos;s frac@@ tion@@ als and for the first time put on David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to provide the first of his six questions shortly after lunch and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs out of the area .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary sc@@ rut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision , on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them , has prov@@ oked a commem@@ oration of the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ising a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands at the center of several news stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision to not sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokes@@ man said he had &quot; &quot; stood in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns shadow kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are called on differences in economics , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
the political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t states that political differences are also st@@ acking within Labour and according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation with profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes lay in order to remove the whole idea of a constra@@ int altogether .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow working and pensions Minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he &apos;s T@@ ory CEO facing the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament over the last decade .
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised another policy approach , says that he has ideas on Mr Cameron &apos;s &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas and gave him more than 30,000 imp@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP said that the Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tion@@ na@@ ire is too con@@ front and that he will refra@@ in from having both &quot; striking &quot; and the stri@@ fe with ad@@ vers@@ aries , and has decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality , and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Angela Eagle that the shadow of economic ministers will represent him if he does not take part - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
&quot; he also brought the idea into a conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the House , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre , &quot; which is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ ings . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television first in 1990 , the prime minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that she has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needs far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pounds increase through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound jump@@ ed down to data , which showed an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller &apos;s goal . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.9 % compared to the same period of the previous year . &quot;
this percentage has been the fastest and raised estim@@ ation of the time of interest in interest since 2009 .
&quot; the pound increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was reduced to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to € 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a 20 % jump after acquisition of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore &apos;s shares rose by 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion US $ by a stock sale as part of his debt reduction strategy .
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his appreciation for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot;
JD Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports@@ wear company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the head of JD Sports says higher wages je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze expansion .
the managing director of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; could mean more purchasing power in bags of potential buyers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will balance the higher labour costs at his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot;

PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings the Leban@@ ese to the idea of m@@ ush
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
&quot; both - and in the potato @-@ twe@@ eter , which the Oldenburg i@@ vory @-@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the phrase &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ ha@@ y Pot@@ ato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Peg@@ ida demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; , &quot; which he had seen random@@ ly on TV . &quot;
&quot; since then , a grill sk@@ ewer is rotating in its shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is multic@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot;
the idea has meanwhile changed the Leban@@ ese office at the Patent Office in Munich .
&quot; according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility model . &quot;
&quot; how much meat and how many potatoes in the sk@@ ewer contain , Al@@ ha@@ y doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y them . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; he finds . &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Met@@ cash starts Anti @-@ di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea &quot; &quot; campaign to fight against al@@ di@@ - &quot;
met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA stores in front of an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
&quot; food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a floor management campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia , ahead of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion . &quot;
&quot; during Al@@ di &apos;s opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets are strengthening ties with local food vendors and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough distributed in I@@ GA stores samples and shop@@ ke@@ epers who sell approved tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ og@@ s will publish more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices carries out its annual Investor @-@ Strateg@@ i@@ et@@ ag . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot on the game , since South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher margins as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ orious provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to roughly 14 percent in Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and taking away all available actors , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and cash 250 million $ by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and 600 million $ in each market .
&quot; the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the market shares in Eastern states are losing mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , despite a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will fall in food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and to reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business lunch in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ z refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 , i@@ Gas market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which is approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects the debt reduction in simultaneous pressure on revenues and margins . &quot;
&quot; however , the wholes@@ aler pays off and inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ to align selling prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week and to provide I@@ GA retailers in order to improve their stores through faster @-@ growing fresh foods and to provide a better choice of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging san@@ iti@@ zation programs are to be increased , hoping that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in 2017 for the first time in 2017 . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behaviour in the view of the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight by the not@@ orious dispute between Cy@@ ril and St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon thereafter , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , and Har@@ rison exc@@ laimed , &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was recently watched as he defeated a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp@@ f wart@@ ed a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is von He@@ aly def@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing that I am quite ready for is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was dra@@ fted a little into the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a cr@@ amp , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was a little too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is good in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider Kyr@@ gios on the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday and describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but it sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed part to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all around the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; and I think Nick quickly made ascen@@ sion to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares state of emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
&quot; Hungary declared the emergency , and dominated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to come out illeg@@ ally into the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , when hundreds of migrants began to accum@@ ulate in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted ser@@ bian civil servants . &quot;
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip along the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
but fru@@ strations climbed .
&quot; as a police helicop@@ ter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; opened the border ! &quot; and cried ins@@ ults against the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some have returned from protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister stated that it was &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would send back more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be a part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; discussions with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ences at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ blo@@ c at a controversial meeting in Brussels could not agree on common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the over@@ crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would receive more 120,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent . &quot;
&quot; but Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a prompt action from Brussels or its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; the emergency response rested on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authority more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures . &quot;
Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country plan to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after it has ended a fence along the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even jail races were deployed in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most incoming business refugees are seeking a better life , and not war refugees who claim protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which entered into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also set higher sentences for convic@@ ted traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares state emergency , &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs Repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country . &quot;
they come over by dam@@ aging the fence ; they are now in police custo@@ dy and are accused of the b@@ ang@@ ing of crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surrounded the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and press a crowd to drive there . &quot;
&quot; some 20 managed to enter , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s former Secretary of State remains a two @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins over against the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he candidates for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more than one of the other candidates in their choice .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders posted some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton keeps a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these proj@@ ections have decreased . &quot;
&quot; her support in the men has fallen sharp@@ ly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage with democratic voters under 50 years has evap@@ or@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , still has a big advantage in older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters of the local elections would say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some precau@@ tions and further 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are excited above all by her .
the views are more mixed with those who don &apos;t currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters in the pres@@ election say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it is the candidate , the most common answer is that she is the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
our consent to dealing with the problems and the constitu@@ ency are also quoted .
&quot; as the Vice @-@ President th@@ rows a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked for elections , who would be their second choice for the party is Bi@@ den at the head . &quot;
Clin@@ tons of supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders .
&quot; if bi@@ ds are not decided to channel for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage increases before S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the elections ; however , this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; be@@ aver is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; has increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , with the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call for questions about the elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; similarly , like last month , no single democratic candidate or candidate for these elec@@ tors considered un@@ acceptable to these elec@@ tors . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important features among voters in the pre @-@ elections of their party .
&quot; maj@@ orities look at Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; for the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cutting off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of the voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many people say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters in the elections generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ds ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic vot@@ er has no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; having questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term as a foreign minister , most of the Democratic voters of the pres@@ election are happy with their explanation of the matter and say it has not affected their opinions in total . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation while only about one third is satisfied .
&quot; the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans have said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinions , although 36 percent said that their opinion had deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views from Clinton become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters . only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 per cent of the eligible voters do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible voters nationwide also see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good marks in leadership . &quot;
&quot; among the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best cut by hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic elec@@ tors in the previous sel@@ ections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son arrives at the nationwide survey near Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . the support is growing by 23 % in the last week of C@@ BS , which was conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey on Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son was well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passed Tr@@ ump from Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ der , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ in Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is the deepest , and 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Florida governor J@@ eb Bush , the former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are 6 % on the third place . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son is rising in the surveys - he lands with 19 % support in the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post also revealed Tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view to a Car@@ son rising during the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question the tr@@ umps of faith . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathroom temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean Sea is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even when peak values are measured only remotely , a trip to the Mediterranean Sea is sufficient for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find warm water . &quot;
a bath in the north or Baltic sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; there is no shortage of water in the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , divi@@ des the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , bath temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the East it is even up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five persons . &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ br@@ otherhood arrested Ch@@ un &apos;@@ Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital which contributed to his death .
&quot; officials said he had been loaded with a 30 pound ruck@@ sack full of sand with connected eyes , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a goal . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si br@@ otherhood called not the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was fa@@ inted and suppos@@ edly waited one hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gling its symptoms , and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the President of the br@@ otherhood , said President Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide the utensils and set the well @-@ being of the br@@ otherhood about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning at his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt strength injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died of the ch@@ ik@@ anen since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; fr@@ at@@ ernity and its members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
&quot; a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for murder of third grade , for the first five members . &quot;
&quot; two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic attacks and formation of a criminal community . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the village group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a rate of interest is coming , and the house will be moved , Ren@@ di@@ tes for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we do not know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance to the process . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and took 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in the way the economy and financial investments respond . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives from the U.S. Central Bank have so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates but rather on the period required for norm@@ alisation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , market participants could see that the whole excitement could possibly be exagger@@ ated because of a interest rate . &quot;
&quot; the first increase of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions . &quot;
&quot; here , a look at historic trends is based on how some sectors of the economy could react : &quot;
&quot; as the market has seen last month , anticip@@ ation of interest income can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets will be seas@@ oned for 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study to what happened after interest rates of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market is generally down@@ ward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest income , rather flat in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a current analysis , which published Bob D@@ oll , CEO facility strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interest rates often encourage them .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed confron@@ ts some conditions that it did not exist before and that could accelerate the recession . &quot;
it is particularly not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate of interest of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , there was only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect that this will continue and anticip@@ ate only 1.5 percent for the third quarter of Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and the question arises , &quot; If this time is different , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; market participants have set themselves on a interest rate of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were focused on meeting the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade gives only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all increases cycles from 1950 to now have taken place in a super cycle with increasing GDP in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ essi@@ onal heights are put into the shade very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months until now . &quot;
firm income was also volati@@ le because the market anticipated interest income and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that bonds are faster than when stocks change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
&quot; at the end of the increase cycle , the bond companies immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the strateg@@ ists of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will result in the fact that returns between longer and shorter bonds bring closer together , and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often result in better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones is thinking that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve is flat , loan contrac@@ tions have expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and whole , companies that deal with the greater part of their business activities in the US will benefit if interest rates increase and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debt will get worse , as a growing dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and the financing of their debt as well . &quot;
&quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after initial interest income , &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed companies with weak balance after each of the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity for their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the majority , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure equity , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; saver may see profits through higher yields , even if experts of different opinion are how fast this will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Members of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
the Conserv@@ ative Member of Parliament critici@@ zed the transmitter for its &quot; di@@ mm@@ ing &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also tou@@ red the BBC Music Awards and said that they im@@ it@@ ated only The Br@@ its
Parliament Col@@ lins Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked up The Voice and said it was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; converts &quot; to Classic FM , cla@@ iming a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the broad@@ ca@@ ster to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not . &quot;
&quot; Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public legal radio station &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distinguish from its commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; dim &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also tou@@ red the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontane@@ ously named examples , where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC General Director with@@ drew the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will not learn from classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is really un@@ matched .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works , I think it &apos;s important , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey ar@@ gues that tough@@ er efforts must be made to engage audiences as it did in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC &apos;s production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sports were under fire to hit the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins handle The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased from the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of € 22 million . &quot;
&quot; do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall also insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC manner .
&quot; he added , he wants the company to find &quot; a hit from our in @-@ house stable , &quot; when it &apos;s next time a series of entertainment star@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money from fee payments for other entertainment formats . &quot;

* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the recordings began in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday broke the issues in November
&quot; for more than a decade , the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; when you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , that has always been developed over time , &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth decreases . &quot;
the black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decl@@ ining sales .
&quot; experts believe that buyers with@@ hold their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday of November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites rus@@ hed off . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , where buyers fight for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from doing purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium produced that 5 £ expenditure was spent a little more than £ 1 online .
&quot; for some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now done via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca near the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first fun@@ er@@ als in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia det@@ ains the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Ben Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane rus@@ hed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the victims killed when a crane in Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ cha collap@@ sed .
&quot; mour@@ ners filled , largely dressed in white , the route to give their respect , when the first of the dead approached their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ on@@ th C@@ emetery . &quot;
&quot; the fun@@ eral proc@@ ession moved on to the Holy Place where only days earlier , a building crane was pl@@ ung@@ ed through the mos@@ que &apos;s ceiling and then onto the praying sides . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were released for the fun@@ eral , when the Saudi king left over the construction company of the Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 injured , a sanc@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 operators , who were killed when a crane rus@@ hed through the Great Central African Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram was from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to serve as the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was at the Grand Mos@@ que with his parents before the start of the annual p@@ add@@ ling .
&quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man , the bin Laden Group , said that the arm of the crane was not supposed to stand as it was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arab version of the decree , published by the State of Saudi Press Agency , said that the bin Laden Group was partly responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency reported this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which rus@@ hed into a courtyard of the Grand Mo@@ j@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims began to gather in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place this month . &quot;
&quot; the bin Laden Group has not published any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ ad@@ ored the group because of not current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surrounded Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ cha as part of the massive construction project managed by the bin Laden Group .
&quot; for decades , the Bin Laden family has been connected to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia and takes over major construction projects . &quot;
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qa@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apost@@ ate son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
&quot; government officials ordered 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to pay to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured . &quot;
other injured will receive half of this amount .

&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new CEO of King@@ fis@@ her who owns the tree @-@ markets chain , said that a large increase in number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , which offer services at low prices , is now obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 further scre@@ w@@ fix shops focusing on craftsmen and close to 60 points of sale of B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten purchase decisions are hit by women .
&quot; at the moment , the men were out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households , who make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there &apos;s still a majority of men working in our stores .
we have to move this stronger towards a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a UK in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also brief@@ ed her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in management positions . &quot;
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team occupied with women including his management and financial officer .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the shops .
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches because of the trend . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two officials of the Austrian Vol@@ leyball Court Viz@@ em@@ ei@@ ster A@@ ich / D@@ ob will have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and deport@@ ation .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he has been legally acqu@@ itted in May . &quot;
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the General Prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , the accused had cryst@@ alli@@ sed in the preliminary investigation , that in 2006 to 2011 , the def@@ end@@ ants were using funds from club accounts , which they could disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports officials are also accused of financial off@@ enses .
&quot; this fact divided the Chair@@ person of the Sch@@ öff@@ el@@ sen@@ ate , Jud@@ ge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
&quot; to the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence represented that the association was at no time a piece of an asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports officials were charged only expenses and the sports club , for which it had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from debt - the passi@@ va amounted to approximately 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 44.@@ 000 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we were facing the situation : do we carry on or block the club ? &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the bread@@ form of large @-@ scale audi@@ tors of the financial office . &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have shot money , laid down our life insurance as security in the bank , &quot; &quot; he said in the arrest . &quot;
&quot; it has been agreed with the association : you can freely manage the money , no debt can be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in case of a corresponding financial success , the withdrawal of expenses incurred by the expenses has been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the expenses incurred was paid only years later , namely since 2003 , when a plus was in the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Pau@@ schal@@ - and not detailed desc@@ ents appeared , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and austerity books managed the two def@@ end@@ ants together , the second def@@ end@@ ant said . &quot;
&quot; why the dis@@ bur@@ sements of the association were not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association did not care in detail for the financial result , it was important to have only the freedom of debt , thus the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , an amount of 120,000 euro was transferred to the account . &quot;
&quot; that had been set@@ backs , the def@@ end@@ ants declared . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and , according to the statement , was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; wanted the judge to know . &quot;
wher@@ eu@@ pon the respon@@ dent had no answer for a long time .
&quot; then he said , he believed that this was the best thing for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of that money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant was informed , the function@@ ary justified himself . &quot;
this transfer was formulated as &quot; claims settlement . &quot;
&quot; why in@@ dem@@ nity ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the first def@@ end@@ ant explained that he had not agreed with this wor@@ ding , because the association never had any damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With that you are all out of the tailor . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never received a cent salary , he only reck@@ oned with kilomet@@ re money and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; he charged 1,000 euros per month to di@@ ets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
the def@@ end@@ ants were not able to provide accurate documents for the early years .
&quot; they were no longer kept for a trial , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared . &quot;
kilomet@@ re money also obtained the second def@@ end@@ ant .
&quot; all dwell@@ ings are made in cash , and in addition , from his place of residence , he must go to the Bank to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence , he declared in his statement . &quot;
the main trial will be continued on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard presents another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the ongoing workforce reduction for three years , the computer giant will further develop further jobs when spl@@ itting the company . &quot;
the positions in the US computer giant H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology company plans to reduce the breakdown of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs amoun@@ ting to EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special charge of around $ 2.7 billion , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the mining of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year . &quot;

HP replies with a cle@@ av@@ age and massive sub@@ missions on the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has responded to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and more and more businesses are doing the same online .
&quot; in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans fores@@ ee a total breakdown of around 5@@ 5,000 jobs . &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
&quot; on the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water@@ ways , the Hungarian police deployed several hundred refugees . &quot;
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the erup@@ tion of violence at the border control point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind that a police line was formed and there was a water@@ slide behind the polic@@ emen .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials at first put an un@@ interrupted pepper spray .
then the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drawn a little hes@@ it@@ ant .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees assembled in themselves and suffered under breath .
the press spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries caused by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank
&quot; the world is watching when the US central bank is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of the view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will pers@@ ist a bit longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est sat on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , deputy head of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude view of global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds of such a move are good . &quot;
the decision is scheduled to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
death cap at Delta State University left excuse
&quot; after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Mississi@@ ppi , on Monday morning - and before he later killed his colleagues and killed , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first assass@@ ination and wanted , &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and said he had shot on a man , and a man was killed . &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that police had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller according to his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lamb there was no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police came the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb received 300 miles at Delta State University , where he killed eth@@ ane Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening , when polic@@ emen killed him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ for@@ ge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they were married for about seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends remained . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met for about three years with Lamb . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to always help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , Lamb have inv@@ oked relatives at a certain point of time on Monday to tell them , &quot; He does not go to prison . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen raised him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb sitting on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
Lamb received a doctoral title from the Delta State University in spring 2015 as his life lau on the University &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group restructuring .
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
150 of the 1000 executives around the world will cost the workplace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the pilot union , there is no new negotiation . &quot;
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and adop@@ ts the low @-@ cost Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the aim of the re@@ orientation is an earnings contribution of some 500 million euros a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
the low @-@ cost airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as independent as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the Executive Committee of CEO Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
&quot; with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r emphas@@ ises the importance of Euro@@ wings with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; until now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operated under the Air@@ line Group &apos;s roof , which represents three quarters of annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the collective conflict with the Cock@@ pit ( VC ) Pilot@@ en@@ vereinigung ( VI@@ C ) , the negotiations should be res@@ um@@ ed on this Thursday . &quot;
this divided the union .
the theme of the talks is to be the retirement provision for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result &quot; &quot; cock@@ pit &quot; &quot; may result in a quick@@ est possible outcome . &quot;
the conflict between union and airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the transi@@ tional provision of the pilots , the background is &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa Cargo is moving to the group &apos;s own image @-@ line Euro@@ wings . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United cannot play for months due to double frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Manchester Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
&quot; while this will bring the left outer def@@ ender to the cry and exclude him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al doesn &apos;t hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was lost in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was hospit@@ alized .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then that happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the suspension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , did not pun@@ ish the Mexican . &quot;
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ects that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a mo@@ ve@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account : &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to : Manchester United suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the PS@@ V defeat
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the UK @-@ def@@ ender has an additional incentive to recover until next June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player with this kind of injury leaves the place , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt one opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ As the Netherlands team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball rolling in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad in doing so . I am so sorry .

surely David Cameron doesn &apos;t know The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it almost . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favorite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , published in 1971 , decided by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , as it seems always a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book , instead read an abstra@@ ction of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to expand the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams , having fulfilled her desire to see a real tree , but completely unknown in 1991 . &quot;
&quot; as if it were not yet suspic@@ ious enough : the text presented by Cameron is reading partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he is ad@@ mitting to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , an Un@@ named boy , like the local environment , list@@ ens to the protagon@@ ist , despite the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ering , be@@ aut@@ y@@ ful being , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot; &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row in a row . &quot;
a down@@ ing street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come from Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s election circuit .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons employees , but did not have any further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam E@@ th was clearly threatened by exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ ward victory .
&quot; Ala@@ sta@@ ir C@@ ooks page might be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
related news : Adam Ly@@ th escap@@ es from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ ck@@ et@@ ers are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , as - and I have said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago one would have extended the course of ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny . &quot;
&quot; when he hopefully kno@@ cks further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even if he did not get such good performances and that does not surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
the question how much time a test perc@@ ussi@@ onist receives to set his mark is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton won nine . &quot;
only comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ ward .
the only accus@@ ation that one can rise was that England first used Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance now lies in the past .
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a punch man , whom I charge high . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must receive at least the same chances as those before him , but this naturally depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to beat Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would give an extra @-@ spin Bow@@ ler and get four Qu@@ icks , appeared and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this lef@@ th@@ and has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of Cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ ques may not have done his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team colleague Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred us straight away and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited dealing with him he has impressed me as a young man very impressed . &quot;
people may see their stat@@ s - average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt but there &apos;s no large number of backup sp@@ inners that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the crew , England has made some clever additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
he is one of the nic@@ est not@@ ables of the game that will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all the attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball @-@ ball @-@ phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the previously mentioned . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ i &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used by the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team members do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .

&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ expressed ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to hold great Britain in the EU , even without the election of the in@@ gen@@ ious Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C who fought against Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
aliens also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states , so deeply mired in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always on their own guilt , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing contract changes they usually don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climb on the summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local memorial , with or without local variables , come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , looking for an outside Britain inside the EU camping outside the EU - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets say that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as happened with the exagger@@ ated long expos@@ ures like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and cab@@ bage ( 16 ) . &quot;
France &apos;s François Hollande has a look at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a da@@ zz@@ ling force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist one . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they will tear one leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Brit@@ ons , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s withdrawal from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; so maybe some such ministers even deliberately do not plan helpful comments , entirely in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s speech campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing from value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
Europeans know how often Fle@@ et Street can be on its cost and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press area in 1975 but did not support our 1973 entry with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; they may feel weak to Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro @-@ opportun@@ ists , who made a name as a &quot; &quot; EU Stra@@ in@@ ade Ban@@ ana &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; with all his stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who was his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ acking foreigners and the p@@ seudo @-@ non @-@ foreigners who own most of our large newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about them , but noted that when you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you better ban@@ anas to dist@@ ra@@ ct him instead of being at his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos; refer@@ endu@@ ms , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened to him a back@@ door . &quot;
the press never with@@ drew it from him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly fl@@ aps on my back on Monday - I told him that he no longer need to waste time for me - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ s , a mistake at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it kindly - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ur tendency and the wild ge@@ fil@@ den of Tor@@ y &apos;s Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ man can certainly say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs in him fought not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old , when his old father worked on TV to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said nor what J@@ C told his comrades and dep@@ u@@ ties after all the reports on their clause on Monday evening .
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - news @-@ discipline remains important around the clock in the age of TV and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , which allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the speech campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks of this .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small differences is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities for N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son , fel@@ sen@@ fest is convinced that J@@ C has no campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin turn political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious sel@@ fish@@ ers - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US has already been quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government to power , which I was reminded on Monday of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise report from Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ financed agency that e cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined by critic@@ ising the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
&quot; he published the &quot; &quot; Annual Report &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the load capacity of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind@@ y basis , &quot; &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor for Clinical Prevention at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expected that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 individuals who were called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to conduct their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose directors had previously received an independent study by British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) .
&quot; he also signed the references from BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting agreed to receive funding from an E @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to have received after reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes , some of which also provide a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants in this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the meeting also took part in the tobacco management of p@@ he .
&quot; the group &apos;s research work is characteristic that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most of the criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e cigar@@ ettes were used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at P@@ he said that the alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted . &quot;
he said : &quot; e cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; p@@ he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers relative to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0,000 people annually die from a disease related to smoking and smoking costs two billion pounds per year in the National Health System . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC , to give up East@@ ender , says former boss of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ender and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals hit their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that broadcasting fees should be used only to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , to place in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from transm@@ itters such as BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried to come into contact with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes were commissioned or sent , which were also clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee in his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to keep the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t consider in the medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least get your production on programs that others do not do or commissioned . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax scheme is financed , which could be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ boy is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I try to see how this should be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC &apos;s inno@@ c@@ ence at the hunt for reviews is &quot; &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart day in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows like East@@ ender should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche applications should go to BB@@ C4 , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their apparent Mis@@ sions for justi@@ fying 4 billion pounds of radio charges , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the committee for broadcasting : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here .
&quot; of course you all think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year here , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 per year , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testi@@ fied in front of the committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; &quot; to inform , form and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , little of BBC &apos;s production was now officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example to inform , clarify and enter@@ tain the public television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the pro@@ ms from which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alli@@ ances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change direction at the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment , in which they have sound impulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard . &quot;
&quot; the impulses work by switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are changed gene@@ tically to carry the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m channels , which react to ultrasound waves . &quot;
&quot; for more information on this topic , researchers read and write Brain Activity with Light &quot;
&quot; researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ Genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep @-@ brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread@@ wor@@ ms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion@@ ic channels and found in the membranes of some of the wor@@ ms cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion@@ ic channels and activate the cells they are associated with so a report Nature Communications .
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani Gene@@ tically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels wear . &quot;
&quot; when applying ultrasound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by micro@@ ashes and transferred to the wor@@ ms where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ Genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; unlike light , which must be sent down to the desired position in the brain at an optical fiber , low frequency ultr@@ asonic waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily pr@@ one to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ ous company advertising , but &quot; with the illusion of bright colors and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 year old , I moved into a student residence hall , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have been anno@@ yed - and to the numerous long @-@ heart@@ ed complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed into eight simple rules .
the residen@@ cy in student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly anno@@ ying to absolutely horri@@ fying .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to cry out : people tell wh@@ ence you come , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ yo where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract H@@ AH@@ A@@ HA , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask and show interest .
it direc@@ ts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak even when your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into drinks recep@@ tions , movie night venues and municipal meetings , but they are also places where people attract and their under@@ wear . &quot;
referring to this : do not think to start with a relationship at university
intro@@ vert is given a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ room bo@@ omer@@ ang culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy back , which I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from speed - and send him an SMS instead .
apro@@ pos kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
&quot; since you start the university at the height of Back @-@ Man@@ ie , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to introduce yourself to a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have baked some something . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and at the end may perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent bak@@ er .
&quot; badly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat result in people sleeping when you kno@@ ck . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
&quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of mil@@ let for your tea also ? &quot;
check this with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to use themselves , even when they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my ro@@ ommate , who added a det@@ erg@@ ent to her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make a noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent person , but that you are among the people who are in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if it makes them something to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with still lou@@ der music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she shu@@ ff@@ led her own music , shut her door and went to her three @-@ hour trial . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly enter into the same student residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it would not be deeply embarrass@@ ing if you hold a ro@@ ommate for your future wife , to join her again and then have to see her every day and perhaps experience how she moves all together friends to himself ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has his key in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fine when it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never fail any one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo . &quot;
&quot; close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but do not pack their poss@@ essions on the ceiling more than twice . &quot;
&quot; residen@@ ces for refugees , single educ@@ ators , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ dien@@ er &quot;
the real estate company Markus Gil@@ dner builds town houses for people who don &apos;t have much money in the Francon@@ ian Eck@@ ental row houses .
&quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living room , but also the only educ@@ ative mother and the poor servant . &quot;
&quot; I show how to build good and good today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview &quot;
thousands of refugees are displac@@ ed on the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ der believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr Gill@@ an , many refugees are being pushed to the housing market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people remain to a large extent here .
&quot; in view of the flow of refugees , we need plenty of living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution . &quot;
mer@@ cen@@ aries : a semi @-@ detached house in the least place .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when one puts the people in blocks of living .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers each . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a dining room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say , it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily changed according to the individual needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ ford : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
did the construction regulations complic@@ ate their plans ?
mer@@ cen@@ ary : I have successfully passed my project correctly .
especially complicated it always makes the dro@@ oping D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ nu@@ dis@@ m special construction and the Stell@@ platz@@ 24.@@ de .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still sub@@ du@@ ed , who creates three apartments in a semi @-@ detached house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities is the place lacking .

but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; it is true that we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but they were built luxury apartments that could hardly afford more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the only educ@@ ative mother or the poor @-@ ear@@ ners . &quot;
I would like to show you how to build good and good today .
that &apos;s what it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS if Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app , type in &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; software update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message that tells us that the &quot; software update failed . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush back or try to update over iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean the dele@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made this impro@@ b@@ able through the updating of the update . likewise , it will be easier to do so when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install it as soon as the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worth to ensure that your cell phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone might turn half way down and this could lead to a crash of the update . &quot;

bad Kis@@ singer Chess Club has a prominent member
&quot; the Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; ( Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen ) , which was founded three months ago , has added another member in his series so that the membership count increased to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul Gau@@ sel@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who held over 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to K@@ ur . &quot;
Gau@@ sel@@ mann is the bear@@ er of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the Schach@@ club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported Gau@@ sel@@ mann with a donation which President Alfred Klein met .
&quot; thus it is possible to record chess players , which cannot raise the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent tracking are also to be promoted .
&quot; Gau@@ sel@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; &quot; Rot @-@ Weiß &quot; &quot; is seen as an expression of his connec@@ t@@ edness with the spa town . &quot;
Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ Office seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ est@@ ft have joined together under the man@@ tle of the Social Foundation and opened a new stop at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
&quot; besides consulting , you can also attend courses there . &quot;
the social foundation desc@@ ends from the mountain into the inner city .
more precisely to the count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was opened there .
&quot; here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and coun@@ seling customers receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of health insurance companies . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been working with our ambul@@ ant care service that often nursing relatives are left alone . &quot;
there are infin@@ itely many questions here .
&quot; also , many services of the insurance companies are not in@@ frequently used because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new owner of Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ is@@ ft and the Bürger@@ sp@@ ital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Amadeus . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to consulting , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment can be used . &quot;
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis ideally complement each other .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , fores@@ ight and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the retirement center for care and care , &quot; says Heike Rie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center is seeing both business leaders in particular in demographic change .
this makes a good de@@ centr@@ alised infrastructure indispensable in the individual districts of Bamberg in the future .
&quot; in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also devoted itself to the association in age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the agenda and these invite to a regular con@@ vivi@@ al contribution . &quot;
&quot; thus , the social foundation makes a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar surroundings . &quot;
&quot; the lodging office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. &quot;

&quot; he died on September 5 at the age of 92 , as the artist &apos;s house on Tuesday ha@@ st@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus awarded a honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as was stated in the mission . &quot;
&quot; born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; since 1952 he worked as a freel@@ ance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute director . &quot;
&quot; from 1972 to 1983 , he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design . &quot;
&quot; in the 1980s , he was commissioned to set up the Treas@@ ury in Vienna Hof@@ burg and the renovation of the Palace Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian theatre museum . &quot;

&quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot;

men test on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an
&quot; the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mu@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mu@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , one out of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three people on the grounds of the gas station .
one of these men now cried out to the young people and hit his face with the f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a nos@@ eb@@ and and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left off his victim . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the wounded young man was brought home . &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car to their home and demonstr@@ atively passed there several times .
&quot; when one no longer saw the vehicle , the last one went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
&quot; there , he was again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male person . &quot;
&quot; under the aid of a pitch , one checked on the face and the th@@ ig@@ h of the victim . &quot;
the wounded had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
&quot; until now , only a vag@@ ue t@@ act description has been found . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket was supposed to have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller to take over field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
&quot; the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schw@@ art@@ z and As@@ endor@@ ff mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also delighted . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country doctors - As@@ endorf , on the other hand , are missing luck : there , Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of Fel@@ ce@@ ausen on October 1st . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel &apos;s retirement goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on the side of his successor during the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller again opens the practice on October 12 , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euros at the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first glance , when the Fel@@ lowship begins to meet Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who is currently completing their specialist training in the Ver@@ den hospital and also wants to get into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had the mind that the gar@@ bage would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laugh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I simply ph@@ oned them . &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to operate their own practice in As@@ endorf in future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to meet and accompany families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss . &quot;
and so one agreed that the gar@@ bage sold the house with practice .
they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up there , his medical school in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices and in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; currently he is active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , in addition he was appointed as a leading veter@@ in@@ arian in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is actively involved in the DRC @-@ prepar@@ edness . &quot;
&quot; from September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ce@@ ausen , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) speci@@ alis@@ es in g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the gar@@ bage ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a family doctor . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out therefore , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EK@@ Gs and need a consultation room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a subsi@@ dy of 500@@ 00 euros will receive the gar@@ bage in the framework of a subsi@@ dy programme from the district ( 25,000 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; says Sam@@ t@@ eller mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , approximately 2000 patients come to the practice of Fel@@ ce@@ ausen every quarter , in the north German average practice , it is about 500 . &quot;
in As@@ endorf there is another medical practice .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
&quot; if no successor has been found , she would have gone too . &quot;
&quot; by the way , he who visits Müller &apos;s office hour looks also above all in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; with their f@@ arewell ended in As@@ endorf an era , after all , the doctors have practiced for 30 years there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel says . &quot;
they already feel a little mel@@ anch@@ oly after the long time .
&quot; but we live further in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often &quot; , &quot; says the Intern@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square metre plot . &quot;
&quot; so far I always kept myself from gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and is happy to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also lifted up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; still , it is clear that everyone who wants to make a asylum application can &quot; &quot; naturally &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people are in the foreground .
&quot; but it is clear also that &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , nor on the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia Mov@@ es &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; in this way , however , the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ v@@ dar did not see in Lai@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; however , the border with Croatia is already strongly checked as the outside boundary of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to make its borders for refugees but not abri@@ dged . &quot;
&quot; every member of the EU must fill out his obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already attempted in the night hours to Tuesday to leave in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian Police arrested her in the nearby fields of corn .
&quot; according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly meeting in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country with about 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ oj@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there would be buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously had mig@@ rated migrants to the Hungarian border , diver@@ ging Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was to in@@ struct people to make certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; it was said . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; from Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the occup@@ ants had travelled the whole night away from Serbia around 500 kilometres away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; we heard that Hungary did , so the police said that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
this could indeed lead to a postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat far@@ ther west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister , Ost@@ oj@@ ic previously stressed that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot;
&quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; . &quot; &quot;
perform rigor@@ ous checks to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony to the country since , as far as the standards of border controls are concerned . &quot;
&quot; on Serbian side , about 300 refugees continue to be stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings in Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed completely . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees want to go on to the Croatian border is still uncle@@ ar .
&quot; Wednesday morning , the Serbian Minister of Interior , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic , attempted to calm down on a local eye in Hor@@ gos . he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot;
it would not be a very high rate of refugees .
&quot; one could not say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the bor@@ der@@ line there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot;
Bör@@ sen @-@ H@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars

&quot; with the captured information , Insider transaction is to be made on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; in this way , more than 100 million dollars were launched by the investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison reveals that even those outside our national borders are ultimately captured , &quot; says the SE@@ C communication . &quot;
the trials against 32 other accused were in the event continued .
most of the def@@ end@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators are to have acted in the US and Eastern Europe .

&quot; pul@@ s@@ ating , spr@@ inging life with stunning autumn sun and in the middle of four big tables each with the inscription &quot; Before I die , I want to .... &quot;
&quot; with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice aid made aware of its 20 @-@ year existence and is thoroughly confronted with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the director of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice aid is available to pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as questions and conversations as well as volunteers .
&quot; while a pass@@ ant spontane@@ ously attacks to the chal@@ k and can read the phrase &quot; &quot; my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not endure long &quot; , &quot; others remain short , read , say pro@@ positions like &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again on the ver@@ ge of small discussions about the action itself , about life , how to deal with dying . &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world is coming , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the Director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian Work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ association carrier of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice aid . &quot;
therefore this public @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
&quot; however , that not everyone wants to share on the tables publicly , be understandable , after all , it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; death and dying are still afflic@@ ted with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hosp@@ ice movement in recent years has helped a lot to open people . &quot;

the death and mour@@ ning companion belong to the honorary members of the first hour .
&quot; confronted by personal experience with the topic , she read much literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice aid was looking for volunteers , she immediately reported and was involved in the establishment in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and depend@@ ants in private homes , hospitals , nursing homes , and hosp@@ ice Sankt Vincent . &quot;
all they are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid is able to deal well with her job and experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another war@@ ts , consider it precious and treasure the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance companies and donations of relatives and clubs allows training as well as training and supervision of death and mour@@ ning attend@@ ants .
&quot; every two years , training is offered for new employees . &quot;
&quot; the pla@@ ques described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) . &quot;
&quot; also there , additional personal wishes can be recorded on post@@ cards . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial outlook lowered for 2016 &quot;
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fers Gig@@ ant sen@@ sed his earnings outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that she plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and € 10@@ 90 in the financial year that ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous predic@@ tions . &quot;
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower outlook comes despite the price increases , which is an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and effective January 4 , and despite higher volumes for Bod@@ hau@@ sts of heavy and large packages that will be raised from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nonetheless anticip@@ ates that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online commerce . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company delivers solid yields if one considers the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for vac@@ ations were announced one day later than those of the Ri@@ val UPS who plans to employ 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , roughly the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at € 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve analy@@ st requ@@ esting analysts . &quot;
sales grew by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks asked analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , bringing sales in its unit Express delivery to stagn@@ ation . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales revenue rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result fell for higher labour costs in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in the after@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; on their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ egen spent two days this week round a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to lift the cor@@ net for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; above them at one end of the decorated , two @-@ storey meeting hall there is a wall picture of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a tw@@ o@@ fold mission from Congress : maxim@@ izing U.S. employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ dict them . on Thursday , it will be announced whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented lending rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data on the economy show that it grows solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anx@@ ious to rein@@ force this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only by a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief Econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ler@@ firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for an excuse to not increase interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which is in@@ secure in itself the financial market . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , recently sur@@ vey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted a rate of interest this week . &quot;
&quot; financial markets however expect to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of increasing . &quot;
&quot; this suggests a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists alle@@ vi@@ ate the blow by promise that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage was reached by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was raised by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintained the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the pro@@ positions at that point , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does it , &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a interest increase would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
&quot; even a month ago , the F@@ ed looked on good way to increase the proposition by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow intensi@@ fication of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als , it would be necessary that more economic progress would be needed to raise the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement in the labour market in August was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage was more than 16 % below its peak in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would damp@@ en global growth . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence influence the complex calculation when it is to increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would pull the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the U.S. staff . &quot;
now he pre@@ di@@ cts that she will wait at least one month to get a grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; said o@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved technically in their decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world . &quot;
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere hint of Ben S. Bern@@ anke at that time in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; narrow down &quot; &quot; its monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect them to not only monitor developments elsewhere but also advise other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the management of the company En@@ vest@@ net , Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundam@@ entals . &quot;
&quot; acqu@@ er , right @-@ wing member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which acts as an example of interest , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower their Lei@@ tz@@ ins by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US , &quot; Lack@@ er said . &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed @-@ Represent@@ atives did not reverse these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market re@@ union , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Sett@@ lement in the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent tur@@ mo@@ il do not come close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she fears of a recru@@ iting because the markets exc@@ ite , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed I don &apos;t think it should hur@@ ry the time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / bearing was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
&quot; LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as &quot; &quot; Thai Cost@@ co &quot; &quot; and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the public . &quot;
&quot; yes , he is in Chin@@ at@@ own and not Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / bearing is a central point of contact and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot;
there is even a car section when you need engine oil .
&quot; the shop is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the ais@@ les . &quot;
&quot; if the whole purchasing process makes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot;
the kitchen ( good and cheap ) in this shop is close to the c@@ asses and has various tak@@ eover options .
what there is here : do you need something - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are inexpensive and a number of them is sold in large quantities .
&quot; fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs , fruits and much more . &quot;
&quot; the meat the@@ ke is extensive , as well as the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and filter the fish and even cook on request for you . &quot;
&quot; a good part of the shop belongs to the massive freezer section . here you will find frozen curr@@ y leaves , bitter mel@@ on and gal@@ ang@@ s , whole du@@ cks , fish , bo@@ vine blood and g@@ all , pork nature dar@@ m , fish balls , regional saus@@ ages , commercially prepared food and more . &quot;
&quot; who bu@@ ys here : restaurant owners and coo@@ ks , also individual families and individuals . &quot;
the wide gears are suitable for trol@@ leys and forkli@@ fts .
you can find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian next to the cas@@ hier .
where it is located : the store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chin@@ at@@ own and the city center - a few blocks away by Philippe The Original .
parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area along with other shops and restaurants .
&quot; even if the shop is well attended , it is not difficult to find a parking place . &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
preparing a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she is still happy with her 74 songs .
every Thursday she is doing it in asylum seek@@ ers at Dill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , the whole of other lessons is considered to be at a proper school . &quot;
Brasili@@ a pa@@ edi@@ atric company Rio Grande fo@@ sters di@@ ets for healthy breast@@ feeding
Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization Spr@@ S tries to figure out women in shock@@ ing ways how important good nutrition during breast @-@ feeding is . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who are exposed to breasts which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to establish a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary modification that mothers should undertake . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ ylor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the building contract for the 2.3 million euros in the sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be flat for solar installation .
&quot; the planning for the long awa@@ ited gym@@ nas@@ tics hall at the Bern@@ ese sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent municipal council session , the completed construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions . &quot;
&quot; previously , among other things , the body had decided , among other things , an application for an &quot; &quot; statutory &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; from the valid construction plan . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was permission for a special form regarding the roof structure . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ middle first and roof over@@ hang &quot; should be built . &quot;
&quot; the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar panels : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; explains mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; it was again the roof @-@ prop@@ ens@@ ity , which was prescribed for energy reasons - differently than in the development plan - below ten degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the roof incl@@ ination permits no &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - with the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municip@@ ality generally de@@ pl@@ uses for liberation movements rather restric@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; however , in the field of gym@@ nas@@ tics , this is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create preced@@ ence , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um at the sports centre is a community project of the community and the SV Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at the cost , around 2.3 million euros are calculated . &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tudes .
&quot; in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now presented to the Board Office for the inspection . &quot;
clinic Pei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Pei@@ ge@@ berg Hospital should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes a new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station as well as the majority of employees pull off from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , confir@@ ming the tra@@ itor of Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss . &quot;
&quot; but a decision on this , however , meet the Supervisory Board , and the day next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans were to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees of the hospital would continue to work in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority should go to Sch@@ ong@@ au with fishermen and the existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; employees , who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the staff is informed of the plans .
&quot; the change has triggered the dism@@ iss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the direction from 1 October and to change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; in each case , for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this was a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; internal medicine &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on In@@ ner Station on g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ologic diseases .
&quot; for the next two years , fishermen agree with his team when the supervisory board agrees to both houses , until next year the former hospital of the prison , which has 35 beds , should finally be closed in Pei@@ r@@ er@@ berg after nearly 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the District Apostle had planned this for 2018 when the currently running rehabilitation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital was completed . &quot;
&quot; Mr J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , counter@@ acted rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal property , will in future be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; I just shut it out . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several considerations . &quot;
&quot; currently , there is a short term care for the Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; says Fischer about the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch , who was &quot; positive and very understandable &quot; by the staff . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , which Fischer has been working as a chief doctor for over 30 years , did not exist . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the Pei@@ ge@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the wrist bands of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Leu@@ ven are required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 ) with the Berg@@ ischen HC .
&quot; the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga is indeed the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but nobody exists . &quot;
&quot; in the last season , the Bad@@ ener took a painful defeat at the B@@ HC and did a good job there . &quot;
hunting accident with two injuries at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were severely injured during their ma@@ ize harvest by shots .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a ma@@ ize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters were in action , as the police rus@@ hed . &quot;
&quot; after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old male suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
&quot; at first , how exactly it could come to the accident was uncle@@ ar . &quot;
the Krimin@@ al@@ poli@@ zei ( Criminal Inves@@ tigation Department ) det@@ ects .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a susp@@ ect has led the police to the dead of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
&quot; in the inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old had to kill the young people and cast their body into a channel at Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has been a victim of violence since Saturday .
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ se of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ utor and police announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a matter of fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old arrested on Tuesday evening , who pointed out the fact , and the investig@@ ator went to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been missing on Sunday morning , after they did not come home after a visit to Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquaint@@ ances of the missing , a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old revealed itself . &quot;
&quot; the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ p@@ se was found . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the authorities report@@ edly killed the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds and put the cor@@ p@@ ses into the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the port @-@ fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him a death blow to him . &quot;
the announcement of the immediate circumstances of action shall bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warned against housing land
the location on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market grows .
social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers coming from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; to cover demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built every year . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; for comparison : in Germany , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany . &quot;
&quot; there@@ with 14@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a first @-@ week accommodation . &quot;
many then drive onto the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statistical Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant om@@ issions in the housing construction policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany is moving a housing deficit in front of itself , which is increased from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently , some 77@@ 0,000 residential units have already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas . Matthias Günther , author of the study , compla@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; therefore , many professionals stayed in larger towns in WG @-@ rooms . &quot;
young adults stayed for a longer stay in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the F@@ lau@@ te on the housing market .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social Housing Construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
new incentives are to revi@@ ve the social housing construction .
this could be wai@@ ved on the VAT tax and the properties will be suspended for subsi@@ dis@@ ed dwell@@ ings .
&quot; in addition , an attractive tax @-@ depreci@@ ation possibilities are necessary according to the Alliance . &quot;
the subsi@@ dy programme for refugee shel@@ ters from the Kf@@ W state bank is already well received by towns and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the available approximately 300 million euros had been rec@@ alled on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot;
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia judge a corridor
&quot; Hungary is practically no longer a transit , as more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb is announc@@ ing the trip through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian Minister of the Interior , and if necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ oj@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the shut@@ down of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees moved to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV station RT@@ L . &quot;
&quot; on the eve of the day , Hungary had signed off its border for refugees . &quot;
&quot; new laws , which entered into force on the same day , are practically superf@@ lu@@ ous in Hungary &apos;s asylum procedures . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this eventu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police had taken up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring Croatia . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they arrived with the bus as well as taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter a border fence . &quot;
the border strip poses some other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90@@ s .
mine clearance must now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; according to Hungary , there are almost no more refugees after the limit of the border . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 registered people . &quot;
shortly before the closing date on Monday it was still 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian laws make it possible to overcome and damage the border za@@ ar as a criminal off@@ ence .
&quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the Southern Hungary border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
the condemned are threatening pen@@ alties up to five years and the deport@@ ation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , on Tuesday in the &quot; Tran@@ sit &quot; established &quot; Tran@@ sit &quot; established a total of 94 asylum applications , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two older people .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , there were 40 refugees standing up there . &quot;
&quot; in practice , however , no one has any more prospect of gran@@ ting asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot; &quot;
the ex@@ pi@@ red asylum seek@@ ers are to be de@@ ported there .
&quot; in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees assembled . &quot;
workers began to clean up workers in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the gar@@ bage that tens of thousands of people left on the road@@ side in the past weeks .
shut@@ ters were disman@@ tled and one of the logging managers in the border area was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself to the aim of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria will only reach a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; the 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government figures . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , around 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot;
the train from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
&quot; in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , there were regularly smaller groups of refugees on foot . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy following the bridge on Sunday with the clearing up when suddenly ten people were standing at the door of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to take the train to Pas@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; but because Germany had surprisingly stopped the rail transport with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee stream , the Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help , was ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Nah@@ e Pas@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , we only once de@@ bar@@ ked the un@@ hoped guests , with snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we have said the same , we bring them by car to Pas@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; that was self @-@ evident to us , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man refused to give a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening , the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Pas@@ sau , to try it after the short notice that the rail traffic was set to Germany but still over the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was placed in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the bridge @-@ fest connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , the day before a two @-@ bridge sport - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends more thousands to us is a logical result of a seemingly holy policy :
&quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp immediately when constructing structures , guaranteeing humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the attitude of the Hungarian government to the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot;
leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans that are now facing the border regions with cha@@ otic states .
&quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will become a great challenge , given the ongoing flood of refugees and the approaching winter , with us decent conditions for protective seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad looking for 3@@ 5,000 Winter @-@ Solid Quar@@ ters &quot;
&quot; with the refugees , Konrad has all hands to do with the refugees . &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to set up lod@@ gings for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first recording centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees coming to Austria on Monday was also carried out without great vor@@ tices , said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad is expecting an increase of 8@@ 5,000 Quar@@ ters in the year @-@ long year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5,000 accommodation units have to be found in the next few weeks . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can create it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already conducted talks with the provincial capitals .
they would have assured him of creating districts even for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; &quot; said Ferry Ma@@ ier . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ate supports Konrad .
there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born in the morning and will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
&quot; the asylum coordin@@ ator also puts great expectations into the ORF action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping like us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels which are empty in the winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that lod@@ gings have to hold a certain height of the towel holder or size of the wa@@ ist@@ coats . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary time , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; would have to be considered . &quot;
&quot; Konrad , with his experience , establishes that he is more successful in placing an accommodation on behalf of the Interior Ministry . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gent@@ leman , whom one does not speak without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier no cost cause the republic as they themselves explained .
they want to increase their number of employees in three to four .
the own neighborhood search has not been successful so far .
Konrad wanted to put a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the approval .
Linz calls for a better division
no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , because the affected persons are currently under control without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; however , further locations should be checked for their suitability for emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
this is a cri@@ tique of the city &apos;s head of the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also contribute to their contribution .
&quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) commen@@ ced operations in the refugee question on Monday . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
&quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
there will be no more special trains with refugees in Germany .
&quot; however , the seek@@ ers would come to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee question . &quot;
the fact that Austria once again introduces controls at its borders is a logical consequence for P@@ ühr@@ inger from the German approach .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general renovation of the &quot; new ship@@ yard &quot; in the lin@@ zer industrial line is officially closed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group has moved into S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) should be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try that they work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine investing in Start@@ up firms in the new ship@@ yard , and later on which to accum@@ ulate . &quot;
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T intends to cooperate with the new neighbours - in which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises quite a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual surface in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened a second business in the arcade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
&quot; in fact , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market arcade : finally , she has now got additional growth in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around the ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; previously , several weeks have been rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I have long thought about whether I want to open a store , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were driven by the idea of their own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Groß@@ raum Linz who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has gotten incub@@ ation from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
&quot; most , when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot;
&quot; why so many women at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag into rap@@ ture , the professional lady can not answer with last security . &quot;
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag of every outfit is being upgraded .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called .
&quot; this quality also connects some to the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president wants to become . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; whether it mani@@ f@@ ests itself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , journalist , or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policies - the candidate for the US presidential office s@@ wir@@ ls the election campaign vig@@ or@@ ously . &quot;
and cuts off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate milli@@ ard originated . &quot;
the New Yorker with the short @-@ haul is a term for many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf an der Wein@@ straße .
some in the 1200 inhabitants @-@ village is related over -@@ tiny corners with it .
&quot; his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ t Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think of being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters Art , &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native city manager has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous sho@@ ots , to which besides Tr@@ ump the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit of a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; acci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the district , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; - in high German : the initi@@ ator , says it . &quot;
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ vers .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grand@@ father emig@@ rated and a pub opened for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
corner@@ stone of the real estate company were first real estate sales in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland , failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was back then . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump because he once stood out without permission , had declared the Director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , at the start of the film . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly talked to Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to sc@@ are illegal immigrants .
&quot; like the Polish , this is not so sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative tr@@ ump ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a nee Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ mother of Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement looks more dist@@ anced by the Americans , &quot; he is always so enligh@@ tening . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the Pension Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm is mentioned as many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family during a visit to the church organ donated something that was generally well anch@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that by Donald , &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they find it better if he does not win the election , for &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sag@@ as at the time of his grand@@ father in the USA would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter , Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els Film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12@@ ,000 cin@@ em@@ as , also awak@@ ens interest in the United States . &quot;

&quot; from the Vice @-@ Pres@@ idents of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den national park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot;
in the neighbouring country the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot;
at least one fifth of its area must be designated as a reserve .
&quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson agree to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has not been any major shifts in the reviews for today . &quot;
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the Federal Capital as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the down@@ fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the Ri@@ val Sun@@ rise , with the pres@@ enters David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this dis@@ advantage of the resistance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , since Sun@@ rise had an average of 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators at the five capitals , compared to today 33@@ 9,000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase over the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed in recent months . &quot;
&quot; in August today , today , today reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; in September , Sun@@ rise is at an average of 34@@ 9,000 spectators at 3@@ 14.@@ 000 at Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change concern these morning people more than the Parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father , who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show Solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven stays strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and hit The Block ( 83@@ 8,@@ 000 ) and T@@ BL Family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe yiel@@ ded an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires hot @-@ se@@ at ( 6@@ 13,@@ 000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia had 5@@ 20,000 people and in the second half an hour , 7@@ 20,000 was full . &quot;
&quot; hot Se@@ at an average of 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that Hot Se@@ at will ultimately be en@@ forced at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that did not manage to over@@ leaf the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki obviously have unknow@@ ingly revealed who the Bachelor wins . &quot;
&quot; the woman , who finally landed at Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you may acci@@ dentally have given a notice of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood sealed his lips to the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have left out ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , when the question is asked , &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods &apos;s last rose ? &quot; &quot; could their answers to the game kill become who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s degree . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly called themselves - except for themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies noticed that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the course of the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows said . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay thinks she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a pair .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week made her clear that Wood could be &quot; the One . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this obviously wasn &apos;t just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly hired , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 7 : 30 p.m. &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent en@@ quiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the ban@@ ker when he lost a don@@ key as it did the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League converter at his first unt return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a P@@ unt @-@ Return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies prior to the rest of the team by the mill he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also encouraged Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his out@@ spoken catch and to take care of the next game .
Yar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a p@@ unt recovered in the first game quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start which Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career , &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 , when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al led to a Tr@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land . &quot;
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

&quot; due to the high refugee numbers , the Free voters are demanding the attitude of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn session in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis in Bavarian schools , when there are no correspon@@ d@@ ingly new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get tests in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Parliament &apos;s parliament fraction conven@@ es Friday to Friday in the Frank@@ ish Commun@@ e .
&quot; actually , quite different main themes were en@@ vis@@ aged . &quot;
but the record number of refugees is also dominated by the Free voters meeting .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the retreat , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN Security zones for refugees in Syria , as it existed during the Yugosla@@ v wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the courts of management responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; we need standardized national standards of federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria pus@@ hes away , others not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to become more man@@ age@@ able . &quot;
but the national politics should not fall under the table in the capital city .
a long @-@ standing continuous burner remains on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , cult Minister Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; intermediate level plus &quot; at 47 Gym@@ na@@ sia , where an extension of secondary high @-@ secondary school from three to four years has been tested . &quot;
but that &apos;s what Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all the gym@@ na@@ sia who want this .
free travel at G@@ 9 anywhere you want .
stronger Wall Street helps Da@@ x on the jumps
&quot; after a long haul of the German stock market , the German stock market closed with profits . &quot;
&quot; only in the afternoon was a strong start of the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points upward . &quot;
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points . &quot;
the technology @-@ elastic Tec@@ Da@@ x increased by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 36.@@ 69 points .
&quot; the Euro@@ st@@ ox@@ x 50 as a leading index of the euro@@ zone decreased by 1.01 percent to 320@@ 7,@@ 60 points . &quot;
solid profits also bu@@ sted business places in London and Paris .
&quot; in the US , the Dow Jones Index recently noted about 1 percent in the plus . &quot;
many Bör@@ si@@ ans anticip@@ ate that the markets will be in place until after the interest in the US and also to the large decline in the dates of this Friday .
the discussion around the bur@@ dens arising from the nuclear ph@@ ase@@ out has pressed the shares from RW@@ E in the meantime to a record low and also left deep traces on E@@ on .
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies possibly lack 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot;
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
&quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered somewhat , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
Infin@@ eon shares rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the Da@@ x summit .
&quot; according to a tra@@ der , a positive report from the US an@@ le@@ ger@@ magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; appeared on the weekend . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , investors gave too little attention to the German chip manufacturer . &quot;
investment in future w@@ afer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
&quot; car @-@ values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August , more cars were dropped than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt . &quot;
the papers of the Daimler and BMW car papers grew by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.9 per cent respectively .
Volkswagen advantages were driven by 1.@@ 26 percent .
&quot; in the German pension market , the return on listed federal securities amounted to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0,50 ) percent . &quot;
the Re@@ x Pension Index rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the federal government lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
&quot; the course of the euro sunk in the afternoon to 1,@@ 12@@ 62 dollars . &quot;
&quot; against mid@@ day , the European Central Bank set the reference rate to $ 1,@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the dollar thus cost 0,@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) Euro . &quot;
4 people killed after police officers shoot rubber floor on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police explo@@ ded rubber floor in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , leading district officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , and some of you threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
&quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said , the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before taking back on rubber floor . &quot;
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber floor used , which is known that they can kill , which are traditionally used as less deadly alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the dispute was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the M@@ iz@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed as part of the proposed new constitution , would dimin@@ ish its political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal by the ethnic group of Laz@@ arus who want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature acceler@@ ates the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legisl@@ ature voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
building planned in the city
the grounds at the Em@@ der Youth Centre Alte Post shall be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
&quot; a mixture of trade , trade and housing is planned - but concrete offers are not yet available . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market some 4000 square metre plot in direct neighbourhood to the Youth Centre Old Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; planning is to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commercial and living . &quot;
wait for appropriate offers on the part of the city .
which investor should be considered is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts have been concluded . &quot;
&quot; the town of Em@@ den had already bought a part of the plot , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner of the Große Straße , already a few months ago and the building was demoli@@ shed . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans of the cottage settlement at the Small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
some tra@@ ilers are further wor@@ rying - they fear the sell @-@ off of their leisure area
&quot; for months , behind closed doors was negoti@@ ated , deb@@ ated , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now there are plans for a new cottage near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the prospective buyer , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented his plans for the first time in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ de Council on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under the pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf B@@ ehr@@ ends went into the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
heavy reactions among marine owners who came to the meeting called the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building .
&quot; Roberto Schulz , the owner of the sea and board member of the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this is a giant cla@@ d that over@@ looks all other structures . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he fears like a number of other project critics that traffic would greatly increase by the intended size of the system : &quot; there must be whole bus loads , so that this is worth it , &quot; said Schulz &quot;
&quot; however , what is happening on the well one hect@@ are of the former inn is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf B@@ ehr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google La@@ un@@ ches Dou@@ bling Don@@ ations Campaig@@ n to Coll@@ ect 11 Million $ for Refu@@ ge@@ es
&quot; Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise 11 million $ for humanitarian organizations , which will help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing the European nations because they are fle@@ eing from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the Don@@ ation call on his blog .
&quot; instead of making a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google associate , who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip included many dark rail and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first globally collected donations tot@@ aled € 5.5 million to goo@@ gle@@ .com / refuge@@ es@@ el@@ ief .
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many also escaped from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;
report by Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; adaptation of Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for easily over@@ weight di@@ abe@@ tics can be helpful in weight loss surgery .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if easily over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data needed a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an Editorial to the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity has proven to be efficient to treat type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been performed in people who are path@@ ologically obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain measure of weight relative to size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital identified data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and stomach tu@@ bing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly over@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those who under@@ went this operation fell from 31 to 24,@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , BM@@ I was among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment roughly equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; under those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease was completely dissolved and 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally treated group , in comparison with this , the type of diabetes reli@@ eved completely only by one percent and partly with only about 2 percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ ro@@ omy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching larger decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.4 against 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show any survival benefit after five years , there are indications of a study of he@@ avier men in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who under@@ went obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study did not benefit for survival in the surgery patient , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for persons with a BM@@ I below 35 , who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long for us to take people seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes is a revers@@ al really difficult .
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a theme that is growing attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ attractive for school times , meets the flock of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recent novel &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers as he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ lers and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is happy that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot absorb all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
&quot; the Dalai Lama spoke to the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies . &quot;
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed against the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the response from Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admir@@ able , but the situation was not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a true peace and true development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we have to think about how the killing is dimin@@ ished in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on September 11 and turned out that the US &apos;s violent reaction resulted in a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to resolve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and that has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four@@ fold increase in the intake of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
&quot; toxic control centers in the US report about an almost 400 % increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , who swal@@ low heavily alcoholic hand san@@ iti@@ zer , thus the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of hand san@@ iti@@ ers in children under the age of 12 were reported to report from 3,@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in emergency , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants inten@@ tionally while some do it to impress their friends , or because of a test of courage in the social media . &quot;
YouTube videos show how adolescents drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
young people have allegedly mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a tough@@ er drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing for children . &quot;
hand san@@ iti@@ zer contain anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in to@@ dd@@ lers a few sp@@ las@@ ers can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ ison emergency center at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 in kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip Whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come to it then it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had four inj@@ ections of sc@@ ented hand san@@ iti@@ zer in school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment . &quot;
&quot; your blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , which is considered as being drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency medical doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah sum@@ mon@@ ed her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors supervised her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had pushed his head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use soft products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store hands dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died following the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ectious agents that contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities susp@@ ect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a fatal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in New York were planning to po@@ ison their &quot; gem@@ s &quot; by taking anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand san@@ iti@@ zer and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; the police watched the failed plan as &quot; &quot; Gesch@@ i@@ ät@@ z &quot; &quot; and instruc@@ ted disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot;

&quot; there are rum@@ ours about dis@@ cord at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths spontane@@ ously . it insi@@ sted that he and his team mates were not under elevated control , because they are preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scotland bored Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and earlier national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they do not show highlights of Celtic games and why ? &quot;
it is because the angers aren &apos;t there .
people here speak not only about the return of the R@@ angers .
you are talking about Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of excitement in Old Firm games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn around the things , swe@@ ars by Dei@@ la . &quot;
R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic fight needs to fight but the Norwegian chef s@@ wore to turn things around .
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the next departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , now with five points , is clearly at the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; Celtic already had bad times before and we will return . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what is happening . &quot;
we feel that exactly like that - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the player better . &quot;
standing together is so important .

&quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is rising altogether . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period May to July , while the number of people without labor for the United Kingdom as a whole rose to 1.@@ 82 million at the same time as a whole . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent lay over the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent as the numbers of the Bureau for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed .
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland decreased by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;

why I will be witness@@ ing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the po@@ ison sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shock@@ ed , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day drew closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists may see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applications available than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
&quot; who will be selected , will surely watch it emotion@@ less . &quot;
I cannot .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants and you get access .
I compla@@ in with her .
&quot; she admitted that she could have form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; it could have been better &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go down here again for all the details .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary .
but I believe that there is a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood that it is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .
man after mo@@ ist police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he talked to the man from the Cann@@ ing River .
&quot; an attempt by a man from Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sum@@ p@@ tuous water , a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was called into a back@@ yard incident in Becken@@ ham . &quot;
&quot; when they discovered the susp@@ ect , he tried to escape them in the direction of Cann@@ ing River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &apos; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ have@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negoti@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
Championship @-@ soccer player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of Ben C@@ ous@@ ins Bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end the racing sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to end the race immediately .
&quot; he reli@@ ed on the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it comes to the positive cob@@ alt t@@ amp@@ er probe near Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had kept back 18 months because of the sp@@ ying accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it was going on .
&quot; sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with it what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to walk around the head , and I want my owners to think that I do my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had raised the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.@@ Get that the integrity @-@ department had tried to spy out his stable . &quot;
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ am .
&quot; if that is the case , they should surely touch their n@@ oses because they have failed in trying to hold me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today . &quot;
should this bring me to the view that it is personal ?
did the R@@ V@@ L behave passi@@ vely and perhaps do people outside of coaches be responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am it .
&quot; perhaps they have to take my license and put me away , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it . &quot;
but I have now arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them and press them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the trainers &apos; levels have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led him to &quot; &quot; throw his license on the table &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by preparing the un@@ defeated Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , the race @-@ day treatment rule was &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse &apos;s debate , which was against the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my colleagues mistaken mud on the leg .
it could have been so last night .
it could have been so yesterday all day that was so .
but it was also so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the day of the race . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we went too far , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man arrested after driver &apos;s flight
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a colli@@ sion with a cycli@@ st and subsequent driver &apos;s flight in Cob@@ ham . &quot;
the cycli@@ st was supplied with helicop@@ ter to the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the driver drove on without stopping to help the injured driver .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from Nath@@ alia joined the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
he is expected to be indic@@ ted for driver cur@@ sed and subordin@@ ated assistance and other traffic codes .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy beats against ri@@ vals because of claims on ring battle
&quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; of two Premier League favorites of the NR@@ L . &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Train@@ ers Tr@@ ent Robinson replied that the arbit@@ rators brought the Storm @-@ players &quot; Ring battle &quot; with his team during the high storm @-@ victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne B@@ enn@@ ett made a little disgu@@ sted note to the Storm team after his team had achieved the Final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample game &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they were only concentr@@ ating on their &quot; contact . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers of his team gave him a confident voice , because it was claimed that they were worried about the Storm team to be beaten . &quot;
&quot; this always appears - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about Ring @-@ fights when they struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have not changed anything about our def@@ en@@ sive system or techniques throughout the year . but over the last six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided for us the turn@@ around . &quot;
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and obviously he has a great team to train .
&quot; it is funny , as it appears again and again at this time of the year . &quot;
Bell@@ amy attacked B@@ enn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the premi@@ er league in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our on Friday evening , and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 , St George was critici@@ zed as a te@@ di@@ ous team , and Wa@@ yne has said he &apos;ll take care of a stake . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and which we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt so they can play like this . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger trust , because they say these things because they are a bit worried to have to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they did not think about us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm vs. R@@ oo@@ sters game achieved a higher result than the Game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me it is the game boards .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will still meet them in a phase . &quot;
the Storm team is free at this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday evening in the pre @-@ fin@@ als at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; ser@@ ene with 200,000 $ deposit after drug delivery &quot;
&quot; a man who could possibly thre@@ aten a life @-@ long sentence due to his attempt to get possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a security deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and put in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina during the mor@@ nings and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
&quot; despite a possibly life @-@ long penalty for trying to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café he could have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of criminal proceedings , he lied to the police about his place of residence . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in order to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Richter Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but this alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against damage , under the conditions that he ab@@ ides in his Australian and his Serbian passport , reported daily to the police and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
an accident on A5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab rides apart
&quot; during a rear @-@ end colli@@ sion with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday night . &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent building in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried to ev@@ ade in vain at the last moment to turn left like the police rus@@ hed .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ causing outbreak broke completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 Euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure p@@ ests to send pictures
a p@@ est hel@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone as she slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent pictures of children that were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping bun@@ ny .
she saw it and found the conf@@ using news and al@@ armed her mother immediately .
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzing computers found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; relevant &quot; &quot; web searches , which used words to search for in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; p@@ ests on the Internet &quot; and then &quot; pret@@ ended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction to be addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that searches were performed on the computer by him , but said it was to happen , because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are p@@ ests . &quot;
he was asked about his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and which he asked to send more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the messages on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the def@@ end@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the def@@ end@@ ant computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment , in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the conditions on January 25 and not appearing before the court to a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; attorney Gregor S@@ im asked for H@@ og@@ g not to appear in the Registry of Sex@@ ual Criminal Inves@@ tig@@ ations , as one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; could be found in his crime . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ sta@@ ir Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael retired until October to receive background reports on social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted a security deposit , but was held in custo@@ dy for hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
he was received before the date of judgment in the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
Schle@@ user devi@@ ates from small cross @-@ border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up from the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many tu@@ g@@ users were driven by fear of discovery and arrest .
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the federal police said . &quot;
&quot; along the border river Inn , more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the coun@@ ties of Pas@@ sau and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday . &quot;
they had reached the German side by foot over bridges and the dam .
there they are received by the police officers and forwarded to the registration .
&quot; in comparison to the start of the week , much more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station in comparison to the start of the week . &quot;
&quot; at 8@@ am , some 700 people arrived in the provincial capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
&quot; following the re @-@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city . &quot;
&quot; Stuttgart : sp@@ ear@@ ners of dri@@ p tower &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; expected in the southwest &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn of assault drops in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air currently streams into the country , distributed the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the powerful low was the prec@@ urs@@ or of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; who was drawn from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days . &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected primarily in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ WD , until Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the ground @-@ seek@@ er with Bö@@ en from 60 to 90 ho@@ urs@@ days . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the car owners will show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; in 2015 , it is mainly active in the compact cars that are currently especially well @-@ sold . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registrations fell to this segment alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Public Days 17th to 27th of September ) .
&quot; this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the fut@@ uris@@ tic concept cars and new luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; one of the largest premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , who will be at deal@@ er@@ ships in the fall . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel introduces a new entry below the largest competi@@ tor of VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra will cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; furthermore , the Hessen will offer other diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door models . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which can also be seen at the IAA . &quot;
and what will be continued on new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a five @-@ door model in a conventional and under@@ lined sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; he comes in trading at the beginning of next year , and then as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan Ab@@ lay wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter tur@@ bo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 HP . &quot;
the maximum torque is based on manufacturer data at 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
the launch of the bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new but completely renewed is the compact car model DS 4 which can be seen at the IAA .
&quot; outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n stor@@ ef@@ ront put their hands on the front compartment : here the radiator grill was re@@ painted and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , especially the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated into Apple Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants at the IAA in the compact class , such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 G@@ TI . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court ordered an ex @-@ prisoner of the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Te@@ gel which was lod@@ ged for months in a small cell .
&quot; due to the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
&quot; this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court on Wednesday , which was published on Wednesday . &quot;
the persons affected can even hope for money if they were imprisoned for a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
this was a successful ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square meters floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not isolated .
&quot; after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now back on a free foot , was transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
his office of office because of the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the Land Berlin failed .
but the constitutional refer@@ endu@@ ms raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ als and dismis@@ sed the case for renewed examination .
they see the human dignity of the man injured .
chamber court decides now on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if due to legal reasons , only a few days of liability for compensation are decisive for compensation , a compensation claim was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; to fear the privacy of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ als must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
&quot; in recent years , problems of matching the skill requirements of jobs and employees &quot; qualifications have come into the focus of scientific discussions . &quot;
&quot; so they spoke to a prisoner in@@ dem@@ nity in April , because he was naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 , too , the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , having agreed to an in@@ decent housing for a prisoner in a parallel event in November 2009 . &quot;
the then pla@@ inti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated three months a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also come into the head@@ lines because of the lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; therefore , prisoners are always locked in 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even to fight @-@ h@@ unters it should have happened because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Jus@@ tiz@@ press@@ est@@ elle , 21 jobs in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of lack of young@@ sters , 19 shall fall away in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create that &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany even capable of taking up a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we can do that .
what is coming up in Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to differ@@ ing forecasts , between 350,000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are held annually - for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as is currently being built ( 25@@ 0000 flats ) .
&quot; the lack of housing is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental objects : 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing are exp@@ elled annually , and in order to apply these particularly cheap apartments to refugees . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing one year would have to arise and therefore , the federal government would have to invest € 6.4 billion per year . &quot;
scientists and Federal Minister for Transport agree that there must be more tax benefits for housing construction .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is vital whether they find employment in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the recording company , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says Mig@@ rant Inves@@ tig@@ ator Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; according to Thr@@ en@@ hardt , it has given a political change in Germany : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to the recognition of labour . &quot;
&quot; while there was previously a ban on asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the Residen@@ z@@ pf@@ licht to restrict the asylum seek@@ ers to a residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the shortage of skilled labour , it has become widely accepted that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market more quickly . &quot;
insufficient knowledge of the German language is a big barrier for access to the labour market .
&quot; so far , there is still no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses . &quot;
research also shows that work@@ places are most often communicated by personal contacts .
&quot; therefore , the structure of networks is the King &apos;s Path to work integration according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration determined that only a few escaped parents give their children to Kit@@ as , estimated at least ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ ro@@ oting parents , it is only once quite important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ z@@ hin , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ books in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators is growing strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase educational capacity - for example by allowing more specialised schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students with no knowledge of German will be prepared in the lessons of welcome classes . &quot;
&quot; but they are not always taught by educated teachers but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have qualifications in German as second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ range from Berlin &apos;s school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk under@@ estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal state asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his attitude . &quot;
&quot; for refugees , the access to the university could be facilit@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; because refugees with a residence permit or a debt do not receive services according to asylum seek@@ ers &apos; law more if they start studying . &quot;
&quot; in principle , the latter does not receive B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , as it does not fall under the circle of authorized persons . &quot;
&quot; patient refugees had so far had to live in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing gap has to be closed , but Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ um@@ b to Islam succ@@ essi@@ vely the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state church right to develop a new state @-@ of @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
it would also be important to establish an Islamic sanc@@ tion association which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
rights also belong to the rights .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options . &quot;
this also includes a willingness to fight against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed the concern that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to pun@@ ish such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in the Bavarian Radio . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be a lot more than today a topic of the whole of society .
&quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , reducing discrimination and rac@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law for a decade . &quot;
but it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NS@@ U murder series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
&quot; the same opportunities for all : what migrants &quot; organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long demanded and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention in Germany commit , must become reality in the next few years if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is capable of medi@@ cally supplying the previously expected refugees , says Dr. Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must be incorporated into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls for all newcom@@ ers to sign health cards right away . &quot;
services rendered could later be calculated with the Länder .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to serve as many people with the limited catalogue of services offered by the asylum seek@@ er law . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors mainly make the language barrier possible . &quot;
&quot; so far , so far , the Berlin Health Scienti@@ st The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more aware of their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over , they demand . &quot;
but many refugees have also been helped with more general medical procedures in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic sight .
&quot; under refugee children , for example , there are clearly more untreated disabilities , and the young people are concerned about HIV / AIDS . &quot;
&quot; but with the partially other disease pictures , German physicians came from their training however clearly , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect &quot; &quot; and what concerns the shortage of doctors is perhaps even relief in sight by the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed education system , several refugees even were doctors . &quot;
&quot; however , in order to practice , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly need to take tests . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study conducted by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee status arrives traum@@ ati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with difficulty breathing , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart r@@ att@@ ling and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders , strong sc@@ ari@@ dity and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the symptoms chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; however , up to now only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , mentally ill seek@@ ers in the social @-@ offices can submit an application for psych@@ otherapy , but usually lasts several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social @-@ offices mostly non @-@ skilled workers or doctors , who are not trained for mental illness , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream

&quot; the goal is to draw any age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now , the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to the man@@ ege on the brick @-@ wash basin to dream . &quot;
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - this motto is the current stage of management . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
&quot; thus , the gift to the spiritu@@ als is in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to take the people away from their everyday life and take them in a completely different world for two hours , &quot; empha@@ sizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ Smur@@ f@@ cocktail with cos@@ mop@@ olitan flair , &quot; explains director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilomet@@ re tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov C@@ lown Family draws the audience with w@@ it and charm . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .

60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; empha@@ sizes Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst looks at her position : &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we don &apos;t go well . &quot;
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each match @-@ unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ sts , &quot; as they are lov@@ ingly called , will be read by the eyes whenever possible . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the beast does not feel well , it does not want to fall into the arena . &quot;
so the upper@@ most command : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mix of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst looks proudly . &quot;
the two animals lived together for eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , was our little jum@@ bo there , &quot; &quot; said Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or a 200 audience , we always give our best and are there with all our heart . &quot;
&quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst invites every day from September 17 to 20 , every day at 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. &quot;
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the screening at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , every day the animal show is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs by a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread over the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by claims by members of the opposition , that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with a collector &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had bu@@ gged him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in the parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
spokes@@ man of Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it war@@ ns the affected Parliament members that the immun@@ ity will end in the Parliament , and as soon as they leave Parliament their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
&quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30.000 work@@ stations
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
HP will later split into two listed companies this year and dis@@ connect the computer and printer business from its faster growing enterprise hardware and its service activities .
&quot; the expected loss of jobs leads to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , CEO and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ reachable , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement . &quot;
it spl@@ its a company founded in the 19@@ 30s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to make electric systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley .
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring in order to tackle the conversion from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September , and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his story his participation in the next summer of the European Championship will surely be uncertain . &quot;
the great shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to its old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but like Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has listed 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of ar@@ sen@@ als 157 league players in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the risk of injuries will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win battle power , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope that his body stabili@@ ses , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he ear@@ ns . &quot;
ar@@ sen@@ al will start his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur the next Wednesday and Wen@@ ger presents a rotation within the team .
&quot; Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are allowed to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it to get a little break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsen@@ al &apos;s favorites are to come through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched last season .
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , being measured on the Richter scale 3 : 2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that ar@@ sen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains of the distant hope to lead the association to its first European Cup triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it never worked at Arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
celebration of Friend@@ ship : the com@@ edy show giving us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now desper@@ ate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove at a 15 @-@ year @-@ high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than in women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campaig@@ n Aga@@ inst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably announced in 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of ques@@ tioning the culture that men hin@@ ders to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the fight to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy disposition , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends so that a friendship can function .
&quot; in the age of communication led by social media , with its focus on style about substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , live and successful , even if in reality the isolation predomin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much more deeply . &quot;
and how a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained money can really not buy happiness .
the Schön@@ e at Friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments during football in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to each case , even if they often hold back to explore completely their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of teleph@@ ony pastoral care , I explained : &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who are de@@ pressed and sus@@ cep@@ tible to suicide , has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often not able to talk with friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , such as feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one talks about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes into mind when I try to offer long @-@ lasting cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she presents clearly the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider status over the telephone to help people in moments of despair too , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed setting , why not take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or even better if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship might make .

di Maria meets PS@@ G to help mal@@ ign@@ ant Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
&quot; at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , di Maria helps to pass by PS@@ G to Malm@@ ö . &quot;
here are the gam@@ eplay and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain launched its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö at the Prin@@ zen@@ park Stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who made the French champion the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris takes a strong start against the Swedish champion , as it does not only seek the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he began his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to bring problems back to our opponents , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals scored . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris @-@ Team , which ended on the weekend a 2 : 2 draw on its own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was st@@ ung out in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing stor@@ my was named as the man who could take the PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , and he pointed out why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Mal@@ mo defense , before he passed along nicely into the long corner of the nest . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Mal@@ mo , who suggested Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a major opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot of Nik@@ ola Dj@@ ur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they did little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes got up , with some fla@@ ws and bad results , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was scra@@ pped by no less than five attempts in the first half alone and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani used it after re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he put his te@@ amm@@ ates into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c that turned Di Maria into a shot , which was passing by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute by the pole ... &quot;
the second goal finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus achieved his sixth season tor after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had found a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back into play , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could keep low before substitute players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi had been recognized by a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which has not the same level . &quot;
the qualification games do not suff@@ ice . &quot;
hat@@ s off Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ enc@@ ore ga@@ thers 2.5 billion dollars through share sales
&quot; the mining giant Gl@@ enc@@ ore , resident in Switzerland , which is affected by collap@@ sing raw materials prices , collected $ 2.5 billion by a stock sale as part of its huge debt settlement plan . &quot;
Gl@@ enc@@ ore registered in London in an explanation that it has sold new shares worth approximately $ 1.6 billion in order to pay off its own debts .
&quot; the company , which in this year has lost 57 percent of its market value , struggles with falling commodity prices as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and devast@@ ating markets . &quot;
the output of reference rights brought the Gl@@ en@@ cores share price on trading on the early Wednesday morning a rapid increase to the top of the London stock exchange .
&quot; the share jump@@ ed by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
Gl@@ enc@@ ore had announced the 2.5 billion $ share sale last week as a part of the more comprehensive plans to wi@@ pe about a third of its 30 billion $ debt .
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings at 125 P@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
&quot; concerns relating to long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

the White House endor@@ ses Xi J@@ in@@ p@@ ings visit to Washington
&quot; Chinese president , Xi J@@ in@@ ping , will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month , confir@@ ming the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , first official in Washington , will take place on September 25 and res@@ ists President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
the US President and the First Lady Mich@@ elle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan for a Sta@@ ats @-@ D@@ iner once the two leaders have bilateral talks .
&quot; President &apos;s visit will provide the opportunity to extend the American @-@ Chinese cooperation with a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi also give the opportunity to construc@@ tively engage areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; &quot; adds the statement . &quot;
&quot; XI , whose visit first announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on its way to Washington before travelling to New York City on the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi are addressing a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber@@ spi@@ on@@ age of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea . &quot;

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented change from FC Bayern in 2008
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern obviously stood in front of the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who played for FC Barcelona back then . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times champion winner , four times winner @-@ league winner , twice Club World Champion , twice World Champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the meanwhile 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
but in an interview with Mar@@ ca X@@ avi now reveals that he was standing in front of Barcelona before the European Championship 2008 .
I told Bar@@ ça to sell me .
&quot; Madrid won anything at that time , we say nothing , &quot; he tells . &quot;

X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
and the pi@@ vot@@ al man for this works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great European Championship .
PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me .
&quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , the Red Army pulled out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King class triumph at the end . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on playing diversity in film creation
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the Afgh@@ an film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown while discussing the variety and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a succession of Sunday Night by HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown , when he stressed the need for alternative perspectives , stressed the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagon@@ ist in the selected screen@@ play of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film and not during the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shock@@ ed , with anno@@ yed un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! Wow . okay &quot; &quot; when the comments from the actor by The Mar@@ tian fast@@ ened . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to encourage people to think about - whoever will be the director - how they treat the character of Harmony , &quot; &quot; Brown first said . &quot;
the only black person and she is a sp@@ line beaten by her white hal@@ ves .
&quot; the producer of Dear White People was campaig@@ ning for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said their direction &quot; &quot; at the end could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded against dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni pressed his anger over the clip , writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 re@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved nationwide impact and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to resort to discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured co@@ hes@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Hassel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is uncle@@ ar .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sports club Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
&quot; the competition @-@ show , which just finished its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant which could complete all levels of its obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten managed to finish in the final . &quot;
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time , which he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the ti@@ ring phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge in three seconds faster , making him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock , about winning the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or had a life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the senior producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , despite being the first at all , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; when there &apos;s more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changed life , it gets the great rati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he has any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he did .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family man .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same if they had di@@ pped the roles .
America Nin@@ ja War@@ rior was extended for an A@@ ged Season that will start fil@@ ming in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for Detroit &apos;s Tig@@ ers .
&quot; in the past , they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eb@@ all , today the tig@@ ers stand on the last square in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field on Tuesday . &quot;
the T@@ wins granted a chance to climb within one half of the Houston Astro@@ s for the second American League wild card place .
&quot; for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Per@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon kept his early offensive support , when Detroit punc@@ tured three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strong , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw at the bul@@ l@@ pen of each game , and so I want to go quite concentrated in the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated Tiger Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first r@@ bis since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ hit game from Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against Seattle Navy on July 6th .
&quot; he has s@@ wind@@ led the s@@ ap@@ wood , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked much better out of the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh inside , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into play . &quot;
center Fiel@@ der B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks got a B@@ unt and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the lef@@ th@@ and Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy ran down wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who opened a two @-@ run to the right @-@ h@@ ander Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen added the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe beat a Double Play .
&quot; after Detroit , at the end of the ninth inn@@ ings , added a Insurance Run , Wall built R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the level of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ h@@ ander , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for its fifth save . &quot;
Detroit benefited at the start of the game from a still im@@ movable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been removed from the risk of injuries prior to the game after having been missing more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches since in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; when they first received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ ham gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game that created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z created his 0 @-@ 21 success story with the run@@ ners in scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third player Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right , creating another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers placed in the second , scored a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose for 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not beat well , but he caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ic Right @-@ handed A. J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the litter .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated on San@@ che@@ z &apos;s shoulder in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the risk of injuries because of a shoulder @-@ down las@@ hing , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is removed from the drop of injuries to start the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 in four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30th July
he has been missing since August 20 because of a twist in the right hip .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ERA ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people involved in this should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden as the city of Wiesbaden ex@@ pi@@ red on Tuesday night .
it reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the H@@ essi@@ an state capital have been prepared for this event in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily under@@ mine there .
they shall then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , there were 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse after the government pres@@ idency appointed for the first time . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe that resol@@ ute thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he designed the European States &quot; collective &quot; looking . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , one was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had passed a military involvement in Germany . &quot;
&quot; now the conflict ends up in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid for the refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian interior minister , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening in Austrian television station ORF . &quot;
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement on which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said it had already given talks between the General Director of Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
she did not call concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary . &quot;
your goal is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
&quot; in view of the strong refugee status in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the first @-@ up and distribution of people more strongly . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who need protection , also compla@@ in . &quot;
&quot; but those who don &apos;t have a lead @-@ perspective , can &apos;t stay in Germany either . &quot;
this view had been ind@@ eli@@ bly divided into the round .
the Chancellor emphas@@ ised that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees are now stuck on the can@@ opy route .
Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re border to Serbia in the night of Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbour country is different from Serbia on the EU .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government sentenced the plan immediately .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , meanwhile , the witnesses reported thousands of more migrants to the Greek border . &quot;
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond de cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean s@@ app@@ ends .
this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
so the moon dives easily on his or@@ bit around the ring planet .
&quot; although this exchange movement is only small , but too big for a consistent cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) on Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers are presenting their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was already known that there must be liquid water under the ice @-@ blanket of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; in 2006 , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had discovered iron vul@@ can@@ es in the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ moon in 2006 , sp@@ inning the water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers included at that time . &quot;
&quot; however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama missing 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München must refra@@ in from Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
&quot; an examination has resulted in an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association dealt with . &quot;
R@@ ama had already compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich Leu@@ ven , diagnosis is expected to mean four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; said sport director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ g@@ ün the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of a club @-@ free pro@@ s . &quot;
&quot; as a guest , the Six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man . &quot;
the 30 year old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at present , the Cro@@ at has the opportunity to prove his skill . &quot;
&quot; tor@@ so Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie , after his conc@@ ussion , can return to the team training next week . &quot;
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is supposed to embar@@ k on a running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had hurt in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) with a sharp colli@@ sion on his head .
&quot; contrary to the first fears , he remained without a serious bl@@ ur . &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line , he is often advised by them . &quot;
because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
&quot; however , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular Mang@@ os contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who e@@ ats the fruits thus supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ go should not be too soft or too firm and pleasantly smell . &quot;
the colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure naturally or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives sav@@ our@@ y dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter flavor of some blo@@ at@@ ts@@ al@@ ate like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; and a man@@ go ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , p@@ oultry , lamb and game . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. parcel service UPS places up to 95@@ 0,000 means for the Christmas business in the United States . &quot;
&quot; the company already started with recruitment of seasonal workers , UPS announced on Tuesday . &quot;
especially drivers are looking for .
&quot; last year , UPS had raised its staff for the holiday season by 95@@ 0,000 . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , UPS and his competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex have had prior arrangements since last year to be ready for Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , late deliveries have brought the parcel service to harsh criticism . &quot;
&quot; first tor@@ to@@ ise , then striking cold front &quot;
&quot; in the next night , in the valleys of the Alps side of the F@@ öh@@ n , Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz divided on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and in the night for th@@ urs@@ day , the F@@ öh@@ n blows partly with storm strength through the con@@ cili@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; after f@@ anning on Thursday morning a striking cold front crosses us , which brings powerful ra@@ inf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area on the British Is@@ les in a strong south @-@ western direction . &quot;
&quot; on the mountain side of the Alps , the cave breaks through the valleys at night to Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the fle@@ a until Thursday morning blows in the can@@ yon valleys with Bö@@ en from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and partly in the Ur@@ i land partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ öh@@ n can advance in places to the adjacent Plateau , and in the mountains even organs from above 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my fo@@ ehn allow for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the Alps of the Alps . &quot;
&quot; here , rain stops , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in sum , south of the Alps must be counted in the next 48 hours with partly over 100 liters of rain per square meter , this after large ra@@ inf@@ all have occurred in the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning blow the air out , in a row , a cold front rolls with powerful , partly we@@ ather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front the wind is blowing strongly to stor@@ my , and the temperatures are clearly coming back . &quot;
&quot; the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south the weekend is sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of the City President Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the consortium of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , the pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es of the Pop@@ es of the Pop@@ es could often only live in sec@@ rec@@ y for centuries as a minority . &quot;
the pla@@ za is symbo@@ lically visible that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he found the city at that time as a comm@@ ended sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him by historians in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the split of the Western Church with his theses against the decl@@ ining trade .
hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown crown is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Old has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; images . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the particular subject , it can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subjective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles , which focus on topics such as cross paths , pla@@ gues , commandments , or fa@@ ther@@ land . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he spontane@@ ously fascinated several partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages from Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into today , into current contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and each one of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the respective situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of intim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant royal order . &quot;
&quot; since the up@@ bringing took place with the pipe , &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt &quot; &quot; re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work this up , perhaps to bring myself back to the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to rel@@ ieve the art of art in a quick@@ ened time : &quot; &quot; the perception of visual worlds is today shaped by advertising , and it is no@@ isy . &quot;
symboli@@ sm is displac@@ ed .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer fall into the images , letting them work , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost had always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings .
&quot; I did not care to fully compreh@@ end the Bible , but also chosen the most important , also mysterious subjects for him . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; this is about the images , the text only explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on November 15 . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
&quot; plans made , place found , company engaged , Erd@@ hü@@ gel mod@@ elled for a round trip : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn , it was finally finished . &quot;
&quot; om@@ issions in politics and administration ensured the imp@@ etus , especially among residents who didn &apos;t want to toler@@ ate the train . &quot;
&quot; thus hill shel@@ tered , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the approval will take place in October , the first joint municipality of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck could now communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
it should then be started without a cease @-@ fire with the work of the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football re@@ acts to the wor@@ sen@@ ing situation in Germany and ass@@ ures the policy of its help in cop@@ ing with the upcoming problems .
&quot; I consider this for the greatest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there can be no one in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this has to be of interest to each individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin , he plans to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; the topic surely will play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football can and may help .
&quot; the decisive turn@@ outs , however , must place the policy . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the German Football Association has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years . &quot;
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; explained K@@ Nier@@ sbach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal agencies also support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs put a clear sign when they are on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; We assist - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; said L@@ ever@@ kus@@ ens Sports Director Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the drama @-@ drama goes everyone , nobody is allowed to go away . &quot;
&quot; we can help football federal government , no , we must use our beam force , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
&quot; H@@ offen@@ heim managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the Euro @-@ qualification game against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; Nier@@ sbach called for the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 Lic@@ en@@ sees had started their own projects in their places was great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; which we have issued is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government provides 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; reported Ms. Nier@@ sbach . &quot;
reports : SAP Executive Officer loses an eye in accident
&quot; the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , report@@ edly lost the left eye by a down@@ fall at the beginning of July . &quot;
&quot; during the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ ed , fa@@ inted , has then dra@@ gged out onto the street - he told us so last week , &quot; quotes the &quot; W@@ IW@@ O &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can do his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come to Germany again in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I am full of SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I stood in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot;
it &apos;s important to get up again when you please .
Mc@@ L@@ aren Re@@ placement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen we@@ ather@@ ed a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
&quot; therefore , during the weekend in Singapore , he is just as little as a spare driver for the two common pilots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , as one week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us , in the first group play of the Europa League , have finally broken . &quot;
the national player will be missing the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; we can &apos;t resort to him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach opened : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high load of his pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his master eleven on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the por@@ ter &apos;s position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of regular b@@ art@@ ender Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open for the future in all European League matches . &quot;
&quot; with high probability , he will also ride the second game . &quot;
&quot; the research statement by Mit@@ r@@ ussi@@ a Re@@ us , that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , middle @-@ field player Julian W@@ eig@@ l holds for comprehen@@ sible : &quot; thus Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to access the title .
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants a pioneering role for Germany
&quot; according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , sees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the Autom@@ ated IAA from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
he also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states who also come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA .
&quot; among other things , the Ministry of Transport &apos;s strategy paper highlights the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a fast growing on digital radio . &quot;
&quot; to test new technology , there is currently a test track on the 9 motorway in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework conditions &quot; and , where necessary , will adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to use internationally for the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only sees the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car increasingly takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more the passenger . &quot;
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study published by the Ministry of Economics , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , vehicles on public roads are not expected to be expected until 2020 . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of passenger cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;

&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to completely rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; following a survey of the digital network Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could still show 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent . &quot;
well each fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; at present , Düsseldorf wants to beat only in singles on the title fight between September 25 and October 4 . &quot;
the final decision is to be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys learned it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to take the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at this time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship date in China . &quot;
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo &apos;s the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; declared Single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who runs the S@@ etz@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded of the European Championship 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo also lack@@ ed , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; we should orient@@ ate it , &quot; declared the fifth fifth . &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the cli@@ ma@@ xes : window man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins which look terrible out of human appearance thanks to video proj@@ ections .
&quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who among other things became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in the skir@@ ts . &quot;
I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ak , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation from September 18th , it is a luck that the fashion designer has changed his attitude toward a show above his person . &quot;
&quot; actually he was on the other hand , because : &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into this hardly ever @-@ looking work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is a super@@ bly chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall art work for which much effort was carried out : to fres@@ hen the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired . &quot;
14 tons of material have checked the makers according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot in Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , timi@@ d , fashionable walk@@ ways of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy Bear and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; playing with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later taught the design of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers who told Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them but of course .
&quot; for his first own fashion show , he did not have to pay the models . &quot;
&quot; they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewelry instead of sheer curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener tip as fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters . &quot;
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were created in a large quantity for customers who processed them for example on ceilings and she@@ ers .
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the fashion titles P@@ lau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , was then pushed out by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styli@@ stic eras , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
those who have no ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already make half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , Mr. P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ der@@ ies . &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have fallen away . &quot;
private specialist stores and wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; nowadays , mass production is much cheaper in the Asian region and is sold almost exclusively via chains . &quot;
&quot; it also weak@@ ens exports , currently to Russia and the USA . &quot;
enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association tries to score by environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer has declared by the nitrogen le in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year we have been managing a seal of quality that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially sustainable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt compl@@ ements : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger branch of the West@@ sächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroi@@ dery and lac@@ es .
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; this creates a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; Schmidt says . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base . &quot;
some years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter revi@@ ved the historical Schne@@ eb@@ all@@ spitze .
&quot; in the process , the machine suff@@ oc@@ ates small ch@@ icks in some places . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ en Gold schm@@ ie@@ de@@ meister Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ße was inspired : &quot; before , I couldn &apos;t do anything with traditional pubs . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in an elaborate process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also delivers in the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and the surrounding area and who want to mem@@ ori@@ ze a piece of memory . &quot;
I see my jewellery as modern amb@@ ass@@ adors of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; legends should not be touched , but Disney is still dar@@ ing about a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; it is not about a re @-@ movie but a kind of continuation , which is playing 20 years after the first movie with the magic inf@@ ant girl . &quot;
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still uncle@@ ar .
&quot; but the director is already certain : Rob Marshall , last with &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; at the cinema . &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; the economy must open up wider outw@@ ard in order to foster growth , President Xi J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday a group that was tas@@ ked with the steering of reform . &quot;
&quot; China should advoc@@ ate foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and promoting reforms will lead to new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the residents &apos; reporting system . &quot;
&quot; following the statement , a list of neg@@ atives will be created , which identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment . &quot;
the system is tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as they assign a greater role to the market in allocation of resources , ensuring a legally regulated business environment and open the market open , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
the government will also cur@@ b controls over the powers transmitted to the companies and ensure companies decide how they manage their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services to them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , foreigners are made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimi@@ zing requirements and facilitate the application process . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a statement issued after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double the mer@@ cury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit value for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and thus expect consumers to take a significantly higher dose of the nervous system .
&quot; the consumer organisation Food@@ watch , who has received a corresponding working paper from the EU , sharp@@ ly critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force of pregnant and inf@@ ants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of Food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the neur@@ onal poison@@ ous for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; large pre@@ dat@@ ors , however , are already so strongly loaded with mer@@ cury that , on the basis of the still existing limit values , approximately 50 percent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ available . &quot;
&quot; in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; but Food@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; trick &quot; , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p , are usually so low , that they already hold the planned top @-@ levels already today . &quot;
&quot; the ab@@ sin@@ king of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de defl@@ ection maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
&quot; mer@@ cury is a heavy metal poison@@ ous for humans , which is strongly enriched by the food chain , above all in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; small amounts can cause particularly low @-@ term damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry reports on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health haz@@ ard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mer@@ cury arrives primarily through coal combustion in the environment .
&quot; according to a written report from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations meet more than six tonnes of mer@@ cury per year , two thirds of the total quantity issued in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish such as in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and region@@ ally crossed , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; quoted from paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , European war@@ nings against mer@@ cury in fish were already one of the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
