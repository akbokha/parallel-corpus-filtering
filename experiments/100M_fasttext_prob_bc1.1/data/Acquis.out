the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied in carrying out the provisions of part I on securing measures .
the objective of the preventive measures established in this Convention is the timely detection of the diver@@ gence of significant quantities of nuclear weapons of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear @-@ explosive bodies for unknown purposes , as well as deter@@ r@@ ence from such a tur@@ no@@ ff due to the risk of early discovery .
in order to enrich the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial confin@@ ement and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical completion of the subsequent tests carried out by the organization is carried out by means of an explanation in which the quantity of material specified for a certain period of time is specified , indicating the accuracy limits for the specified amounts .
in carrying out their verification , the Organization shall make full use of the security system of the Community in accordance with Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Material according to this Convention is based on an outline in material balance zones .
when applying their security measures , the Community of the methods and measures of the following kind will make use of it and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are determined more closely in the supplementary agreements and are advisable :
a ) a measuring system for the determination of quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed core material and inventory levels ;
B ) ass@@ essing the reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and ass@@ essing measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , testing and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) method to evaluate accumulation of non @-@ measured continu@@ ances and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol - and reporting system , which indicates the core material stock for each material account zone and the changes of this stock , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions which ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ures for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures according to this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore treatment .
B ) if ur@@ an@@ ium or th@@ ori@@ um@@ ous material , which the phase of the core fuel cycle described under letter c ) has not yet reached , is introduced into the states , the organization of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is introduced for specifically non@@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaving the core material suitable for the composition and purity of the fuel production or the is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is manufactured or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention shall be terminated for the core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . however , the Community considers that the recovery of core material , which is subject to preventive measures under this Convention , is not possible or desirable from residues , the organization and the community should consult each other on the use of appropriate preventive measures .
B ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for the core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community unanim@@ ously determine that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able .
at the request of the Community , the organisation acqu@@ ires the following core material of preventive measures under this Convention :
a ) Partic@@ ular fis@@ sile material if it is used in grams - or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
( B ) Nu@@ clear material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is above 80 % .
upon request of the Community , the Organization shall release the core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this Convention , from these safegu@@ ards , provided that the whole material quantity delivered in the States is at no point at any time more than
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special foldable material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ying his weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment , which lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ an@@ ium , is calculated by the multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold squ@@ ared of the enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if delivered core material is to be processed , processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the securing measures under this Convention , precau@@ tions for the re @-@ use of the securing measures will be taken on that material .
the Community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements , which is necessary in the scope required for successful and effective provision of the tasks of the Organization under this Convention , in particular determine how to apply the procedures defined in the Convention .
the supplementary agreements may be extended or amended without changing the agreement between the organization and the community .
the Organis@@ ations , the Community and the states undertake every effort to allow these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days of the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report outlined in Article 62 , the Organization shall present a summari@@ zed inventory of the entire core material underlying the securing measures of this Convention , irrespective of its origin , and continues this inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of their subsequent tests .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other
the EW@@ G decided to contribute to the special action program established at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help address the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is imped@@ ed by general resource handling problems .
C ) It is the objective of the EEC and Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States shall be bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted one another on the proposed execution and administration of this agreement and the mi@@ ties to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the organisation of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set forth in this agreement -
the organization arran@@ ges a special account under the term &quot; special payment account , &quot; which consists of the funds made by the Member States in accordance with this Agreement to the special transactions account ; this account is referred to by the Organization as Administrator and used ( in this property , the organization is referred to as &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is handled separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the fees are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest notes of the member state , which are payable on request in the currency of the respective state at the order of the organization as an administrator of the special payment account and to be deposited at the administrative office of the organization in the respective country .
B ) Payment shall be made in two install@@ ments , and the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . of the contribution within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker agreed date ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time agreed between the EEC and the Administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines necessary for parliamentary approval of the annual budget@@ ary plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may , upon request , make payments to the above mentioned dates .
in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes approximately proportional draw on the cash or the school j@@ uri@@ an to cover the expenses for the special loan and to balance the special transactions account in a reasonable manner .
in the granting of these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC :
III ) to the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms and conditions without discount ; and
VII ) to the extent in which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each transaction loan serves to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly exp@@ and@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral approach ) , which is considered , approved and managed according to the methods and practices used for the organisation funded by the organization , with the aim of being considered by the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the means of the special transaction may not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization which are bound by the Bank &apos;s directors or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same re@@ payment terms generally applicable to development loans granted by the organization ; they are therefore ref@@ und@@ able in 50 years in each case .
loan loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for payment of this fee are to be made directly to the organization which it retains .
each loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker in which the origin of the funds is mentioned in particular .
revenues from any special loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services manufactured or furnished ( ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which , in accordance with what the administrator decided at the time of the loan guarantee , could be the recipient of a special loan .
capital re@@ payments from a special loan are made to the special transaction account , and the amount ref@@ unded in this way in the currency of a member state shall be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
the car@@ et@@ aker teaches until full assignment of all special transactions by the EEC on the projects and programmes approved by the directors for the inspection by the directors in preparation and by the directors .
during the period of payment of the special transactions loan , the car@@ et@@ aker will instruc@@ t the EEC quar@@ terly on the development of the special transactions loan and the expendi@@ tures made for this .
the administrator conve@@ ys the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account statement with a statement by the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account .
after a full payment of the special transactions loan , the administrator of the EEC soon conve@@ ys a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction tax .
the car@@ et@@ aker creates and performs suitable records and accounts from which the contributions are made to the special transaction account , the amounts paid from the accounts payable to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to Member States .
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the full edition of the means of the special interaction account , lead to an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions , and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this Agreement .
if this agreement has not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date that the EEC and the Organization may possibly agree upon , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting from it shall become invalid with immediate effect .
if the total amount of the loan granted by the recipients is returned in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and referred back to the Member States , this agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting from it will be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural rules of each party .
the governments of the Member States noti@@ fies the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings in question .
the Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications along with a No@@ tification on the regular authorisation of this Agreement by the EEC to the organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two original scrip@@ tions in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , and each wording is equally authentic .
whereas the agreement in the form of a letter exchange for amend@@ ment of Annex A of Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be closed - HA@@ T issued the following AC@@ TION :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program comprises the creation of a large pilot plant , the J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) project , whose construction and operation are to be transferred to a common enterprise in Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty ( herein@@ after called &quot; Joint J@@ ET &quot; ) .
for several years , Switzerland has been working on research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area in question .
since extensive work has to be carried out until the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to combine their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and to accelerate their respective research , which have attained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis -
this agreement should enable any contracting party to gain the greatest possible benefit by mer@@ ging its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided for both sides of the research , i.@@ e . the cost @-@ competitive electricity generation by using the controlled core fusion reaction to achieve faster results .
to achieve the aim of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Annex I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Program &quot; and &quot; Swiss Programme . &quot;
in order to ensure effective co @-@ operation , the Swiss program acqu@@ ires the long @-@ term objectives and forms of the cooperation of the Eur@@ atom program ; it is thus extended or amended by the organs mentioned in Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement that may include new activities relevant for the Eur@@ atom programme .
every time the contracting parties adopt a new program , this will be replaced by the programs listed in Annex I and II .
the association planned in paragraph 1 is realized by : - adequate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
- Exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and in the third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories working on the Eur@@ atom program ;

I ad@@ ore you to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes and suggest you as an appointment for the entry into force of 1 January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government to the above .
I want to confirm you the receipt of your letter today with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government to the previous one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the Mobili@@ zation of Member States &apos; demands in the context of medium @-@ term financial support
the BI@@ S could close stand by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks submit a corresponding application .
the agreement could be closed up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor to the Mechan@@ ism and within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invo@@ icing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future fund @-@ offs of the member countries .
already now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , to which the BI@@ S would be ready .
with each stand @-@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extension of extensions without being exceeded for a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans , as well as for their event@@ ual extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first conc@@ is@@ ations will not be made before the end of a month after the Stand@@ by agreement is concluded so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liquidity .
the accor@@ ds would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods of time taking into account the bank &apos;s resources , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those used by the BI@@ S at the time on under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S has to obtain the required funds themselves on the market , the interest rate to be applied could reach a maximum that corresponds to the margin hei@@ gh@@ tened by the corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would like to inform me of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could close stand by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks submit a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would like to inform me of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I appeal to you to share with you the consent of the Council of the European Communities for the content of this letter .
in THE conviction that stronger international cooperation should be carried out in such a way that greater liber@@ alisation , stability and expansion in international trade with meat and living animals should be made ;
taking into account the need to avoid serious disrup@@ tions in international trade with beef and living cattle ;
in DER ER@@ K@@ EN@@ TRO@@ NIS the importance of the production of beef and living cattle and trade with these products for the economy of many countries , in particular particular developed countries and developing countries ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; mind@@ ful of their obligations regarding the principles and objectives of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General Agreement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ AT@@ T &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) ; &quot; &quot; &quot;
determined to implement the principles and objectives in the pursuit of the objectives of this agreement , which were agreed in the Tokyo Declaration of Ministers of 14 September 1973 on multi@@ lateral trade negotiations , in particular with regard to the special and more favorable treatment of developing countries -
the objectives of this agreement are , 1 . the extension , more and more liber@@ alisation and stability of the international meat and cattle market by facilit@@ ating the progressive degradation of barriers and restrictions in world trade with beef and living cattle , including measures that promote a distribution of this trade , and by improving the international framework of world trade for the benefit of consumers and producers like imports and export countries ;
2 . to encourage greater international cooperation in all questions of trade with beef and living cattle , in particular with regard to greater ration@@ alisation and a more effective distribution of resources in the international meat industry ;
3 . for the foreign trade of developing countries with beef and living cattle additional advantages to be ensured by taking part among other measures the possibilities to participate in extending the world trade with these products : a ) promoting long @-@ term price stability in the framework of an expanding world market for beef and living cattle and
( B ) Pro@@ mot@@ ing the maintenance and improvement of the proceeds of beef and living cattle of developing countries ,
and this to achieve additional revenues by ensuring long @-@ term stability of beef and living cattle ;

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olo@@ g containing the antibody or another substance on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena shall not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured twice in a suitable medium by di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be investigated .
ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated excluding the volume of the blood cells in@@ undation in the total volume .
in case of anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has established standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time of standards .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most species is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ally observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in an er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter gives di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mix within a series in which a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the international standard preparations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of unknown re@@ agent in international units ( See Bulletin who O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B will contain 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Dental Laboratory of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative ti@@ tr@@ ation of the International Standard Office Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; Anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall be retained for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in a liquid form according to the label lies at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date specified on the label for dry re@@ agents is based on the results of the attempts to exp@@ ire ; it must be approved by the state regul@@ ators .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ d at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to prevent bacterial growth , the competent governmental authority can determine that the agent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements of specific@@ ity and efficacy .
sera human origins for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of flu@@ e or dissolved serum .

re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent located in a container is sufficient not only to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all production stages and checks of re@@ agents for blood group measurement .
proper samples from all re@@ agents have to be stored for a long time from the laboratory , until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of them represent an effective portion , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are group@@ ed into three groups following the origin of their active component .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origins alone contain substances of human origin or that animal or vegetable re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
each container is a black on white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
