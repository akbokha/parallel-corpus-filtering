<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other</seg>
<seg id="730">The EWG decided to contribute to the special action program established at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation in order to help address the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is impeded by general resource handling problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the objective of the EEC and Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States shall be bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement, and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted one another on the proposed execution and administration of this agreement and the mities to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the organisation of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set forth in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization arranges a special account under the term "special payment account," which consists of the funds made by the Member States in accordance with this Agreement to the special transactions account; this account is referred to by the Organization as Administrator and used (in this property, the organization is referred to as "caretaker"), and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is handled separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The fees are to be paid as follows: a) The payment is made in the form of cash or non-interest notes of the member state, which are payable on request in the currency of the respective state at the order of the organization as an administrator of the special payment account and to be deposited at the administrative office of the organization in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) Payment shall be made in two installments, and the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. of the contribution within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the caretaker agreed date;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time agreed between the EEC and the Administrator, taking into account the deadlines necessary for parliamentary approval of the annual budgetary plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each Member State may, upon request, make payments to the above mentioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">In accordance with the usual procedures of the organization, the caretaker takes approximately proportional draw on the cash or the school jurian to cover the expenses for the special loan and to balance the special transactions account in a reasonable manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the granting of these loans, the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) to the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms and conditions without discount; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) to the extent in which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each transaction loan serves to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly expandable development program or project (including a sectoral approach), which is considered, approved and managed according to the methods and practices used for the organisation funded by the organization, with the aim of being considered by the letter b) of the preamble to this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The means of the special transaction may not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization which are bound by the Bank's directors or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from section 4, special transactions are subject to the same repayment terms generally applicable to development loans granted by the organization; they are therefore refundable in 50 years in each case.</seg>
<seg id="748">Loan loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts for payment of this fee are to be made directly to the organization which it retains.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the caretaker in which the origin of the funds is mentioned in particular.</seg>
<seg id="751">Revenues from any special loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services manufactured or furnished (ii) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which, in accordance with what the administrator decided at the time of the loan guarantee, could be the recipient of a special loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments from a special loan are made to the special transaction account, and the amount refunded in this way in the currency of a member state shall be remitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">The caretaker teaches until full assignment of all special transactions by the EEC on the projects and programmes approved by the directors for the inspection by the directors in preparation and by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of payment of the special transactions loan, the caretaker will instruct the EEC quarterly on the development of the special transactions loan and the expenditures made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator conveys the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization a detailed account statement with a statement by the external auditor of the organization to this account.</seg>
<seg id="756">After a full payment of the special transactions loan, the administrator of the EEC soon conveys a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction tax.</seg>
<seg id="757">The caretaker creates and performs suitable records and accounts from which the contributions are made to the special transaction account, the amounts paid from the accounts payable to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the repayments to Member States.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretaker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">For this purpose, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the caretaker up to the full edition of the means of the special interaction account, lead to an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account, the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions, and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement has not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date that the EEC and the Organization may possibly agree upon, the agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting from it shall become invalid with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total amount of the loan granted by the recipients is returned in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and referred back to the Member States, this agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting from it will be terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
