this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the packages ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. chao@@ tic thinking and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al problems when oral consumption of the medicine is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be applied or the melting tablets are used in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who use other medicines at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this imp@@ airs the transmission of signals between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which enable communication between neur@@ ons and neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is believed to be a &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent , acts as the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its re@@ occurring .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms was examined in three studies over up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared with a plac@@ ebo in two studies of 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar disorders , suffering from increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence in 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy Inj@@ ection Solution was compared in a study on 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , suffering from increased un@@ rest , with the treatment of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was examined based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution for taking into consideration .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term clinical symptoms more effectively than plac@@ ebo .
furthermore , up to 74 weeks of plac@@ ebo , A@@ bili@@ fy was able to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common A@@ bili@@ fy effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controll@@ able sugar@@ s ) , di@@ zz@@ iness ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( increased s@@ ali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of abili@@ fy in treating schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes insist@@ ed on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , out@@ weigh the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . appro@@ ving the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy across the European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who predominantly had man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes responded to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
an increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
a lower initial dose should be taken into account with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increased risk of suicide using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ cel@@ eri@@ ed and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia appearing during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
if patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy experience signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for undesi@@ rable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no accurate risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents that allow direct compar@@ isons .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ uria , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar deficiency because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is recommended when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ ers , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , although this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 of extensive metabolism .
considering the common application of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should be out@@ weigh@@ ed for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be lifted to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy are administered , can be expected with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ met@@ amor@@ phi@@ c / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ met@@ amor@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used in pregnancy due to the lack of data for safety in humans and due to the concerns in reproductive studies of the animal , unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , like other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned against using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative impact on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole underwent a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia , compared with patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with high @-@ risk therapy .
man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study , more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment was 17.@@ 6 % for those suffering from lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase , more than 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , with potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects associated with an anti @-@ psycho@@ tic therapy , and their occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and sei@@ zur@@ es , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical studies and since the market launch inad@@ vert@@ ently or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without cause of death .
although there is no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and D3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a and 5@@ HT@@ A receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ ors .
with the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers , posit@@ ron @-@ emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor li@@ g@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ d@@ us and at the coup .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , in Week 52 the share of respon@@ der patients who retained a response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at hal@@ operi@@ dol .
a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in a random@@ ly controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of approx . 5.@@ 6 kg was observed in significantly less patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed an efficacy in week 3 versus plac@@ ebo , comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a similar proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , which in part did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superi@@ ority to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzymes are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ulation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ lam@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l for extensive metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and about 146 hours in poor &apos; poor &apos; metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a shift @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any clin@@ ically significant differences in respect of eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with class C liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions to their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ rop@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated applications , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not recognise any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical applications .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent sub @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the middle Ste@@ ady State Ex@@ pos@@ ure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
furthermore , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the Hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the G@@ alle of apes after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average daily dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found in the human g@@ all have no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of apes , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors .
in a random@@ ly controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of approx . 5.@@ 6 kg was observed in significantly less patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) .

as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be terminated and begin with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
to increase res@@ or@@ ption and to minim@@ ise vari@@ ability , injection into the cran@@ ios@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by b@@ yp@@ assing adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines already applied for maintenance or acute treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a secondary oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy processed tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution for taking .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
tests for the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( either prescribed or illegal ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ak@@ cel@@ eri@@ ed and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia appearing during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ uria , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar deficiency because of combination compounds , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dan was higher compared to the after @-@ long administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study , in which healthy volunteers were used in@@ tra @-@ muscular ( 15 mg dose ) as one @-@ time intra@@ muscular one and the same time they received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tra @-@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ ers , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , although this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be lifted to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy .

the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : commonly ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ effects in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under plac@@ ebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those in lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase , more than 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , with potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects associated with an anti @-@ psycho@@ tic therapy , and their occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and sei@@ zur@@ es , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of ag@@ gregation / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms with regard to det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al problems compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed mean improvement from bas@@ eline on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gregation , a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined on account of a decreased patient number .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( or@@ ally ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , in Week 52 the share of respon@@ der patients who retained a response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( or@@ ally ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at hal@@ operi@@ dol .
a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ sed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in a random@@ ly controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . 5.@@ 6 kg was observed in significantly less patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) .
111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , which partially had no psycho@@ tic or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superi@@ ority to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % larger than the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time required to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15 - or 5 times higher than the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
in studies of reproductive toxic@@ ity following IV application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns resulted in mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( or@@ ally ) for security har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not allow any particular dangers for human beings .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; thus they have limited or no importance for clinical applications .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent sub @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 @-@ times the middle @-@ state @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
furthermore , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the bile after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times average at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 81 @-@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the middle @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , some of which had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine in three quarters earlier .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole application or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
overall , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
only patients who have been treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer gave no difference to the efficacy indicators such as time to wor@@ sen@@ ing of the disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it must also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients where the first treatment was no longer considered to be more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and that it does not have to be given with other medicines compared to other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted a permit to the Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited company to transport Abra@@ x@@ ane across the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in the case of Neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 , treatment should be interrupted until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired kidney function were performed and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of ren@@ al function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in patients , no further Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils increase to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the plat@@ el@@ et number has risen to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
whereas a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not proven , cardiac occur@@ ren@@ ces in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with early anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying cardiovascular disease .
if the patient receives nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane , these can be treated with the usual anti @-@ inflammatory and con@@ sti@@ pi@@ ents .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is inevitable .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not create a child during and up to six months after treatment .
male patients should be advised against the treatment of a sperm conservation , as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible un@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the traffic ti@@ ghtness and the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al Phase III study once every three weeks .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most prominent ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was fast reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows adverse events associated with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in every dose and indication ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ t@@ tal hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease :
dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , hur@@ ting g@@ ums , loose stool , o@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the lower abdom@@ en , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , neck pain , muscle aches , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in the skel@@ etal muscul@@ ature , back pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and there was no caus@@ al connection with these events established .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active substance that supports the inter@@ linking of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ a and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their poly@@ meri@@ zation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and mit@@ otic membrane functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 receptor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ini@@ zing protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the tumor area .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two random@@ ised untreated studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised phase III comparative study .
in one study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer for 30 minutes .
this multic@@ entre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 , either in the form of a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 , 30 minutes in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study 64 % of patients had a negative overall condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metastatic disease and 19 % metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound at bas@@ eline based on the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was measured in clinical studies .
exposure to drug exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 Accor@@ ding to intraven@@ ous dispens@@ ing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or turn@@ out of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute injection of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values following a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane application ( 43 % ) than after a solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is metaboli@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ di@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clear@@ ances .
however , only a few data are available to patients at the age of 75 , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
chemical and physical stability was proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected against light by 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and , as with other potentially toxic substances , caution should be taken when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is slowly inj@@ ected into a Abra@@ x@@ ane water bottle over a period of at least 1 minute ( 0.@@ 9 % ) .
after complete en@@ core of the solution , the water bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure good wet@@ ting of the solids .
then the water bottle should be slowly and carefully sw@@ ung and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes until complete removal of the powder is carried out .
if any counter@@ f@@ eit or sm@@ el@@ utri@@ ents are visible , the water bottle must be inver@@ ted gently to achieve complete residual suspension before the application .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal product &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood glucose levels in which complications may occur in the context of blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood loss is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected .
treatment with Rem@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is displayed .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be performed by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided that they have received appropriate instructions .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the emo@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron levels of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency , or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that em@@ powers them to form epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .
in the case of a major study of 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia , fl@@ amed was compared with the reference medicinal product .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected with E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at least eight weeks before they were either converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the change in h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period between 25 and 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of fl@@ amed fl@@ amed fl@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were studied at 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia , the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values of patients that were converted to de@@ bil@@ lon were maintained to the same extent as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ inging mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
de@@ bil@@ lon should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
fl@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the regulations of the European Union , evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces fl@@ amed up will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Medi@@ ca medicinal P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for the marketing of Ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia in the on@@ set of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in the case of planned larger surgical interventions ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery in adults without iron deficiency in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is to be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program .
the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients where the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and overall illness burden ; therefore , the physician &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of illness is necessary .
a rise in ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in patients with or below the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
given this ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the sustained ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose needed for controlling an@@ emia and an@@ emia .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using an intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , sex and overall illness burden ; therefore , the physician &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of illness is necessary .
given this ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose needed for control of the an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ ular number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be kept three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the index number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l is increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg , the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of re@@ inde@@ ers has increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
on the other hand , the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the index number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l over the bas@@ eline is unlikely and the treatment should be stopped .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood @-@ preserved foods is required , should be obtained twice a week in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery .
as early as possible , the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program begins , so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the fl@@ amed treatment .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgical procedure and on the day of intervention ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa should pre@@ oper@@ atively pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg each in 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation .
patients who fall ill under treatment with some er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n in er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a fl@@ amed or another er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment , inst@@ able ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep v@@ ein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
the application of epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients with a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral vascular disease , car@@ oti@@ d or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely reported about the occurrence of an antibody medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n .
in patients with sudden loss of function , defined as reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ qui@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes of a failure ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium toxic@@ ity , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the antibody index is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes are normal , and if no other cause of an active loss is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be considered .
the immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity data for sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration in section 4.2 should not be exceeded .
in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating active substances ( ESA ) with a ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were given .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the application of epo@@ et@@ ines if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased via the concentration required to control the an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , the upper limit of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration in section 4.2 should not be exceeded .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
for tumor patients with chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n response should be taken into account for the assessment of the therapy efficiency of epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .
if the H@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1@@ m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with paragraph 4.2 ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dose adaptation with the aim of keeping the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to apply re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the participation of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients with a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the beginning of epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa therapy .
patients undergoing a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vascular diseases , especially with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa for patients with an initial h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl can be an increased risk of post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic / vascular events .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine was not proven to improve overall survival for tumor patients or to reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy reduced if h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration was targeted at 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l )
if epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dosage should be adapted to the rising hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there is no indication of an interaction between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F concerning hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
about th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mb@@ oses , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , retin@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n treatment , as well as patients with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .
the most frequent side effect during treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n treatment , patients with cardiovascular disease can lead to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations .
the genetically determined epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ lic and is identical with the endo@@ genous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients with regard to amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content .
with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells it could be shown that epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa specifically stimulates er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ oc@@ esis .
3@@ 89 patients with ha@@ emo@@ bla@@ stom@@ as ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ ost@@ s ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 more ) .
1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 breast carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 174 g@@ yn@@ a@@ ecological tumours , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 8@@ 02 patients with ha@@ emo@@ bla@@ stom@@ as .
survival and progression have been studied in five large controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n and control patients .
in these studies , in the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n , an@@ a@@ emia was consistent with an@@ a@@ emia due to various frequent malign@@ an@@ cies , significantly higher mortality compared to controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and associated complications in re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n and in controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application demonstrated a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels , which are achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no accumulation : serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients treated with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .
14 In animal experimental studies with approximate 20 times of the weekly dose recommended in humans , epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa led to reduced federal body weight , a delay of the oscill@@ ation and an increase in fet@@ al mortality .
these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumour tissue samples , which are of uncertain Sig@@ ni@@ fi@@ kan@@ z for the clinical situation .

• if you suffer from a heart attack or stroke within one month before your treatment • if you suffer from an unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or reinforced chest pain ) , there is a risk of a drop in blood in the veins ( deep v@@ ein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) - if for example , such a blood graf@@ ting has occurred .
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral vascular disease of the oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you suffered recently a heart attack or stroke .
during treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which re@@ builds after further treatment .
your doctor may perform regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , dissolution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid deficiency should be considered and treated with fl@@ amed prior to beginning treatment .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n was reported very rarely on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ induced er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia , it will ab@@ ort your treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best handled .
therefore , de@@ bil@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of increased or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may consider an interruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels fall back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney weakness and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or st@@ ow@@ age signs caused by inadequate heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a particular value .
according to the present findings , treatment of an@@ a@@ emia in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be considered for the evaluation of the effectiveness of fl@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your red blood dy@@ es ( h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your fl@@ amed dose accordingly to keep the risk of blood bo@@ unc@@ ing ( th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be very carefully weigh@@ ed against the advantages derived from the treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e or if in the past th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events have occurred ( e.g. a deep v@@ ein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
if you are cancer patient , keep in mind that Ab@@ se@@ amed works like a growth factor for blood cells and , in some circumstances , neg@@ atively affect the tumour .
if you have a larger orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the start of treatment .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood graf@@ ting after the surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have used / used recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may need to arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia ( an@@ emia ) refers to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the treatment success and make sure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value .
once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses of fl@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice weekly , distributed to two equally large inj@@ ections .

acet@@ one is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that br@@ ittle bones ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ tures ( frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who recently suffered a lower trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture such as H@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
additionally patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of acet@@ one can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the disease , Ac@@ tis@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ tu@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a portion of the data for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate ac@@ last@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 older women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years was examined .
the second study included 2 127 male and female oste@@ opor@@ osis women who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was examined .
in two studies , Ac@@ tu@@ a was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in serum ( an enzyme that metaboli@@ zes bone substance ) normal@@ ised in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % compared to bas@@ eline .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ tis@@ a ( excluding other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to plac@@ ebo .
in comparison to patients under Ac@@ tis@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) with plac@@ ebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under Ac@@ tis@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ tu@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
acet@@ one may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ics or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ reli@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions at the in@@ fusion point and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ tu@@ a provides information for doctors who prescri@@ be Ac@@ tis@@ a to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains instructions on how to use the medicine , as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the transport of Ac@@ pay@@ a to the European Union .

oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in men with an increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous 5 mg Ac@@ tis@@ a in@@ fusion is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ tis@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ tu@@ a , a long re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of acet@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ la@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ tu@@ a can be reduced by application of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after application of acet@@ last@@ a .
patients with kidney function disorders ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ tu@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this group of patients is available .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ tu@@ a are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data is missing for safety and efficacy .
in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , Ac@@ tu@@ a is not recommended because only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing mort@@ ad@@ an@@ a@@ emia is to be treated with sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D before commen@@ cement of therapy ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid implementation of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone conversion , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ tu@@ a ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , corresponding twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of acet@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental examination with appropriate preventive denti@@ stry .
for patients who need dental procedures , there is no data available whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of acet@@ one can be reduced by application of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after application of acet@@ one ( see paragraph 4.2 ) .
cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported as a serious side effect were increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ tu@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) adverse drug response are listed in table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ a was associated with ren@@ al dysfunction , which was associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured per year before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a restricted ren@@ al function were in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the plac@@ ebo and plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ tu@@ a versus 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the assessment of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal swa@@ p area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , were observed in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ tu@@ a in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ tu@@ a in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
in addition , all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study of preventing clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get trials ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on the prevention of clinical frac@@ tures after a l@@ itt@@ y hip frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ tu@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions following the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ a acid in a large clinical trial were reported on local reactions at the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area has been reported , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ o@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of the reports relates to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental procedures .
7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients treated oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area in a patient treated with plac@@ ebo and plac@@ ebo .
in the case of over@@ dosing , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation of calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be compensated .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years ) has been indicated with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ score for the fem@@ ur ≤ -@@ 1.5 and at least two mild or medium @-@ heavy existing spine frac@@ tures or a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ score for the fem@@ ur ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spine frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric ed@@ dy frac@@ tures Ac@@ tu@@ a decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures after one year ( see Table 2 ) .
ac@@ aci@@ an @-@ treated patients from 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ tu@@ a showed an equally lasting effect over three years which resulted in reduced risk for hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ tu@@ a increased bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ c acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.1 % , of the scar@@ let by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with acet@@ ylene ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) , bone biop@@ sies were taken from the pel@@ vic body one year after the third annual dose of oste@@ opor@@ osis .
a micro@@ computer@@ ised tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and the retention of tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture in patients treated with Ac@@ tu@@ a .
bone replacement marker The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pep@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study duration .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ tu@@ a reduced B@@ SAP by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was kept at 28 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mortality rate was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ tu@@ a , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , compared to plac@@ ebo , BM@@ D increased the overall th@@ igh and scar@@ let at all times .
in comparison to plac@@ ebo @-@ treatment , the Ac@@ tu@@ a treatment led to an increase of BM@@ D by 5.4 % at the total r@@ ump and 4.3 % of the plac@@ ebo arm compared to plac@@ ebo .
clinical efficacy in men In H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study 5@@ 08 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ a compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 study ) , the once annual administration of acet@@ ylene in comparison to the weekly gift of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ t@@ a was examined in patients at the age of 30 with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly mild to moderate severe Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( medium serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.6 @-@ fold up to 3.0 times age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate acid compared to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily for 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influences was observed in comparison to the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ tu@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at after 6 months .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ ses at the end of the six @-@ month primary study ( response to therapy ) could be included in the follow @-@ up phase .
from 143 with Ac@@ tu@@ a and 107 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response at 141 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate could be maintained during an average follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes continuous in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients yiel@@ ded the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent .
then the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the highest value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h followed by a long period of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearance from the large circul@@ atory cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β @-@ 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body Clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration at 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a reduced clearance of metaboli@@ zed substances by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clear@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) in 64 patients studied .
this results in a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function disorder , down to a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance down to 35 ml / min , does not require dosage adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
since severe kidney failure ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) is restricted to limited data , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ single @-@ acting intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0,@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
in studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C are 6@@ times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub @-@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous use , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats was obtained by taking doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ x the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , corresponds ) , well tolerated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects on other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection site occurred .
the most common findings in repeated use studies was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
in rats , ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity was observed in doses ranging from 0,2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
in rab@@ bits , no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity at 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of low serum @-@ calcium levels .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; usually 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .

according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for human medic@@ aments , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current predic@@ tions on safety , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days if an important milestone ( for drug vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was reached .
phen@@ olic A@@ ci@@ d is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the male Pa@@ get of the bone .
dec@@ lining blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction takes place too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ tu@@ a works by normal@@ ising the bone structure , ensuring a normal bone formation and thus gives strength to the bone .
if you are undergoing dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ tis@@ a .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have used it recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
for your doctor it is especially important to know if you take medicinal products from which it is known that they will damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ tu@@ a together with food and beverages , you are concerned that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you need enough fluids before and after treatment with Ac@@ tu@@ a .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to do the administration of acet@@ ylene for two or more weeks following the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
since Ac@@ tu@@ a works for a long time , you may need to take another dose only after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood will not be too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get you can work for more than one year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ tu@@ a is missed , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before completing the therapy with Ac@@ tu@@ a Falls you are considering completing treatment with Ac@@ tu@@ a , please take your next medical appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion perform very frequently ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ tu@@ a .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ tu@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms as you have received ac@@ last@@ a .
physical signs due to a too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b@@ ness , especially in the area around the mouth .

persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or at the jaw were reported above all in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if one of the listed adverse events will affect you significantly or you will notice side effects that are not listed in this usage information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; usually 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , it is recommended to perform an in@@ fusion of acet@@ ylene for two or more weeks following the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of acet@@ last@@ a patients need to be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid insertion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone conversion , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic , transi@@ ent , hypo@@ kal@@ ic@@ a@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ tu@@ a .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of acet@@ one .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ tu@@ a .
if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please read the packages ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
compli@@ a is also applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , who suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • who are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more I
in addition , four studies were carried out to over 7@@ ,000 patients in which compli@@ ments were used as a suppor@@ tive remedy for setting the smoking in comparison to a plac@@ ebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the studies on setting the smoking did not show uniform results so that the effect of compli@@ a was difficult to assess in this area of application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of compli@@ a found during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory infections .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or being treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it may increase the risk of depression and can , among other things , provoke a small minority of patients su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts .
caution is recommended with simultaneous use of compli@@ a with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for the application in HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , to@@ eli@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or clari@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . LN
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of compli@@ a in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight
drugs used in patients who need it for health reasons and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing information packages for patients and physicians ) , and around the Ar@@ z
in addition to diet and exercise for treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also exhibit one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) .
compli@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to lack of data on efficacy and safety .
depres@@ sive symptoms or changes in mood with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts with up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefits of treatment in an individual case out@@ weigh the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
it is also present in patients who - in addition to obesity - do not have any visible risks , can lead to depres@@ sive reactions .
relatives or other nearby persons must be noted that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and immediately get medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ derly patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not adequately shown .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke , etc . ) were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant less than 6 months ago .
ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ( St. John &apos;s wort ) has not been studied , it is assumed that the simultaneous application of potent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors the plasma concentration of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant
it has examined the most overweight patients as well as in patients with an obesity , and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in further indications .
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows adverse effects of plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in patients treated for weight reduction and accompanying metabolic diseases .
it was statisti@@ cally significantly higher than the corresponding plac@@ ebo ( for undesi@@ rable effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for undesi@@ rable effects &lt; 1 % ) . NG At the evaluation of side effects the following abund@@ ances are found :
very frequently ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0.@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ;
in a case study , where a limited number of people were given one @-@ time charges of up to 300 mg , only slight symptoms were observed .
the patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
n weight reduction after one year amounted to 20 mg 6,5 kg , relative to the initial value , compared to 1.6 kg for the plac@@ ebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg , CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4.4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
the patients treated with compli@@ a 20 mg and 1.2 kg in the plac@@ ebo group ( difference -@@ 3,@@ 8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4.4 , -@@ 3.3 ; p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
after 2 years , the difference in total weight reduction between compli@@ a and plac@@ ebo -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
9 Weight reduction and other risk factors In studies in patients without diabetes , in which a mixed population of patients with
on Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , an average tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de decrease was seen from 6.@@ 9 % ( bas@@ eline tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des 1.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.@@ 8 %
in a second study in patients with an obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , absolute change in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) after 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 below plac@@ ebo
the percentage of patients receiving H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the difference between the mean weight changes between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the plac@@ ebo @-@ group was 3.8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n ei@@ m Ar@@ z
the Ste@@ ady State plasma levels were reached after 13 days ( C@@ max = 196 ± 28.@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; C@@ trou@@ gh = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14,@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 26@@ 8 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml ) .
food influence : he subjects , who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant either in@@ timi@@ dating or after a fat @-@ rich meal , showed a 67 % increased C@@ max or 48 % increased n@@ g AU@@ C in the case of dietary intake .
patients with black skin color can have up to 31 % lower C@@ max and a 43 % lower AU@@ C than patients of other ethnic populations .
n @-@ population mac@@ ular analysis ( age range 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year @-@ old patient has 21 % higher C@@ max and 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old .
5.3 Pre@@ ventive data on the safety of adverse events which were not observed in clinical studies , but which occurred n@@ g in animals after exposure to the human therapeutic field , were evaluated as potentially relevant for the clinical application :
in some , however , not in all cases the beginning of the conv@@ ul@@ sions seems to be related to proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with the animals .
if Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or cycle disorders .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study on rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by means of lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behavior or memory .

abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . it can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not shown . • It can be used together with another diabetes drug ( dual therapy ) .
it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( particularly obes@@ e patients ) who cannot be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dosage .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ resin or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ y@@ otrop@@ ic acid or insulin can be maintained with the on@@ set of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , which allows type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was examined in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos has led to a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels have been lowered when dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg doses .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of adding an additional dose of Ac@@ tos to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin in lowering H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values decreased by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional gift of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who took Ac@@ tos additionally instructed insulin to decrease H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were blur@@ red vision , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ theses ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other ingredients , even in patients with liver problems , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the transport of Ac@@ tos across the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
for the application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other evidence of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values will be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ resolved nausea , vom@@ iting , abdominal pain , ti@@ redness , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values must be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be continued should be pres@@ ided by clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are presented .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which can be caused by fatty deposits and is associated with fluid retention in some cases .
a minor reduction of the average ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) was found in the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral double or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or as a dual combination therapy with insulin receive the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
following the market launch , the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ole indicators , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , was reported on an occurrence or deterioration of di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a reduction in visual acuity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the appearance of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report on visual acuity disorders ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological investigation should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence amounted to 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wishes to receive a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not exercise relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the fact that , under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insulin resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the uter@@ us decreases , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not estimated from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary alteration of the tower and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents exceeding the three times the upper limit of the normal range were similar to plac@@ ebo , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ otrop@@ ic .
in an outcome study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or respectively .
since its market launch it has rarely been reported about con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients were treated in groups treated with comparison medication .
in over a period of 3.5 years of Pro@@ Active study , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one appears to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it has been shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is reducing glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose degradation in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ xis as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time to follow the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ xis ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study lasting more than 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient with insulin for three months were random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to those who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical studies more than one year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ent compared to the bas@@ eline values showed consistently under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small study of type 2 di@@ ab@@ etic patients for 18 weeks .
in most clinical studies , compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as slightly but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated LD@@ L cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced total plas@@ mat@@ o@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ xis and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level .
in comparison to Pla@@ z@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one whereas low levels were observed under met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ xis .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the n@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both with an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ised in groups who received either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the existing anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic and cardiovascular treatment .
after oral appliance pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the peak concentrations of un@@ modified Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in the plasma usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to the effectiveness of about three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , it was possible to demonstrate that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have a relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the crop ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma elimination period of un@@ altered Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and that of the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced ren@@ al function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral Clear@@ ance of the parent substance are similar .
toxic@@ ological studies were consistent with mice , rats , dogs and apes after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric cardiac hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the hyp@@ er insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the uter@@ us are reduced , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the bladder epitheli@@ um were induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ole indi@@ a led to an increased incidence of col@@ onic tum@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence amounted to 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ xis were investigated .
in clinical studies more than 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ent compared to the bas@@ eline values showed consistently under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
in a study of 20 weeks Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the n@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this both over an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
although the study missed the target with regard to its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ mortal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .

in a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients receiving treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed an increased incidence of bone frac@@ tures in women .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is normally used once or twice daily , if a fast initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , where the body is unable to effectively use insulin .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane lead to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c spi@@ eg@@ els indicating that blood sugar levels were lowered as much as with another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( see the full list of the packages ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the treatment of diabetes .
October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a licence for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane across the European Union .
pre@@ mixed is@@ insulin products are normally used once or twice daily , if a fast initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , can perceive the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( producer ) , type of insulin ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analo@@ gon ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin @-@ animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage .
if a dosage adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling across several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such trips can lead to insulin and meals being used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions during the therapy and ask his patients to always ask for other medications taken from them .
4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a not sufficiently controlled di@@ ab@@ et@@ esis , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fru@@ stration in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent brain function disorders and even death .
nervous system diseases - Periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with discomfort known as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and usually reversible .
5 . intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement of the blood sugar level can , however , be associated with a temporary deterioration in di@@ ab@@ etic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and the sub@@ cut@@ aneous tissue joint - li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy On the injection site may arise a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy if failed to change the punc@@ ture points within the injection area .
general illnesses and complaints at the site of the administration - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , sor@@ eness and ha@@ emat@@ oma at the injection site ) can occur .
diseases of the immune system - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rarely - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ on@@ euro@@ tic e@@ dem@@ a , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and f@@ ain@@ ting / un@@ consciousness .
hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia may develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can be treated by oral supplements of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar@@ s , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an instructed hel@@ per or by glucose , which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum amount is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total amount of action is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin @-@ products with quick and delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of split ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human @-@ insul@@ ine molecule were considered ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by the spl@@ itting are active .
based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ rop@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular dangers for humans .
it is recommended - after removing the Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane water bottle from the refrigerator - to increase the insulin temperature at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before being res@@ us@@ ed@@ ul@@ ted according to the instructions for the first use .

this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
the in@@ effective ingredient in Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced using the method of &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology &quot; :

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S authorization for the transport of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id across the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin which is rapidly acting needs to be raised first , then the amount of long @-@ acting insulin .
3 If a dosage adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling across several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such trips can lead to insulin and meals being used or taken at other times .
5 General illnesses and complaints at the site of administration - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , sor@@ eness and ha@@ emat@@ oma at the injection site ) can occur .
di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar@@ s , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an instructed hel@@ per or by glucose , which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
clinical trials in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 di@@ ab@@ etic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ di@@ ab@@ etic patients ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum amount is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total length of action amounts to approximately 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) of di@@ ab@@ etic children ( aged between 6 and 12 ) and adolescents ( aged between 13 and 17 ) .
the data is limited , but suggests that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .
in@@ fusion systems with Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in concentrations of 0.@@ 05 I.@@ E. / ml - 1.0 I.@@ E. / ml insulin in the in@@ fusion fluid 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de , 5 % D glucose and 10 % D glucose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chlori@@ de are stable at room temperature for 24 hours at room temperature .
11 If a dosage adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling across several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such trips can lead to insulin and meals being used or taken at other times .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients showing signs of crystalline formation including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or lymp@@ h nodes ( &quot; stones &quot; that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 m@@ g. a day .
during the first treatment months there may still be g@@ out attacks , so it is recommended that patients with Aden@@ ur@@ ic do not take any further medicine to prevent g@@ out attacks during the first six months of treatment .
the medicine is not recommended in children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because they were not examined for these groups .
in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do @-@ medication ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year at 7@@ 62 patients each year .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients whose blood acid levels in the blood was below 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients receiving Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once daily received 120 mg , in the last three measurements a urine acid level in the blood of below 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also contain a higher risk of side @-@ effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already resulted in bur@@ ial deposits ( including one from the medical history known or currently present g@@ out node and / or a g@@ out arthritis ) .
if the acid acid levels are still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function restriction , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated until now ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .

in a study involving test persons 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily showed an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible low inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at to the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids , the magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delays the absorption of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease of the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies can not be caused by side effects of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at for pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not prec@@ lu@@ de direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic or fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or performing dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure AD@@ DIN@@ ER@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ oid group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1,4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a dec@@ eased heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) adverse events reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical trials there were no severe skin ras@@ hes or serious hyper@@ sensitivity reactions observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 3 years , 57 patients up to 4 years long with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the related events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in phase 3 trials ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups altogether more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :
diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ es@@ thesia , eye @-@ catching EC@@ G , cou@@ gh@@ ing , short@@ ness of breath , der@@ si@@ tis , kidney failure , erectile dysfunction , increase of TS@@ H concentration in the blood , reduction of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in the number of white blood cells .
active mechanism ur@@ ic acid is the end product of the pur@@ in@@ metabolism in humans and arises as part of the reaction process Hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for in vitro escap@@ ement , which lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area .
clinical trial results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study , as described below ) , which were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients suffering from hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly specified serv@@ um acid levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ atine @-@ value at the beginning of studies of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the commonly used dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum cre@@ atine contents &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summari@@ zed for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
lowering of the serum resin content to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit visit to week 2 and maintained permanently over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum cre@@ atine levels &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were given 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment The AP@@ EX @-@ study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( i.e. h ) .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC reached the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage return of serum di@@ ure@@ tic acid concentrations in subjects , despite their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum di@@ ure@@ tic concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of studies ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data gathered in the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum concentration levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of rheum@@ atism in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against g@@ gering ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the lymp@@ h nodes by month 24 .
elevated TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased propor@@ tionally after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg doses .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max amounts to approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage drop in the acid acid concentration if this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at lies in the range between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration range obtained with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ el@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found as imm@@ utable f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose was found in the chair as imm@@ utable f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , Ac@@ yl@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
specific patient groups of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal ren@@ al function .
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately 1.8 @-@ times of 7.5 m and h / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g and h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 Li@@ ver Dys@@ function After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ - Pu@@ gh classification B ) Li@@ ver dysfunction altered the C@@ max and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites not significantly compared to normal liver function subjects .
no significant changes were observed with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites after taking multiple oral dos@@ ages of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , approximately 11 times the exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of specific pur@@ in@@ metaboli@@ zation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was noted that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
in case of high doses , which lay approximately in 4 @-@ times the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , which was accompanied by a reduction in the re@@ aring performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , which amounted to roughly 4,@@ 3 times and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which amounted to approximately 13 times the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , did not result in ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder where bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of a low vitamin D level .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down until after the first dietary intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 can be used separately from each other in medicines approved in the European Union , the company submitted data origin@@ ating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who only received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the same as the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , ul@@ c@@ ers ( Ul@@ cer@@ a ) of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , tap@@ ered abdom@@ en ( infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as sau@@ res .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 , or any of the other ingredients , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied .
it may not be used for o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus diseases , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd. a permit for the marketing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE across the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or taking of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• After opening the day AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is to be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not lie down before the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
e.g. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ la@@ sty , only be given under special care ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions such as e@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ lines , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions and patients should be advised to obtain the medicine at the occurrence of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ glob@@ alizing heart@@ burn and seek medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of serious es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue taking it after symptoms that indicate es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , commonly associated with a tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regi@@ men predominantly contain intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available to indicate whether a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate treatment in patients with a surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning of each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet next morning while taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned for the day of the week .
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE prior to treatment .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some oral medicines can affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate before taking other drugs ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not performed , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken together with a large number of commonly prescribed medicines without having clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports originate from cancer patients , but also reported on oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
however , taking the serum cal@@ ci@@ um up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment arms with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate occurrence of an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , e@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

the main effect of 1,@@ 25 D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 is the increase of the intestinal res@@ or@@ ption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of serum calcium , the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption .
in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia , weakness of proxim@@ al muscul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ ie can lead to a further increased risk of falls and oste@@ opor@@ osis .

al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate studies The therapeutic pe@@ dic@@ ation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multic@@ enter study on post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the Phase III studies , the average BM@@ D asc@@ ents with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day in relation to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % versus plac@@ ebo 6,@@ 2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the BM@@ D asc@@ ents of the spine and the Tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to uph@@ old ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily for either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new cycl@@ ed frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus plac@@ ebo 15 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption referring to an intraven@@ ous dose of reference was the average oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night fasting and two hours before commen@@ cing a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability correspon@@ dingly increased to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) did not lead to a clin@@ ically meaningful change in the oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 Distribution studies on rats showed that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate temporarily spread in soft tissues after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly spread into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted into the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion Accor@@ ding to intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the fa@@ ec@@ es .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic clear@@ ances did not exceed 200 ml / min .
in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs by these transport systems .

in the liver , Biot@@ ran@@ s@@ deformation vitamin D3 is rapidly hydro@@ xy@@ ulated to 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 in the liver and then metaboli@@ zed in the kidney to 1.@@ 25 @-@ di@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 , the bi@@ ologically active form .
ex@@ cre@@ tion In the case of the use of radio@@ actively trac@@ ed vitamin D3 in healthy volunteers , the average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine was 2.4 % in the urine after 48 hours , 4.@@ 9 % in the fa@@ ec@@ es after 4 days .
characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the percentage of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via urine .
although no clinical data is available , it is expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , a somewhat increased cum@@ ulation of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bone is expected in patients with reduced kidney function ( see section 4.2 ) .

advance is administered to adult patients with a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical trial were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplantation , with the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a treatment period of one year ( for example , by examining how often a re @-@ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , further studies on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation were conducted and examined , as Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of adverse events , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; con@@ stell@@ ations of the formulation or the ré@@ gi@@ me should only be performed under close inspection of an experienced physician ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
following a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on clinical assessment of sever@@ ance and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood mirr@@ oring ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ an@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level mirrors should be checked before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on day 4 systemic exposure , measured as a level of seb@@ um , was comparable with both terms of both ni@@ er@@ y- and transplan@@ ted patients .
meticul@@ ous and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Valley Mir@@ ror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t under Adv@@ an@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate postoperative transplan@@ t phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ an@@ f can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral consumption of medicines , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
in order to supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given .
dosage recommendations - K@@ id@@ ney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustment can be necessary later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change during the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ance Therap@@ y should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ an@@ f must be converted from twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f Cap@@ sul@@ es to a once daily intake of Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f , so this change in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose , must be performed .
after a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant to Adv@@ an@@ f once a day , the treatment with the oral initi@@ als recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ ts must begin with the transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients , who are switched to Adv@@ an@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once daily in the morning .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with advoc@@ ates in lung , pancre@@ atic and bow@@ el transplan@@ ts , occurred in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day for pancre@@ atic transplan@@ ts in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initi@@ al@@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood trans@@ missions in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the kidney function ex@@ erts no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including regular determination of serum cre@@ atine levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ an@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations for the blood level in thorou@@ gh@@ bred The dose should primarily be based on clinical assessment of sever@@ ance and toler@@ ability in individual cases by means of whole blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level controls .
it is recommended to carry frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Valley Mir@@ ror during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ seb@@ um levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after conversion from pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ an@@ f , dosage adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or at the same time using substances which could change the whole blood sugar concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the level of seb@@ um in the blood does not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the spinal level of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in full blood in the first time after liver transplantation is usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t receivers , blood concentrations were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; con@@ stell@@ ations of the formulation or the ré@@ gi@@ me should only be performed under close inspection of an experienced physician ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f is available for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t receivers and transplan@@ t receivers in childhood .
due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , taking herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other herbal remedies during treatment with Adv@@ an@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e designated as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was to be observed , which can therefore occur under Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ig@@ ner skin l@@ esi@@ ons by suitable clothing or use of a sun protection device with a high protection factor .

the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and therefore increase or decrease the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while simultaneously offering substances that can change the metabolism of the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .

pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other drugs tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can imp@@ air their metabolism .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the hormone exposure , it is necessary to carefully proceed cau@@ ti@@ ously in decisions concerning contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ time .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t studies have no indication that , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .

due to its high molecular weight , low water solu@@ bility and high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ able .
mechanism of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects At the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are likely to be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ oli@@ tic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular interior .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent suspension of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell , preventing tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes genes .

175 lung transplan@@ ts patients , in 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic transplantation , were treated as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant in 6@@ 30 cases after a colon@@ el transplan@@ t .
overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with observations in the large studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts .
lung transplantation An interim analysis of a recent multic@@ enter study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f has been reported in more than 110 patients who received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic corneal gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans syndrome , was observed less frequently in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
survival after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it came to 21.@@ 7 % of cases for the formation of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in lung transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ aci@@ - syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
a multic@@ enter trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was conducted to 205 patients who simultaneously received a pancre@@ as and kidney transplantation based on a random@@ ised procedure tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ als dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the desired level of seb@@ um from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
transplantation The published clinical results of a mon@@ oc@@ entri@@ c trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant following col@@ on transplan@@ ts showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for higher clear@@ ances observed after transplantation .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , with ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly via the bile .
in stable patients , who were converted from pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) to Adv@@ an@@ f ( once daily ) in proportion 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) related to the total daily dose , systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .

advoc@@ ates are used to treat and prevent ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder due to the lack of Factor VI@@ II .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether advoc@@ ates are used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in the joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , enabling them to form the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union named Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced differently so that the drug does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study of 53 children under 6 years , the use of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; was evaluated .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG approval for the transport of lawyers across the European Union .
dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the Factor VI@@ II @-@ deficiency , the place and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the case of subsequent hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the Factor VI@@ II @-@ activity will not fall below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients less than 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
inj@@ ections repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is over .
during the course of treatment , an appropriate determination of the Factor VI@@ II plasma level is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients can differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , achieve various in vivo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the Factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the transfer speed should be based on the patient &apos;s condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against Factor VI@@ II is a well known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml of plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to Factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 ex@@ positions is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product to another , the re @-@ occurrence of ( low @-@ tide ) inhibit@@ ors was observed in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there is no experience of using factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s , which occur in the largest number of patients , were inhibit@@ ors to Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) showing a higher risk of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the Factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosis of severe to moderate H@@ äm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to Factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 ex@@ positions .
in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of 6 years and diagnosed with severe to moderate H@@ äm@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to Factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) found a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or .
in the previously untreated patients , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE were inhibit@@ ors to factor VI@@ II .
the immune response of the patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of the antibody @-@ level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , but otherwise no signs or symptoms appeared which were referred to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , p@@ ell@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hili@@ c gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions were reported in the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products A@@ DV@@ ATE reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency unknown ) .
the activated Factor VI@@ II acts as a c@@ of@@ actor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X by factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( basic value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters stem from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients equal or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

each single pack consists of a water bottle with powder , a water bottle with 5 ml solvents ( both glass type I with chlor@@ ob@@ ut@@ yl rubber stop@@ pers ) and a device for re@@ constitution ( BA@@ X@@ J@@ ECT II ) .

based on the data available since initial approval , CH@@ MP continued to evaluate the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP based on the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , has decided that the authorisation holder is to apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited officially informed the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company will withdraw its application for the marketing of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissue that connects , surrounds and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified to produce no copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in should have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , allowing cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein found out of the p@@ 53 gene in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered .
in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study involving a patient with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer in the sub@@ structure , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP checked the company &apos;s answers to the questions asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the examination of the submitted documents , the CH@@ MP generates a list of questions sent to the company day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in injection in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors benefits patients .
the committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
moreover , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ passionate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modified active substance release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so compound that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al passages caused by allergy to poll@@ en ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ate as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are clari@@ fied .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be trac@@ ed to the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main functional measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , patients who received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients who received pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine on their own .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % versus 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who received distill@@ ation alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , mouth @-@ dried , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or one of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug for the treatment of allergies ) .
it must also not be used in patients who suffer from narrow angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular disease including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ phy ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze to the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as long @-@ term use can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after reduction of the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper air@@ ways , treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
because Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ g@@ amin , meth@@ yl pro@@ pane , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient &apos;s collective and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dys@@ functions and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients need to be informed that treatment with hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or ampli@@ fication of headache ) must be stopped .
patients with heart rhythm disorders • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be carried out at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions .
in the course of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with plac@@ ebo and plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether or not they were taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of distill@@ ate adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies showed no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness which may result in an impair@@ ment of road damage or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible tablets .
headache , anxiety , complicated mi@@ mi@@ tion , muscle weakness , increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ illary rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ Selec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily compared to plac@@ ebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under one mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in patient sub@@ groups according to gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , it is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the fluid balance of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four volunteers underwent des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n poorly .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was an exposure to the gift of an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ rop@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated applications , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine do not identify any particular dangers for humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the substance pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits at a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg / ml of ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for intake ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup and sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies to patients who also had asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by determining the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ran@@ g@@ gan@@ ing , sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body evalu@@ ates the sy@@ rup , the solution to the insertion and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the symptom ( number of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to 12 to 26 % decrease in the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in the two trials of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the reduction of the total score after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared with 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us across the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with or without a meal , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous disease progression and can be terminated upon returning the symptoms and can be resum@@ ed at their return .
the persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions haven &apos;t been found in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study did not increase the performance of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) while taking ac@@ eri@@ us and alcohol .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness which may result in an impair@@ ment of road damage or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events reported more often than plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , dry mouth dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse event was head@@ aches ; this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with disaster and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophi@@ le as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ Selec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in the course of a clinical study involving multiple doses , administered intraven@@ ously over 14 days in a dose of up to 20 mg , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no prolon@@ gation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks .
as shown on the overall results of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was sub@@ stituted for other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , despite the eti@@ ology of the different forms , is similar and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited easily pro@@ spec@@ tively .
because hist@@ amine is an caus@@ ative factor in all of the ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that , apart from the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is expected to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies of 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pre@@ mat@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ ri@@ later@@ als at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the majority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
improvement of the itch by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were compared with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily application of distill@@ ate adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the distill@@ ate adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs are not completely excluded .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies show that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n at a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies performed with the L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of L@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ rop@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine do not identify any particular dangers for humans .

ap@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there is no data to support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
apart from the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
around 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are metaboli@@ se des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher exposure to substances ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that in children who are normally metaboli@@ zed .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ ch@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions haven &apos;t been found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol was not increased by the effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged 2 to 11 was similar to the plac@@ ebo group in the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose of 3 % reported more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents diagnosed up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily dose of alcohol of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in the course of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the distill@@ ate adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in adults and adolescents , in the distill@@ ate adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was used over ten days in adults , no prolon@@ gation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval indicated .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and teenagers , there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .
at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents showed no impair@@ ment of psych@@ om@@ otor functions in clinical studies .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol used neither to increase the alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment nor to increase drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the overall results of the questionnaire on quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies of 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pre@@ mat@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ ri@@ later@@ als at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup formation on children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that are fully metaboli@@ sed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) caused by des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was approximately 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications for a clin@@ ically relevant active substance cum@@ ulation after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , the AU@@ C and C@@ max levels of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable in the recommended doses with those of adults who received the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the distill@@ ate adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup is offered in type III bra@@ id bottles with a child @-@ safe polypropylene closing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

immediately before use , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate can be removed without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions haven &apos;t been found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dose ) were applied , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
in the course of a clinical study involving multiple doses in which a dose of up to 20 mg had been used daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no prolon@@ gation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in controlled clinical studies , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement parameters of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the overall results of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

immediately before use , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tablet is removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven yet .
the overall frequency of side effects between the L@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and plac@@ ebo group was equal and did not differ significantly from the safety profile set out in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s melting tablet proved to be the bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat for the wor@@ sen@@ - formulation of distill@@ ate adi@@ n .

in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement variables of flight performance , including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this poorly metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar for adults ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients , however , was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ sat the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients , in conjunction with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us processed tablets the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that in children who are normally metaboli@@ zed .
this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ ch@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged 2 to 11 was similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
in infants between 6 and 23 months , the most frequent side effects reported more often than plac@@ ebo reported diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , no side effects in patients between 6 and 11 years of age were observed at a single @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and teenagers , there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also occur in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of the symptoms .
as shown on the overall results of the questionnaire on quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

if your allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is inter@@ mitt@@ ent ( the symptoms will occur less than 4 days a week or last less than 4 weeks ) , your doctor will recommend you a treatment scheme that depends on your previous illness .
if your allergic rh@@ initi@@ s pers@@ ist ( the symptoms may occur on 4 or more days per week and last for more than 4 weeks ) , your doctor may recommend you a lasting treatment .
if you forgot to take A@@ eri@@ us if you forgot to take your dose in time , take it as soon as possible and then follow the normal treatment plan again .
71 After the introduction of A@@ eri@@ us , very rare cases of severe allergic reactions ( difficulty breathing , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , n@@ ett@@ le rash and swelling ) and rash are reported .

in June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. issued official approval to the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company withdraw@@ s its application for the marketing of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov on the prevention of the avi@@ ar H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
influ@@ enza pan@@ de@@ mic outbreak occurs when a new strain of the flu virus arises , which can easily be spread from human to human because humans have not yet built immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
this means that the immune system is later able to form antibodies in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane covering of the virus was separated with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as foreign ) , puri@@ fied and used as part of the vaccine .
a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
therefore , the scope of the clinical data base for ass@@ essing the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are interested in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you would like more information on the CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for use , but it cannot be taken together with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked which an@@ tivi@@ ral medication the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood is that the virus is addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines are taken .
for children between 4 and 12 years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase depends on body weight .
in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV amount in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
aids can not cure AIDS , but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases related to AIDS .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two primary studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
this medicine , enhanced with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used to take prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in virus load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml of less than plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , with only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , responded only very few to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the medicine A@@ gener@@ ase used Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load as effectively as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors after 16 weeks of treatment :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for a stronger drop in the viral load after four weeks as in the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used in patients , St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or drugs that are broken down in the same way as a@@ gen@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( bone tissue death ) or immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors prevail over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic enh@@ ancer Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee noted that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally authorised under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued approval for the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the transport of A@@ gener@@ ase across the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
generally speaking , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should be done taking into account the individual viral load pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for use on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the enhancing addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sted ) , higher doses of as@@ best@@ os ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ ure@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under the age of 4 , due to the lack of data on the harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be treated with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent the substrates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
vegetable preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
in general , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences .
in case of simultaneous an@@ tivi@@ ral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metaboli@@ sed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Cus@@ hing and supp@@ res@@ sor of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some drugs that cause serious or life threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ ine , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration of active substances .
in patients taking these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for eye removal symptoms , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl alcohol content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an exac@@ er@@ bation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases in which drugs were needed to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B . a higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there are reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ thro@@ sis .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune deficiency , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections that lead to serious clinical condition or deterioration of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology ( including cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long@@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates with low therapeutic width should not be given at the same time with medicines which have low therapeutic width and also represent the substrates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with medicines , whose active ingredients are mainly metaboli@@ sed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in trying to compensate the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , undesi@@ rable effects on the liver were often observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ cular mirror and , if possible , check the virus load and replace the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
increased by 30 % for C@@ max , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily that att@@ est to the efficacy and safety of this treatment schema .
52 % lower when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been achieved twice a day in the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are about 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but a close monitoring is recommended because the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ dis component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dosage adjustment is not necessary .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in possibly reduces the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
should these medicines be used at the same time , be careful as del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be carried out , as an exact predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in doses of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will go to at least half the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data for this .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ says in combination with er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin have not been carried out , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the event of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole per day led to an increase in the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2,@@ 69@@ times in comparison to the value observed once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other drugs that are listed below may possibly cause interactions , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors , or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if used together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines , when applied in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that ant@@ acids should not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase as it may result in res@@ or@@ ption errors .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ ne@@ di@@ pine , di@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine ,
con@@ current consumption with A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase its plasma concentrations and ampli@@ fy the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days , the fluor@@ es@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval from 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ tical cor@@ tical effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
for H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected with simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this drug is not recommended with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
frequent monitoring of the therapeutic levels is recommended to stabili@@ ze the mirrors as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used together with or@@ ally bi@@ ased mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while cau@@ tious while using A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al m@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ases point to a possible increase in plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 @-@ 4 times .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for eye removal symptoms , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation on how to adjust the dose of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not pre@@ dict@@ ably so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study on pregnant rats , administered by the evap@@ oration into the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 12 body weight in po@@ sterity .
the further development of seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely lead to ab@@ rupt treatment .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine applied to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of as@@ ure@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as well as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as laboratory alterations ( grade 3 to 4 ) occur in the treatment .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and facial fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ c fat accumulation ( stit@@ ching ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( sti@@ cking ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , 2@@ 45 patients treated patients with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients with in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin ras@@ hes usually were slightly pronounced , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or macro@@ cos@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be stopped .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis was reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable to those who received as@@ ure@@ ase along with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often occurred .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures .

the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells .
the relationship between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described rarely were observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral dil@@ uted patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to fossi@@ ls with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced lik@@ el@@ ihood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in combination with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four genetic patterns associated with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r creates a certain crus@@ ade resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r stays in general .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 fossi@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had failed ( one of them demonstrated a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ qu@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early abor@@ tion of a promising therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a multitude of mut@@ ations within limits , which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre@@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; oo@@ st@@ ert . &quot;
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity towards A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group with regard to time @-@ ad@@ mis@@ ed average change from bas@@ eline ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ under@@ lay threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of efficacy of un@@ leavened A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ a &apos;s solution to intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg was examined three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low @-@ dose k@@ night avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks about 25 % of patients en@@ rolled in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to bas@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r amounts approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
increased by 30 % for C@@ max , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal results in a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained unaffected by food intake , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the scale and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 litres ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be placed on a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imped@@ ed penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bund@@ led am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that represents the active portion , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , or a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , must be administered with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , results in a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure such as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram base .
the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al function disorder should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels similar to those who are achieved twice a day after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occurred in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.8 times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application , there were little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , which included bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical studies , neither during administration nor after treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality both in the control animals and in the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dose in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus el@@ on@@ gation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which point to delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the enhancing addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sted ) , higher doses of as@@ best@@ os ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with moderate or slight liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some drugs that cause serious or life threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ ine , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration of active substances .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed in a period of 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk for li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
increased by 30 % for C@@ max , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been achieved twice a day in the combination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are about 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but a close monitoring is recommended because the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be carried out , as an exact predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in doses of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will fall to at least half the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data for this .

in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days , the fluor@@ es@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval from 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decline in the AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % , respectively .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study on pregnant rats , administered by the evap@@ oration into the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight in po@@ sterity .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures .
the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the benefits of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , medicines that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , or a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , must be administered with caution when given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .

studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality both in the control animals and in the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in young animals the metabolism ways are not yet fully mature , allowing am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z .
A@@ gener@@ ase solution for use is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .

the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for use on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as there is no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take and low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination is avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col@@ ate content , A@@ gener@@ ase is a solution to take in infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure contra@@ indicated .
the simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive hem@@ ming of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some drugs that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ ine , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the concentration of active substances .

increased by 30 % for C@@ max , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
con@@ current consumption with A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase its plasma concentrations and result in associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is expected to significantly increase plasma concentrations after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for the human being is not known . as a result of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us on the contained prop@@ yl @-@ gly@@ col it is not allowed to apply during pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .

a reproduction study on pregnant rats , administered by the dis@@ armament in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase in 55 body weight during the down@@ time .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine applied to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described rarely were observed .
early abor@@ tion of a degenerative 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a multitude of mut@@ ations within limits , which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 litres ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be placed on a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imped@@ ed penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dose in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus el@@ on@@ gation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which point to delayed development .

the frequency of application and the duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • For small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied five times a week for six weeks .
before bed@@ time , apply the cream thin@@ ly to the affected areas of the skin , so that it remains on the skin sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) before it is washed away .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four major studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two trials in which patients were treated six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the plac@@ ebo executed either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ oses .
• In all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • The total cure rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with plac@@ ebo . • The results of the two trials on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a total cure rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of l@@ esi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or acceptance of a cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
apply on Mon@@ days , Wedn@@ es@@ days and Fri@@ days or Tu@@ es@@ days , Thurs@@ days and Satur@@ days before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream is ongoing until all visible tendencies have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal region , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an interruption in the treatment course described above should be considered when intensive local inflamm@@ ations occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if a follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only completely healed , another therapy should be initiated ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose has been om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream once he / she notices this and then continue with the usual therapy plan .
apply the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and then rub in the skin area infected with the cow@@ l until the cream is completely absorbed .
there should be a balance in these patients between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a balance in these patients between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
in other studies where no daily pre @-@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe mo@@ mo@@ sis and a case with circumcision of leading stro@@ kes were observed .
in rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation has been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or has led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the outlet of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream directly after treatment with other sub@@ cut@@ aneous treatments for the treatment of external f@@ eig@@ ni@@ es in the genital and peri@@ anal areas , no clinical experience has yet been available .
although limited data indicate an increased rate of inclin@@ ation reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this group of patients regarding the removal of tendencies .
treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair@@ line was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment period of several days may be made .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there are currently no data on long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
there are no clinical experience in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tumours .
data from an open clinical study suggest that large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) are less likely to respond to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has not been studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or lip area within the lips .
very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses on anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p are available .
the available data on the act@@ ini@@ c ker@@ at@@ ose on the under@@ arms and hands does not support the efficacy in this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity in the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days .
data from an open clinical trial showed that patients with more than 8 patients showed a lower total healing rate than patients with fewer than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to the immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) can be quanti@@ fied neither after one @-@ time nor after multi @-@ time topical application , there is no recommendation to apply during breast@@ feeding .
the most commonly shared and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream related adverse events in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the place of treatment of the inc@@ ision ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the most commonly reported and possibly or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the cases reported by 185 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine @-@ Cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of the Phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common , possibly or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream in the associated side effect , were in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
the evaluation of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently lead to local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ation / fl@@ aps / fl@@ aps ( 23 % ) and e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
according to the test plan , the clinical signs presented according to the test plan show that with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe scar@@ ring and sal@@ v@@ age ( 19 % ) occurred .
in clinical studies investigating the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ an ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the inad@@ vert@@ ent or@@ ale absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could cause nausea , vom@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was in hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous dos@@ ages .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy in relation to a complete healing of tendencies in i@@ od@@ ine @-@ i@@ od@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo @-@ treatment is clearly superior .
at 60 % of the patients who were treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine , the patients healed completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine , compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of i@@ od@@ ine od@@ ine for five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data obtained from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that around 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and stayed for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od over three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic acne l@@ esi@@ ons within a related 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the hair@@ y scal@@ p or face .
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rent rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications Ou@@ ter F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen , ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma normally do not appear in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Creme was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies of children between 2 and 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more )
a minimal systemic up@@ take of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three @-@ week application for 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 p@@ ou@@ ch ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the estimated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 hours half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin .
systemic exposure data showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study carried out for four months for der@@ mal application yiel@@ ded no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not in@@ duce tum@@ ors at the application .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption of the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , there is a risk for the human being to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the substance @-@ free cream , previously and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .
it may harm other people , even if they have the same symptoms as you do . − If any of the adverse side effects do you significantly affect or you notice side effects not indicated in this usage information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .

this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not broken down and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , which complic@@ ate movements , reduce lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should be performed in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alization equipment , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study mainly investig@@ ates the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining the effect related to reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the liver &apos;s size ) .
in children under five years of age , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms lowered G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by around 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , skin rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , feeling of heat , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion office .
very common side effects in patients less than five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement magnitude of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known each year , and update this summary , where necessary .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is a manufacturer of patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms with regard to the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O m@@ am@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Ei@@ erst@@ ock of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where recovery facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
as a result of the clinical phase III study , it is expected that nearly all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience in the recovery of treatment after a longer break , it is necessary to cau@@ ti@@ ously proceed cau@@ ti@@ ously due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment .
60 minutes before commen@@ cement of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion has to be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
the in@@ fusion can be re@@ recorded with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous response has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ency with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not prec@@ lu@@ de direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase about breast milk are present , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me during treatment .
adverse events in clinical studies were predominantly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in the context of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are shown in the following table according to the following abund@@ ances : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing stand@@ still and facial e@@ dem@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted Drug Effects in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe trial form and duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , a Ser@@ o@@ con@@ ian version occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , with a severe sequ@@ ential form usually within one month to a Ser@@ o@@ con@@ ian version ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 trial ( or up to a premature withdrawal from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients showed no antibodies ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients who had never come to Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ y .
patients with low to low antibody levels reported a robust reduction in the G@@ AG level in the urine , while a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was observed in patients with high antibody ti@@ tr@@ es .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro , which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of undesi@@ rable drug reactions , even though the occurrence of undesi@@ rable drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason@@ ing of the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub @-@ str@@ ata and the prevention of a further accumulation of sufficient re@@ plen@@ ishment of the enzyme activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ nose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were examined in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the whole range of illnesses , the majority of patients were of the middle @-@ phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( Fe@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for effectiveness were the percentage change in the expected Fe@@ V and the total distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms every week for 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and capacity , which is shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as highlighted in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of Fe@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the size of growing children .
of 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ at@@ oma prior to treatment 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear decrease of the G@@ AG Mir@@ ror was observed in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous manifestation of the disease between the patients , which was taken into consideration by using a combined end point , the clin@@ ically significant change of five efficacy variables ( reduced in 6 @-@ minute hearing test , range of motion of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , was generally observed in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age at the time of their inclusion ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were observed after the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe course of course ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe course of course only limited or no progress in cognitive development were to be observed .
in a phase 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing regi@@ mens were performed at the G@@ AG Mir@@ ror in the urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of patients under the age of 5 was similar to that in older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ rop@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ time administration , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular dangers for humans .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines , except with the ones listed below .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it cannot be stored for longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C if the di@@ lution was under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .

within the given time , the owner of the marketing licence has concluded the following programme of studies , whose results form the basis for the annual evaluation report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information for patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , is either present in a small amount or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have encountered a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines please inform your doctor if you use medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ ain because there is a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
indications for the handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to the application and is intended for the intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical specialists ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased by a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ IV @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing stand@@ still and facial e@@ dem@@ a .
very common ( occurrence with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • joint pain , joint pain , back pain , pain in the arms and legs • increased pulse • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • response at the in@@ fusion office
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the packages template will be updated .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it cannot be stored for longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C if the di@@ lution was under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • first determine the number of di@@ lu@@ ent flow bottles according to the body weight of each patient .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medicines for cancer ) and &quot; malign@@ ant &quot; ( cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy in patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received chemotherapy .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ cancer &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( in order to prevent fluid deficiency ) should be given before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood pressure changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , stopped or the dose is reduced .
the active form of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed thus slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed into its active form is more readily available in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and a longer active life in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural oth@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survive an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time was 8.3 months compared with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el at 7.@@ 9 months .
in both studies , however , patients in which cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta , had longer survival rates than with the comparative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each punch bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a resolution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see paragraph 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - ally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is given intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours after the end of the tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is given intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid should be given the day before and on the day of the tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed dose and the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the intake should be continued throughout the duration of the therapy as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) per week before the first p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed dose and after every third operation cycle .
in patients receiving tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood @-@ image should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and plat@@ el@@ et count .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose check must take place taking into consideration the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood @-@ image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the predicted therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated in accordance with the indications in T@@ ables 1 , 2 and 3 which are to be applied for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC level 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ Grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA has to be stopped if a ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose @-@ reduc@@ ti@@ o- ten@@ dons or so@@ - at the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies did not indicate that patients at the age of 65 yr@@ s or over the age of 65 have an increased risk of adverse effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
in clinical trials there were no dosage adjustment in patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dosage adjustment recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of less than 45 ml / min was insufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients have to be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ ression and p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed should not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils again reach a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the plat@@ el@@ et number returns a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , plat@@ el@@ et number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in degrees of 3 / 4 ha@@ emat@@ ological and non @-@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia were considered o @-@ ob@@ tru@@ sive when a pre@@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore all patients treated with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must be instructed to use foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous ing@@ es@@ tion of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients for which a tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed therapy is fores@@ een must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , a drainage of the eff@@ usion in front of the tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed treatment should be considered in patients with a clin@@ ically significant accumulation of fluid in the trans@@ cellular space .
5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials using tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , when this ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible reduction of reproductive capacity by p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised to seek advice regarding the sperm conservation .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can lead to reduced tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion resulting in increased occurrence of side effects .
therefore caution is recommended if high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses should be applied in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days prior to therapy , to be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided using tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with tel@@ emet@@ ric .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy demands an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy .
tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed may not be applied during pregnancy except when essential and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk of fo@@ etus ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible deterioration of reproductive capacity is due to p@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the block preservation .

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that ex@@ erts its effect by stopping short @-@ term , acid @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed works as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with multiple targets by inhibit@@ ing the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent enzymes of de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and pur@@ in- u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , easy @-@ blind stage 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma showed that with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , patients had clin@@ ically meaningful advantage of survival compared to those patients who were only cau@@ c@@ ately cau@@ tioned with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medication ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural ar@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) in relation to the single C@@ is@@ pl@@ ot@@ tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms resulted in an improvement in lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy was medi@@ an survival of 8.3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival resulted in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( n = 172 , 6.2 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separately random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in combination with gem@@ cit@@ abine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
mean PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .

CI = Evi@@ dence interval ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ sub@@ le@@ gen@@ tial limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and plat@@ el@@ et trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
furthermore , the patients required sel@@ f@@ - ten@@ er the administration of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n / dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ eti@@ n ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3,@@ 1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron supplements ( 4,@@ 3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² were examined in in@@ fu@@ sions over a period of 10 minutes .
tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found unchanged within 24 hours of use in the urine .
tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le dogs , who had received intraven@@ ous bol@@ us inj@@ ections for 9 months , corneal changes were observed ( degeneration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ ster epitheli@@ al tissue ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the colouring varies from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow , without compromising the quality of the products .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
patients who take All@@ i and do not have weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot break down some fats in the food , resulting in about a quarter of the fats fed with the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed by the intest@@ ines .
in a third study All@@ i was compared to plac@@ ebo in 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
in the two studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after a year versus 2,3 kg in taking plac@@ ebo .
the study of all@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for the patients with relevant weight loss .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches on after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with step lab@@ yrinth , bow@@ string , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , leaving o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with drugs such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or in cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the transport of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K across the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( body mass index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ical , fat @-@ reduced diet .
all@@ i should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there are not enough data on efficacy and safety .
however , as or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ bed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or any of the other components • Premature treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Diag@@ nosis • Pre@@ gn@@ ancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
since weight loss in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist prior to treatment with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti @-@ di@@ ab@@ etic must be adjusted if necessary .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or high cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs has to be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures in order to prevent the oral contrac@@ eption possible in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma level was observed .
when using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the quick @-@ values ( international normal@@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see paragraph 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients who have been treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K remain in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take a mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin up@@ take ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of an A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one one @-@ time dose , a marginal decrease in A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug because the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
the frequency of adverse events reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to inhi@@ bitions with regard to possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days at normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid recovery of possible systemic effects deri@@ ving from the li@@ pas@@ inhibit@@ ory properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect is based on the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by means of co@@ valent bonding to active ser@@ ine residue of ga@@ stri@@ c and pancre@@ atic li@@ ds .
clinical studies have shown that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies of adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ critical , fat @-@ reduced diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ cholest@@ erin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( bas@@ eline : 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist circum@@ ference the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60@@ mg ( initial value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be detected spor@@ adic@@ ally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
two major met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , i.e. M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after de@@ activation of the N @-@ form @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified in a study with obes@@ e patients , representing approximately 42 % of total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ rop@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , can@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data can not identify any particular threat to humans .

the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the beginning of the treatment , as at this time you may not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutritional supplements : • Beg@@ in you already have a few days , or better a week before taking capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit by mistake . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to take per meal , not to take it in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial dessert , as you may have done with other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in which these accompanying symptoms occur learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet .
• Do not store drugs for children . • Do not store any more than 25 ° C. • Ke@@ ep container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .

Alo@@ is is used for chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ is can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti @-@ cancer drug ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , which prevents the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
in three major studies , Alo@@ is studied at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate releases for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in the case of chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ ha showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 from 2@@ 21 ) .
in the case of chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate releases for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ ha showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 by 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ ha ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . , a permit for the marketing of Alo@@ ha in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ is is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ is for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
because pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ pation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be monitored closely after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is recommended with simultaneous offering of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to be such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ is should not be used to prevent or treat nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents studied against tum@@ ors ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation of oral Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ i@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , bit@@ ur@@ dol , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience of the application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies is not present , therefore pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams were reported ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , possibly associated with al@@ al@@ ma@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the destination ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ action relationships to be observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed , however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy with an Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 of dol@@ om@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7,@@ 3 hours ) that was given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine , and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of studies with moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and d@@ ag@@ et@@ ron .
after clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of the given pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3 90 μ / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients .
intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was measured in 11 tes@@ tic@@ ular carcin@@ oma patients between day 1 and day 5 ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that at once daily intraven@@ ous injection of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on 3 consecutive days , the total text ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable to the value measured after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the entry of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor in comparison to Pal@@ onite .
in @-@ vitro studies for metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination Accor@@ ding to an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous injection injection in healthy patients , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal Eli@@ mination time and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but this does not justify a reduction of the dose .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were only observed after ex@@ positions that are considered adequate for the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing low relevance for clinical use .
10 From prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , indications have shown that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of action .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dosage correspon@@ ded in about 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , en@@ doc@@ rine Ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary gland , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ is is determined by humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the holder of this authorisation for the transport market must inform the European Commission about the plans for placing the drug approved within the framework of this decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution for the marketing of the drug provided for the treatment of hepatitis C .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug @-@ like ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal product &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in the case of a micro@@ scopic investigation , the liver tissue damages damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood ab@@ normally increase .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates the formation of the active substance .
Al@@ ph@@ eon &apos;s manufacturer submitted data suggest@@ ing the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference medicinal product to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment ( i.e. no evidence of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
moreover , concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed would not suff@@ ice .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , which responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ ema and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ ema , the disease fl@@ amed back to more patients than with the reference medicinal product ; Al@@ ph@@ eon also had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug respon@@ ds to an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) is not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection accompanied by cru@@ st@@ ac@@ eans ) and small infected la@@ ths ( crack or inc@@ isions ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ w@@ ed wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ ic Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not have an effect against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the skin surface to be treated must not be more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cured at the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients with Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo arm the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin patients , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together in skin rounds , about 90 % of patients in both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it has been found that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( stained @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that have been proven or presumably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the surface of the order .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the following super@@ ficial skin infections in short @-@ term treatment : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small la@@ ths , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
may 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . approval for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of sensi@@ tization or serious local irrit@@ ation by the use of retin@@ ol o@@ int@@ ment the treatment should be stopped , the o@@ int@@ ment must be carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection should begin .
retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as a patho@@ gen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) in clinical studies was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
because of the low plasma concentrations attained in humans after topical application on sk@@ ewed skin or infected surface wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After oral administration of 2 times a day 200 m@@ g. of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the average retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to topical application of 1 % retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on a weakened skin of healthy adult males by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dosage adjustment is not considered necessary if topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are insufficient in relation to a statement on the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to a systemic antibiotic .
the decision whether breast@@ feeding should be continued / stopped or continued / terminated with Al@@ tar@@ go is to weigh the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , which have applied al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side effect was irrit@@ ation at the site , approximately 1 % of the patients concerned .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance which is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the effect mechanism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site is involved in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 and is located in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bit the transfer of pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if the use of retina in at least some infection forms appears question@@ able due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , advice should be sought by experts .
no differences were observed in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the event of a non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption in a healthy adult study , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and sc@@ ented skin for up to 7 days .
in 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic exposure to the human after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid gland alterations .
in @-@ vitro examination on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma @-@ test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in the rat micro@@ kernel test for in vivo investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 ) abra@@ ded skin :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats were observed at oral dosing of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold of estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
therefore , Ambi@@ rix should only be used if there is low risk of hepatitis B infection while imm@@ uni@@ zation , and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan existing from two doses can be completed .
if a refres@@ her dose is requested against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defense ) , as it can fight against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contains the same components as the in@@ oc@@ ulation of the Twin@@ rix adult approved since 1996 and the Twin@@ rix children approved since 1997 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix groups contain identical components , some of the data supporting the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the final injection .
in an additional study involving 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix progres@@ sed between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar to six months and a 12 month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection site , redness , fatigue ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als s.@@ a. a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standardi@@ z@@ ination plan for the imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two doses , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster shots are desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines or combination vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
the anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ H@@ V antibodies are in the same order as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have responded to a Hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination need a booster shots as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in cases of no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , adequate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , it is recommended to use a combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units with form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody @-@ level can be achieved after primary dimm@@ ing , so that in these cases the gift of additional vacc@@ ines may be required .
since intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal success in the glut@@ eal muscle , these injection ways should be avoided .
in th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously , as it may result in ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages after intra@@ muscular administration .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ el , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , the immune response was adequate to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it has to be assumed that no adequate immune response may be achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever were similar to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ age and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine form@@ ulations .
in clinical trials 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered on a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a basis of calculation per vaccine , but not on a basis of calculation per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of subjects , compared with 3@@ 9,@@ 1 % in subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the test persons who had given Ambi@@ rix reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the test persons who were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who got Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of severe pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , which was observed when using the 3 @-@ cann@@ ed combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , however , there was a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band .
the share of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted for vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , serum conver@@ sions for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose administered in the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study carried out in 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were obtained with three doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was ex@@ changeable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the 3 dosage vaccine was administered significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune responses , which were achieved within a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines either received a 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of mal@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ months vaccine .
the immun@@ ore@@ action observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that which after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was detected in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial involving 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies was comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine scheme compared to the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccine scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the booster shots of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ el , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , the immune response was adequate to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and serum conver@@ gence rates as for the previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ en@@ sion on any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
according to Article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the State Char@@ ge Sharing is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for that purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as swimming in waters contaminated by water .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may necess@@ itate a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series with 2 doses has been completed .
if you are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ines , ( although your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections affecting the liver or causing symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be caused by it@@ chy skin ras@@ hes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • if your child has already suffered an allergic reaction to a previous vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child has severe infection with fever / fever .
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usual administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he / her child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second in@@ oc@@ ulation dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected with people suffering from severe bleeding disturbances , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weak due to illness or treatment in your / his body &apos;s def@@ ences , or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals on vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction to the vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated recently / has been given / has given / has given / or this is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is insufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given to Ambi@@ rix at the same time , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
typically , Ambi@@ rix is not administered pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgently needed to be vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .
♦ A very common case ( more than 1 case per 10 in@@ im@@ ated doses ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort on the spot or redness • Mat@@ te@@ ousness • irrit@@ ability • headache • appetite deficiency

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on data known since the first approval for the transport market , CH@@ MP has seen that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was only put into circulation in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure .
am@@ mo@@ p can also be used in patients at the age of more than 1 month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
Am@@ mon@@ schn@@ aps - divided on several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ po@@ stom@@ y hose ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading hose ) .
there was no comparative study since Am@@ mon@@ schn@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
Am@@ mon@@ ary may also cause loss of appetite , abnormal acidity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle has effectively prevented ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ schn@@ aps was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval there was limited information about this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already been manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect that mani@@ f@@ ests after the first month of life ) there is an indication for use when a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually , taking account of the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development .
according to clinical experience , regular daily dose sodium but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight exceeding 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ d@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing as there is a risk for the formation of Es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a when the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium but@@ yl rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as clinical conditions associated with sodium retention and o@@ dem@@ a .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it slow@@ ed the ne@@ ural prolifer@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted into the breast milk in humans , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least 56 % of patients showed at least one adverse event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these unwanted events was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and sometimes ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient with metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , bul@@ let top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an inad@@ vert@@ ent single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metaboli@@ se active compound , which is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that , for each gram , mon@@ oso@@ dium glut@@ amine can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately commen@@ ced to improve survival chances and clinical results .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ested , and the disease itself led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life .
as a result of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative channels of nit@@ ric acid ( sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born babies at post@@ part@@ um ( however within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients , it came with time for many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ d@@ scar@@ can@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium poly@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is en@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by dose of a single dose of 5 g. of sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in case of so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in metabolism and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied for intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous sodium but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in cancer patients .
after an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected 15 minutes after taking .
in most cases , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the majority of patients with ur@@ ic acid deficiency ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day ) was no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium poly@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the average levels of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma level were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
after the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test results , sodium poly@@ but@@ y@@ rat was not treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( investigation 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( babies and children , who still cannot swal@@ low tablets , or patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al probe .
according to clinical experience , regular daily dose sodium but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in infants , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight exceeding 20 kg , as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ d@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient with metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , bul@@ let top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that , for each gram , mon@@ oso@@ dium glut@@ amine can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium bi@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ular form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected 15 minutes after taking .
during the duration of the shelf life , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
in this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient has to receive the medication by a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS may also be dissolved in water prior to use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot secre@@ te the nit@@ ro@@ genous waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after consuming proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out at your disposal , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine can pass to breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , headache , taste disturbances , negligence , des@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion , memory problems and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or hospital for the purpose of an appropriate treatment .
if you miss taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( ACS , reduced blood flow to the heart ) , for example in inst@@ able ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients with a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI , patients often have a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as c@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without application of GP@@ I - in the prevention of new events ( death cases , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as the conventional treatment .
in patients undergoing PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective in relation to all indicators as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , with which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ dated ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine , or any of the other ingredients .
it may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd for the transport of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous dose of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is subsequently performed in the patient , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
immediately before the procedure , a cle@@ ation of 0.5 mg / kg should be given followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a direct following IV in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the procedure .
the safety and efficacy of any Bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt load of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be performed .
in order to reduce the incidence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before use and the bol@@ us dose should be administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value amounts to more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer necessary , provided that the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dosage should be checked again .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al damage , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , included for approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after application of the Bi@@ vali@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adaptation at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration is finished .
• a known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the ha@@ emo@@ st@@ as@@ es@@ ystems and / or ir@@ reversible ar@@ tery disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients must be monitored carefully during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ vali@@ dating is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if most of the blood counts on arter@@ ial points occur in PCI patients under Bi@@ vali@@ dated din , patients who undergo a per@@ tory cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can cause bleeding in principle throughout the treatment .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ c@@ anti@@ ru@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be taken into consideration to ensure that the value after replacing the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is again reached the level before the treatment .
based on the knowledge about the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te unit ) , it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ cy@@ c@@ ine with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological check @-@ up parameters can be monitored regularly .
the experimental investigations are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ dated alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ dating din plus GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or es@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ din Group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding like in Table 2 &apos;s foot@@ notes .
both mild and heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings occur significantly less frequently under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ id plus GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point of the point , reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding place , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other &quot; point &quot; points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat , were further , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ al@@ is@@ ations that occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) .
the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with Bi@@ vali@@ dating in 6000 patients undergoing PCI .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ dated Group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less in Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported in practice after comprehensive application and are group@@ ed according to system organ classes in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is immediately to be removed and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with a view to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ der inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center as well as in the ani@@ onic binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is present in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on his part re@@ stores the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , serum induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past did not in@@ duce th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ag@@ gregation response .
in healthy volunteers and in patients Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent an@@ tic@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect occupied by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if one PCI is performed in the following , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or prior to angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or with the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , requiring angi@@ ography in 72 hours , were evenly distributed across the 3 arms .
about 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ C changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients submitted within 72 hours of angi@@ ography .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on four triple and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are presented in table 10 .
clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din were evaluated in patients who underwent a per@@ tory cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .
as a pep@@ tide , Bi@@ vali@@ dating is expected to pass a cat@@ aboli@@ sm into its amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent re@@ utilization of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary Met@@ aboli@@ t resulting from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence through th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is not effective because of the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of thro@@ mb@@ ine .

based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ rop@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data can not identify any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ity in animals repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks at exposure to 10 @-@ cases of the clinical ste@@ ady @-@ state @-@ plasma concentration ) was limited to over@@ shooting pharmac@@ ological effects .
adverse events due to long @-@ term physiological stress in response to non @-@ home@@ ost@@ atic co@@ ag@@ ulation were not observed after short @-@ term exposure comparable to those in clinical use , even at very much higher dosage .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes who need treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) inj@@ ected into the abdominal wall , thi@@ ghs or upper arm or administered as a continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin for the regulation of glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or cannot process insulin .
insulin lu@@ c@@ sin differs very slightly from the insulin analog , and the change means that it has a quicker effect and shorter mode of action than a short @-@ acting insulin analog .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between 4 and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where body insulin cannot be effectively processed , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study conducted by adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in comparison to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin @-@ le@@ aps .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % at human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin @-@ lu@@ c@@ sin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH approval for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , th@@ igh or delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion in the abdom@@ en area .
due to the reduced glucose tolerance and the reduced insulin metabolism , the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function .
any change of the effective strength , the brand ( her@@ me@@ tic ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production may undergo a change in insulin requirements .
3 . inadequate dosing or abor@@ tion , especially in patients with insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
changing a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change of the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme .
these include oral anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic agents , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , poly@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates , and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c anti@@ gens can be weakened or missing under the effect of li@@ ke@@ oly@@ tics such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , c@@ lon@@ i@@ din , gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ c@@ sin and the human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin lu@@ c@@ sin occurs in human breast milk , but generally insulin does not enter into breast milk , nor is it absorbed after oral use .
listed below are the adverse drug k@@ ings known from clinical trials , group@@ ed by system organ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
cold welding , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , di@@ zz@@ iness , excessive dog , head@@ aches , nausea , and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy will be fo@@ amed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , resulting in li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site .
serious hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a correspon@@ dingly trained person or administered by a physician by intraven@@ ous injection of glucose .
after glu@@ ing , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose up@@ take ( in particular skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that the effect occurs faster with a sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin lu@@ c@@ sin and the amount of action is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , insulin lu@@ c@@ ine showed a proportional amount of glucose in the therapeutic relevant dosing range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in glu@@ cos@@ es@@ en@@ ic effect , just like human insulin .
insulin lu@@ c@@ ine has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves a complete glu@@ cos@@ es@@ en@@ ic action about 2 hours earlier than acting insulin .
from the data it was obvious that a similar post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved in an application of insulin ly@@ s@@ ine 2 minutes before meal , as with a human@@ ly regular insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin lu@@ c@@ sin was dos@@ ed 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale control than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal , was achieved .
if insulin ly@@ s@@ ine is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a similar gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control as with a human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - nu@@ des before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) , is achieved .
insulin lu@@ c@@ sin 2 minutes before beginning of the meal compared to the normal insulin analog which was given 30 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and in comparison to a normal insulin analog which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin lu@@ c@@ sin for 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to a human@@ oid standard insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
