<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or treatment, please read the packages (also included in the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information on the CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. chaotic thinking and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental illness in which patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes and for the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased restlessness or behavioural problems when oral consumption of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be applied or the melting tablets are used in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who use other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the transmission of signals between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances which enable communication between neurons and neurotransmitters.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is believed to be a "partial agony" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent, acts as the neurotransmitter to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its reoccurring.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent the recurrence of symptoms was examined in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared with a placebo in two studies of 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders, suffering from increased unrest, over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify Injection Solution was compared in a study on 301 patients with bipolar disorder, suffering from increased unrest, with the treatment of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was examined based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution for taking into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms compared to patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term clinical symptoms more effectively than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Furthermore, up to 74 weeks of placebo, Abilify was able to prevent recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common Abilify effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrollable sugars), dizziness (drowsiness), drowsiness (drowsiness), drowsiness (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (insomnia) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of abilify in treating schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients with predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes insisted on the treatment with Aripiprazl, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural problems in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approving the transport of Abilify across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar-I- disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who predominantly had manic episodes and their manic episodes responded to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for bilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased efficacy in doses above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar-I- disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">A lower initial dose should be taken into account with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazl dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no increased risk of suicide using Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are predisposed for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including akceleried and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia appearing during the treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients treated with Abilify experience signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesia should be considered to reduce the dose or to break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazl should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at conditions associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazl in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no accurate risk assessments for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyphaggia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia and in patients with bipolar deficiency because of comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is recommended when Aripiprazl is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blockers, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, although this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study involving healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC from Aripiprazl by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'poor' ('poor') metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6 of extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common application of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should be outweighed for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be lifted to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify are administered, can be expected with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextrometamorphic / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (dextrometamoran).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used in pregnancy due to the lack of data for safety in humans and due to the concerns in reproductive studies of the animal, unless the potential benefits clearly justify the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, like other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative impact on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side-effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole underwent a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared with patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazl treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients with high-risk therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients treated with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study, more than 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients with Aripiprazl treatment was 17.6% for those suffering from lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase, more than 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients treated with Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, with potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements of CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazl compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects associated with an anti-psychotic therapy, and their occurrence in the treatment with Aripiprazole, include the maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical studies and since the market launch inadvertently or intentional acute overdosages with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without cause of death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the effectiveness of a hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hematalysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose because Aripiprazole has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated on the combination of a partial antagonistic effect on dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HTA receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HTA receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity for dopamine D2 and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a and 5HTA receptor as well as a moderate affinity for dopamine D4-, for alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptors.</seg>
<seg id="76">With the administration of Aripiprazl in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers, positron-emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at Nucleus caudus and at the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, in Week 52 the share of responder patients who retained a response to the study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">A placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a randomly controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, involving 314 patients and in which the primary study target was' weight gain ', an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of approx. 5.6 kg was observed in significantly less patients (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a superior efficacy against placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and actively controlled monotherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazole showed an efficacy in week 3 versus placebo, comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12 Aripiprazole showed a similar proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of mania such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in part did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial of 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole showed superiority to the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyulation of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkylamation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazl for extensive metabolism via CYP2D6 and about 146 hours in poor 'poor' metabolism via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as in a pharmacokinetic study of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A shift-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics did not reveal any clinically significant differences in respect of ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with class C liver cirrhosis, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions to their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety macropology, toxicity in repeated applications, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data did not recognise any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no importance for clinical applications.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent sub-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose (AUC) at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the middle Steady State Exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">Furthermore, a cholelithiasis was found as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the Hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazl in the Galle of apes after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average daily dose or 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of Hydroxy- Aripiprazole found in the human gall have no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the Galle of apes, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of 3 and 11 times the middle Steady State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="145">To increase resorption and to minimise variability, injection into the craniosus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended by bypassing adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines already applied for maintenance or acute treatment (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a secondary oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazole, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify processed tablets or Abilify solution for taking.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiprazl injection solution in patients with aggregation and behavioural disorders caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazl injection solution, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or a blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Tests for the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazl injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (either prescribed or illegal).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used cautiously in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are predisposed for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including akceleried and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia appearing during the treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and heart rhythm disorders).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyuria, polyphaggia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar deficiency because of combination compounds, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedan was higher compared to the after-long administration of Aripiprazole, in a study, in which healthy volunteers were used intra-muscular (15 mg dose) as one-time intramuscular one and the same time they received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intra-muscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blockers, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, although this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In comparison to CYP2D6 'poor' ('poor') metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV- protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be lifted to the dose height before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 lauacepam (2 mg dose) were intra-muscular, the intensity of the sedan was higher compared to the one after the sole administration of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following side effects were more common in clinical studies with Aripiprazole injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: commonly (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side-effects in clinical trials (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those in lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase, more than 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients with Aripiprazl treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, with potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases of CPK (Creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazl compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects associated with an anti-psychotic therapy, and their occurrence in the treatment with Aripiprazole, include the maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazl injection solution associated with statistically significant greater improvements of aggregation / behavioural disorders compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as detachment and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazl injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms with regard to detachment and behavioural problems compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed mean improvement from baseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour end point was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe aggregation, a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined on account of a decreased patient number.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl (orally) showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, in Week 52 the share of responder patients who retained a response to the study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% (orally) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">A placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In a randomly controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, involving 314 patients and in which the primary study target was' weight gain ', an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of ca. 5.6 kg was observed in significantly less patients (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg).</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partially had no psychotic or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole showed superiority to the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the Aripiprazole AUC is 90% larger than the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar to the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the average time required to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The application of Aripiprazl injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure (AUC), which were 15 - or 5 times higher than the maximum human-therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies of reproductive toxicity following IV application, no safety-relevant concerns resulted in maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) over the maximum human-therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on the conventional studies of Aripiprazl (orally) for security harmacology, toxicity in repeated doses, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data did not allow any particular dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans; thus they have limited or no importance for clinical applications.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent sub-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose (AUC) at 60 mg / kg / day (10-times the middle-state-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">Furthermore, a cholelithiasis was found as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of Aripiprazl in the bile after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times average at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81-times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages that led to expositions of 3 and 11 times the middle-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, some of which had received an anthracycline in three quarters earlier.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole application or as monotherapy) was compared with the drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">Overall, 72 (31%) of the 229 patients with Abraxane responded to the treatment, compared with 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">Only patients who have been treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer gave no difference to the efficacy indicators such as time to worsening of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast, patients who previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It must also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) found Abraxane was more effective in patients where the first treatment was no longer considered to be more effective than conventional paclitaxel and that it does not have to be given with other medicines compared to other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted a permit to the Abraxis BioScience Limited company to transport Abraxane across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for a standard anthracycline-containing therapy (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In the case of Neuropathy degree 3, treatment should be interrupted until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">No studies with patients with impaired kidney function were performed and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with impairment of renal function (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for harmlessness and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel that could have significantly different pharmacological characteristics than other formulations of paclitaxel (see section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be removed immediately and a symptomatic treatment is initiated, and the patient must not be treated again with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients, no further Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neutrophils increase to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the platelet number has risen to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunctions (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">Whereas a clearly associated cardiotoxicity was not proven, cardiac occurrences in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with early anthracycline treatment or underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If the patient receives nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea after the gift of Abraxane, these can be treated with the usual anti-inflammatory and constipients.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or women in childbearing age, who do not practice effective contraception, except the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable method of contraception during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to not create a child during and up to six months after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised against the treatment of a sperm conservation, as the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible unfertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very common) and dizziness (often) that can affect the traffic tightness and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in the pivotal Phase III study once every three weeks.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most prominent haematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was fast reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows adverse events associated with the application of Abraxane as monotherapy in every dose and indication (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 100); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased lacttal hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagie, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, hurting gums, loose stool, osophagitis, pain in the lower abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, neck pain, muscle aches, muscle spasms, pain in the skeletal musculature, back pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and there was no causal connection with these events established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubules active substance that supports the interlinking of microtubules from the tubula and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their polymerization.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and mitotic membrane functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 receptor and due to the albumininizing protein SPARC (sected protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the tumor area.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two randomised untreated studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion of 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer for 30 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of a solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2, either in the form of a solvent containing paclitaxel (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2, 30 minutes infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study 64% of patients had a negative overall condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received chemotherapy, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastatic disease and 19% metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First-Line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy degree 3 at a time during the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to sound at baseline based on the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute fusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="316">Exposure to drug exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 According to intravenous dispensing of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The medium distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or turnout of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared with intravenous 30-minute injection of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with the values following a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane application (43%) than after a solvent-containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In published literature about in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers it is reported that paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-diihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean for cumulative urinary excretion was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates far-reaching non-renal clearances.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available to patients at the age of 75, as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">Chemical and physical stability was proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected against light by 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anti-carcinogenic drug and, as with other potentially toxic substances, caution should be taken when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution is slowly injected into a Abraxane water bottle over a period of at least 1 minute (0.9%).</seg>
<seg id="327">After complete encore of the solution, the water bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure good wetting of the solids.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the water bottle should be slowly and carefully swung and / or inverted for at least 2 minutes until complete removal of the powder is carried out.</seg>

<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood glucose levels in which complications may occur in the context of blood transfusion, if a blood loss is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with Remseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be performed by the patient or his supervisor, provided that they have received appropriate instructions.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the emoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron levels of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists, and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by an erythropoietine deficiency, or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's own erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced that empowers them to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">In the case of a major study of 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused anaemia, flamed was compared with the reference medicinal product.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected with Eprex / Erypo at least eight weeks before they were either converted to Abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of effectiveness was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period between 25 and 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of flamed flamed flamed with those of Eprex / Erypo were studied at 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused anaemia, the haemoglobin values of patients that were converted to debillon were maintained to the same extent as those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, stinging migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Debillon should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Flamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) came to the conclusion that for Abseamed according to the regulations of the European Union, evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that produces flamed up will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>

<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion demand in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia in the onset of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in the case of planned larger surgical interventions (4 or more units blood in women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>

<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml, which cannot participate in an autologous blood donor program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients where the haemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Anaemia symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, sex and overall illness burden; therefore, the physician's assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of illness is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual haemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in patients with or below the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the sustained haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure epoetin alfa is used in the lowest permitted dose needed for controlling anemia and anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial anemia is less pronounced (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial anemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week using an intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anaemia symptoms and follow-up may vary depending on age, sex and overall illness burden; therefore, the physician's assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of illness is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest permitted dose needed for control of the anaemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the haemoglobin value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reticular number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be kept three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the index number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg, the haemoglobin value of ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the number of reindeers has increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">On the other hand, the haemoglobin value by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the index number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl over the baseline is unlikely and the treatment should be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood-preserved foods is required, should be obtained twice a week in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">As early as possible, the iron substitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the autologous blood donation program begins, so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the flamed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.E. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before the surgical procedure and on the day of intervention (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should preoperatively preoperatively 300 I.E. / kg each in 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis via the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who fall ill under treatment with some erythropoetin in erythroblastoma (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive a flamed or another erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastomenia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment, instable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (e.g. anamnestically known venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">The application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients with a larger elective orthopaedic surgery: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, carotid or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastomenia (PRCA) Very rarely reported about the occurrence of an antibody mediated PRCA after months to years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of function, defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reticuloquicyte value should be determined and the usual causes of a failure (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium toxicity, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the antibody index is lower (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), thrombocyte and leukocytes are normal, and if no other cause of an active loss is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone marrow for diagnosis of a PRCA should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="413">The immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk of an antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration in section 4.2 should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating active substances (ESA) with a haemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l) were given.</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the application of epoetines if the haemoglobin concentration is increased via the concentration required to control the anaemia symptoms and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of increasing high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure, the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration in section 4.2 should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, does not accelerate progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">For tumor patients with chemotherapy, a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin-alfa and erythropoetin response should be taken into account for the assessment of the therapy efficiency of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is greater than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with paragraph 4.2 (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - dose adaptation with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to apply recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the participation of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients with a larger elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly before the beginning of epoetin-alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing a larger elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate prophylactic prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially with underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial hemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl can be an increased risk of post-operative thrombotic / vascular events.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetine was not proven to improve overall survival for tumor patients or to reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy reduced if hemoglobin target concentration was targeted at 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l)</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dosage should be adapted to the rising hematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there is no indication of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF concerning hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events (cerebral haemorrhage, cerebral infarction), arterial thrombosis, cerebral thromboses, cerebral thrombosis, retinalthromboses, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients with erythropoetin treatment, as well as patients with epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most frequent side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients with erythropoetins.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, patients with cardiovascular disease can lead to thrombotic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations.</seg>

<seg id="572">As the active ingredient in Actua is the same as in Zometa, a portion of the data for Zometa was used to evaluate aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="573">In the first study, nearly 8,000 older women were involved in osteoporosis, and the number of spinal and hip fractures over a period of three years was examined.</seg>
<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 male and female osteoporosis women who recently suffered a hip fracture; the number of fractures over a period of up to five years was examined.</seg>
<seg id="575">In two studies, Actua was tested in two studies on a total of 357 patients and compared with risedronate (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of the efficacy was whether the alkaline phosphatase content in serum (an enzyme that metabolizes bone substance) normalised in the blood or decreased by at least 75% compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients under Actisa (excluding other osteoporosis medicine) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">In comparison to patients under Actisa (with or without other osteoporosis medicine) with placebo the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fracture 9% of patients under Actisa had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most side effects of Actua occur within the first three days after infusion and are less common in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Acetone may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Zoledronics or other bisphosphonate or any other components.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients at Acrelia are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions at the infusion point and osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Actua provides information for doctors who prescribe Actisa to treat osteoporosis, which contains instructions on how to use the medicine, as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="586">Osteoporosis treatment in postmenopausal women and in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • Supplying the contraindication in pregnancy and breastfeeding women • Required of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment • in men with an increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous 5 mg Actisa infusion is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of Aclaa is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Actisa should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the Morbus Paget with Actua, a long remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, corresponding twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of acetlasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclaa infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Actua can be reduced by application of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after application of acetlasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorders (see section 4.4) In patients with a Creatinin Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Actua is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this group of patients is available.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) A dosage adjustment is not necessary as the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Actua are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data is missing for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="599">In patients with severe renal insufficiency (Creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), Actua is not recommended because only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing mortadanaemia is to be treated with sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D before commencement of therapy (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid implementation of the effect of Zoledronic acid on bone conversion, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Actua (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, corresponding twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of acetlasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene should be considered before applying bisphosphonates a dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who need dental procedures, there is no data available whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteoporosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of acetone can be reduced by application of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after application of acetone (see paragraph 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">Cases of atrial fibrillation reported as a serious side effect were increased (1.3%) (51 of 3.862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3.852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Actua (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1000) adverse drug response are listed in table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction of Zoledrona was associated with renal dysfunction, which was associated with kidney function (i.e. an increase of serum creatine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the Creatinin Clearance (measured per year before the administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a restricted renal function were in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years comparable between the placebo and placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatine within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Actua versus 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the assessment of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium levels, which were below the normal swap area (less than 2.10 mmol / l), were observed in 2.3% of patients treated with Actua in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with Actua in the Morbus Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">In addition, all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study of preventing clinical fractures following a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget trials (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study on the prevention of clinical fractures after a litty hip fracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Actua (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions following the administration of Zoledrona acid in a large clinical trial were reported on local reactions at the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonekrosis in the jaw area has been reported, especially in cancer patients, about osteoecroses (primarily in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of the reports relates to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental procedures.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 patients with 7,736 patients treated osteoarthritis in the jaw area in a patient treated with placebo and placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of overdosing, which leads to a clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation of calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate can be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years) has been indicated with either a bone density (BMD) -T-score for the femur ≤ -1.5 and at least two mild or medium-heavy existing spine fractures or a BMD-T-score for the femur ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing spine fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric eddy fractures Actua decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures after one year (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Acacian-treated patients from 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of vertebral fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Actua showed an equally lasting effect over three years which resulted in reduced risk for hip fractures by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Actua increased bone density on lumbar vertebrac acid, hip and distal radius compared to placebo-treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the entire hip by 6.1%, of the scarlet by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">In 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with acetylene (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), bone biopsies were taken from the pelvic body one year after the third annual dose of osteoporosis.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputerised tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the retention of trabecular bone architecture in patients treated with Actua.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone replacement marker The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in the serum and the beta-C telopeptid (b-CTx) in serum were determined in sub-groups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">Treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Actua reduced BSAP by 30% compared to baseline and was kept at 28% below the baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. orally or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortality rate was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Actua, compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, compared to placebo, BMD increased the overall thigh and scarlet at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">In comparison to placebo-treatment, the Actua treatment led to an increase of BMD by 5.4% at the total rump and 4.3% of the placebo arm compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In HORIZON RFT study 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in patients treated with Aclaa compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (CZOL446M2308 study), the once annual administration of acetylene in comparison to the weekly gift of Alendronate was not inferior to the percentage change in the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment with Morbus Paget of the bone Acta was examined in patients at the age of 30 with radiologically confirmed, mainly mild to moderate severe Morbus Paget of the bone (medium serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2.6-fold up to 3.0 times age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledronate acid compared to taking 30 mg of risedronate once daily for 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influences was observed in comparison to the baseline for Actua and Risedronat after 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responses at the end of the six-month primary study (response to therapy) could be included in the follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From 143 with Actua and 107 patients treated with Risedronat patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response at 141 of patients treated with Risedronate could be maintained during an average follow-up period of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes continuous infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledronic acid in 64 patients yielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dosisindependent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Then the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the highest value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h followed by a long period of very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large circulatory cycle with half-life time t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ β-1.87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) probably represent rapid resorption in the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body Clearance amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Zoledron acid concentration at 30% at the end of the infusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearance of metabolized substances by cytochrom-P450 enzyme systems is unlikely, because zoledronic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of the Zoledron acid correlated with the Creatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin Clearance, and was in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min) in 64 patients studied.</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function disorder, down to a Creatinin Clearance down to 35 ml / min, does not require dosage adjustment of the Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since severe kidney failure (Creatinine Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) is restricted to limited data, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-single-acting intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0,6 mg / kg body weight in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies on dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC are 6times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Sub-chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous use, the renal tolerability of Zoledronic acid in rats was obtained by taking doses of 0.6 mg / kg in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7x the human-therapeutic exposure, related to the AUC, corresponds), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in cumulated expositions, which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects on other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, as well as at the intravenous injection site occurred.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common findings in repeated use studies was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphysis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, anti-resorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats, teratogenicity was observed in doses ranging from 0,2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">In rabbits, no teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed, although the maternal toxicity at 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of low serum-calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="672">Declining blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens formed from androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">With the Morbus Paget, bone reconstruction takes place too fast, and new bone material is constructed unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Actua works by normalising the bone structure, ensuring a normal bone formation and thus gives strength to the bone.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are undergoing dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Actisa.</seg>

<seg id="682">Since Actua works for a long time, you may need to take another dose only after one year or longer.</seg>
<seg id="683">It is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood will not be too low in time after infusion.</seg>
<seg id="684">With Morbus Paget you can work for more than one year, and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment.</seg>

<seg id="686">Before completing the therapy with Actua Falls you are considering completing treatment with Actua, please take your next medical appointment and discuss it with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="687">Side effects associated with the first infusion perform very frequently (with more than 30% of patients), but are less common after the subsequent infusions.</seg>
<seg id="688">Fever and chills, muscle or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of Actua.</seg>
<seg id="689">Currently it is unclear whether Actua causes this irregular heartbeat, but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms as you have received aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). it can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially obese patients) where metformin (a diabetes drug) is not shown. • It can be used together with another diabetes drug (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (particularly obese patients) who cannot be satisfied with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dosage.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyresin or insulin, the previous dose of sulfonyotropic acid or insulin can be maintained with the onset of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of the sulfonyl resin or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, which allows type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos was examined in tripletherapy; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos has led to a reduction in HbA1c value, which suggests that the blood sugar levels have been lowered when dosages of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of adding an additional dose of Actos to the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyl resin in lowering HbA1c values decreased by 0.94% while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin was studied in 289 patients, patients who took Actos additionally instructed insulin to decrease HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were blurred vision, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypotheses (reduced sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Pioglitazone or one of the other ingredients, even in patients with liver problems, congestive heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for the transport of Actos across the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is unsuitable for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the application of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports on heart failure, but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other evidence of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values will be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unresolved nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, tiredness, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme values must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pioglitazone should be continued should be presided by clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are presented.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been detected, which can be caused by fatty deposits and is associated with fluid retention in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="776">A minor reduction of the average haemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and haematocrits (relative reduction of 4.1%) was found in the treatment with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies of pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocrits by 3.1-2% and haematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive Pioglitazone as oral double or triple combination therapy with a sulfonyl resin or as a dual combination therapy with insulin receive the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">Following the market launch, the treatment with thiazole indicators, including Pioglitazone, was reported on an occurrence or deterioration of diabetic macular edema with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pioglitazone and the appearance of macular edema, but prescribing doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report on visual acuity disorders; a suitable ophthalmological investigation should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events related to fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence amounted to 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wishes to receive a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is deprecated (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pioglitazone does not exercise relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC from Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in AUC from Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that, under treatment with Pioglitazone, the hyperinsulin resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the uterus decreases, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>

<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary alteration of the tower and the refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone, ALT ascents exceeding the three times the upper limit of the normal range were similar to placebo, but less often than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyotropic.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe heart failure under Pioglitazon was 1.6% higher than placebo if pioglitazone or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since its market launch it has rarely been reported about congestive heart failure under Pioglitazone, but more often when Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events related to fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with Pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients were treated in groups treated with comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In over a period of 3.5 years of ProActive study, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to have an activation of specific core receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator activated Receptor-γ) (PPAR-γ)), leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It has been shown that Pioglitazone is reducing glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose degradation in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazone versus Gliclaxis as monotherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time to follow the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by Pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Gliclaxis).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study lasting more than 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient with insulin for three months were randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c decreased by 0.45% compared to those who continued to receive insulin; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies more than one year, a statistically significant decrease of the albumin / creatinin quotient compared to the baseline values showed consistently under Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabetic patients for 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo, a reduction of total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels as well as slightly but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced total plasmatoglycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or gliclaxis and increased the HDL cholesterol level.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to Plazebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazone whereas low levels were observed under metformin and gliclaxis.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the nüchtern triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, both with an effect on triglyceride absorption and hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomised in groups who received either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral appliance pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, with the peak concentrations of unmodified Pioglitazone in the plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to the effectiveness of about three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it was possible to demonstrate that Pioglitazone does not have a relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactive pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the crop (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma elimination period of unaltered Pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours in humans, and that of the total active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced renal function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of the oral Clearance of the parent substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">Toxicological studies were consistent with mice, rats, dogs and apes after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric cardiac hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with Pioglitazone the hyper insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the uterus are reduced, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the bladder epithelium were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other thiazole india led to an increased incidence of colonic tumors.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazone, compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with either pioglitazone or gliclaxis were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies more than 1 year, a statistically significant decrease of the albumin / creatinin quotient compared to the baseline values showed consistently under Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks Pioglitazone reduced not only the nüchtern triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, this both over an effect on the tryglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic Tryglizeride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study missed the target with regard to its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortality, non-mortal myocardial infarction, amputation above the ankles, coronary revascularisation and revascularisation of the leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular long-term risks are associated with taking Pioglitazone.</seg>

<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of Actraphane may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (see the full list of the packages).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Actraphane were outweighed in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">October 2002, the European Commission granted Novo Nordisk A / S a licence for the transport of Actraphane across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed isinsulin products are normally used once or twice daily, if a fast initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly, for example, by intensified insulin therapy, can perceive the hypoglycaemia symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change regarding strength, brand (producer), type of insulin (fast acting, biphasic, long-acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analogon) and / or manufacturing method (through recombinant DNA to insulin-animal origin) can cause a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dosage adjustment is required when changing to Actraphane in the patient, it may be necessary at first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling across several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor, as such trips can lead to insulin and meals being used or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions during the therapy and ask his patients to always ask for other medications taken from them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycemia, which can occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetesis, increase the risk of abnormalities and frustration in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemias can lead to unconsciousness and / or seizures and end with temporary or permanent brain function disorders and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Nervous system diseases - Peripheral neuropathy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with discomfort known as acute painful neuropathy and usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5. intensification of insulin therapy with an abrupt improvement of the blood sugar level can, however, be associated with a temporary deterioration in diabetic retinopathy.</seg>

<seg id="884">General illnesses and complaints at the site of the administration - Local hypersensitivity reactions at the injection site During insulin therapy, local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, soreness and haematoma at the injection site) can occur.</seg>
<seg id="885">Diseases of the immune system - Urticaria, Exanthem Very rarely - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity, including generalized rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angioneurotic edema, heart palpitations, low blood pressure and fainting / unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="886">Hypoglycaemia may develop gradually: • Light hypoglycemias can be treated by oral supplements of glucose or sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape sugars, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by an instructed helper or by glucose, which is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect begins within half an hour, the maximum amount is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total amount of action is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin-products with quick and delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of split (hydrolysis) places on the human-insuline molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the splitting are active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional studies on safety macropology, toxicity in repeated doses, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data does not reveal any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after removing the Actraphane water bottle from the refrigerator - to increase the insulin temperature at room temperature (not above 25 ° C) before being resusedulted according to the instructions for the first use.</seg>

<seg id="1188">Liver disease During phase 3 clinical studies light abnormalities of liver function were observed in patients treated with Febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before starting the basebuxotic treatment and in the course of the procedure (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline was not performed at Febuxostat, but it is known that XO inhibition can lead to an increase in theophylutrient (an inhibition of theophylline metabolism was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In the case of subjects, simultaneous administration of Febuxostat and naproxen 250 mg 2 x daily was associated with an increase in Febuxostats exposure (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical studies the application of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with clinically significant increase of adverse events.</seg>

<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage return of serum diuretic acid concentrations in subjects, despite their renal function (58% in the group with normal renal function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum diuretic concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of Etwa 40% of patients (APEX and FACT study) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of studies (baseline).</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data gathered in the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum concentration levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of rheumatism in the months 16-24 (i.e. more than 97% of patients did not need treatment against ggering).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the gout, which resulted in 54% of patients a complete disappearance of the lymph nodes by month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Elevated TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients receiving long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and in patients who received allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long-term extension studies (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy volunteers, the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of Febuxostat increased proportionally after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is greater than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the Cmax amounts to approximately 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5,3 µg / ml.</seg>

<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microsomes showed that these oxidative metabolites are mainly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostatelglucuronid is mainly produced by UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After taking a 80 mg dose of 14C-marked Febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose in the urine was found as immutable febuxostat (3%), its well-known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%) as well as other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over the urine, approximately 45% of the dose was found in the chair as immutable febuxostat (12%), Acylglucuronid of the active substance (1%), its well-known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%) as well as other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Specific patient groups of renal insufficiency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal insufficiency, the Cmax of Febuxostat did not change in relation to subjects with normal renal function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The mean total AUC of Febuxostat increased by approximately 1.8-times of 7.5 m and h / ml in the group with normal renal function to 13.2 μ g and h / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1236">12 Liver Dysfunction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (Child- Pugh classification B) Liver dysfunction altered the Cmax and AUC of Febuxostat and its metabolites not significantly compared to normal liver function subjects.</seg>

<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats, a statistically significant increase of urinary bladder tumours (transition cell papillomas and carcinomas) was found only in connection with Xanthin stones in the highly dosed treated group, approximately 11 times the exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of specific purinmetabolization and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It was noted that Febuxostat has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1241">In case of high doses, which lay approximately in 4-times the human-therapeutic exposure, maternal toxicity occurred, which was accompanied by a reduction in the rearing performance and a developmental delay in the offspring of rats.</seg>

<seg id="1278">Since Alendronate and vitamin D3 can be used separately from each other in medicines approved in the European Union, the company submitted data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of ADROVANCE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those who only received alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data suggesting that the Alendronat dose of ADROVANCE is exactly the same as the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (digestive disorders), ulcers (Ulcera) of the oesophagus, dyspepsia (diarrhea), tapered abdomen (inflated abdomen) as well as saures.</seg>

<seg id="1288">Follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and associated side effects (see section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• After opening the day ADROVANCE is to be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml). • Patients should not chew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcera. • The patients should not lie down before the first intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1290">E.g. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper gastrointestinal tract except pyloroplasty, only be given under special care (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal striklines, were reported in patients under the intake of Alendronate (partially these were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible esophageal reactions and patients should be advised to obtain the medicine at the occurrence of symptoms of esophageal irritation such as dysphaggia, pain in swallowing or retroglobalizing heartburn and seek medical advice (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of serious esophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue taking it after symptoms that indicate esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical trials with alendronate no increased risk was detected, gastric and duodenal ulcera, among them some severe and complications, were reported (see section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure to tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of adverse events, including under- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; constellations of the formulation or the régime should only be performed under close inspection of an experienced physician (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">Following a changeover to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advanagraf should primarily be based on clinical assessment of severance and tolerability in individual cases and on blood mirroring (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advanf, the tacrolimus-level mirrors should be checked before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Meticulous and repeated checks of the Tacrolimus Valley Mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplant under Advanf to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate postoperative transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since tacrolimus is a substance with low clearance, an adjustment of the Advanf can take several days until the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">In order to suppress the graft rejection, immunosuppression has to be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - Kidney transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advanagraf therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosage adjustment can be necessary later as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change during the course of stabilization of the patient after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advance Therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - switch from Prograf to Advanf must be converted from twice daily dosage of Prograf Capsules to a once daily intake of Advanagraf, so this change in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the entire daily dose, must be performed.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After a change from other immunosuppressant to Advanf once a day, the treatment with the oral initials recommended in kidney and liver transplants must begin with the transplant prophylaxis.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant In adult patients, who are switched to Advanf, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once daily in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with advocates in lung, pancreatic and bowel transplants, occurred in an oral initialdose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day for pancreatic transplants in an oral initialdose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initialdose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood transmissions in the targeted area, a reduction of the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver dysfunctions.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function exerts no influence on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the renal function (including regular determination of serum creatine levels, a calculation of the creatinine and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover from Ciclosporin to Advanf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy is advisable (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations for the blood level in thoroughbred The dose should primarily be based on clinical assessment of severance and tolerability in individual cases by means of whole blood-tacrolimus-level controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to carry frequent checks of the Tacrolimus Valley Mirror during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-sebum levels of tacrolimus should also be controlled after conversion from prograf to Advanf, dosage adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or at the same time using substances which could change the whole blood sugar concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advanagraf is a medicine with a low clearance, adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Steady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the level of sebum in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the spinal level of tacrolimus in full blood in the first time after liver transplantation is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant receivers, blood concentrations were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects that may occur as a result of tacrolimus or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; constellations of the formulation or the régime should only be performed under close inspection of an experienced physician (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are still no clinical data for the retarded formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">No clinical data for the retarded formulation Advagraf is available for prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant receivers and transplant receivers in childhood.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, taking herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other herbal remedies during treatment with Advanf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered, as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a chamber or septum hypertrophie designated as cardiomyopathy was to be observed, which can therefore occur under Advanagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunctions, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of maligner skin lesions by suitable clothing or use of a sun protection device with a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and therefore increase or decrease the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while simultaneously offering substances that can change the metabolism of the CYP3A and adjust the tacrolimus dose to maintain uniform concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction has been achieved with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, Itraconazole and Voriconazole as well as with the Macrod antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or decrease the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other drugs tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can impair their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid-contraceptives and thus increase the hormone exposure, it is necessary to carefully proceed cautiously in decisions concerning contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal studies have shown that tacrolimus could potentially reduce the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and extend their half-time.</seg>

<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, low water solubility and high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, tacrolimus is not dialyable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects At the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus are likely to be mediated by binding to a cytosolitic protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection in the cellular interior.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent suspension of signal transduction pathways in the T cell, preventing transcription of a certain number of lymphocytes genes.</seg>

<seg id="1486">In patients treated with tacrolimus, it came to 21.7% of cases for the formation of a bronchiolitis obliterans compared to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which Ciclosporin had to be changed to tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly larger (p = 0.02) than the number of patients encircled by tacrolimus on Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute graft rejection was greater after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in lung transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the frequency of the emergence of a bronchiolitis obliteraci- syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multicenter trial with oral prograf was conducted to 205 patients who simultaneously received a pancreas and kidney transplantation based on a randomised procedure tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound faction of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for higher clearances observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, with excretion mainly via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In stable patients, who were converted from prograf (twice daily) to Advanf (once daily) in proportion 1: 1 (mg: mg) related to the total daily dose, systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advocates are used to treat and prevent haemorrhages in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder due to the lack of Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether advocates are used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clots like bleeding in the joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is produced according to a method called recombinant DNA:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, enabling them to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another in the European Union named Recombinate, but is produced differently so that the drug does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study of 53 children under 6 years, the use of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of Advate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new hemorrhages with "excellent" or "good" was evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG approval for the transport of lawyers across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of the Factor VIII-deficiency, the place and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the case of subsequent hemorrhagic events, the Factor VIII-activity will not fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients less than 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injections repeat every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk of the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, an appropriate determination of the Factor VIII plasma level is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII, achieve various in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the Factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The transfer speed should be based on the patient's condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against Factor VIII is a well known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always opposed to the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma using modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to Factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 expositions is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">After switching from a recombinant Factor VIII product to another, the re-occurrence of (low-tide) inhibitors was observed in pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 expositions and anamnestically known inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there is no experience of using factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs, which occur in the largest number of patients, were inhibitors to Factor VIII (5 patients) showing a higher risk of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>

<seg id="1559">The blood clotting was maintained throughout the period and both the Factor VIII- Mirror in the plasma and the Clearance rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical studies with ADVATE on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosis of severe to moderate Hämophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and prior exposure to Factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days), only one patient showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in modified Bethesda approach) after 26 expositions.</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of 6 years and diagnosed with severe to moderate Hämophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) after previous exposure to Factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days) found a FVIII inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1562">In the previously untreated patients, 5 out of 25 (20%) treated with ADVATE were inhibitors to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of the patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining antibodies against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of the antibody-level against anti-CHO cell proteins, but otherwise no signs or symptoms appeared which were referred to an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the incidence of urticaria, pellitus, skin rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes in several repeated product expositions were reported in the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since initial approval, CHMP continued to evaluate the benefit-risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP based on the security profile of ADVATE, which necessitates a submission of PSURs every 6 months, has decided that the authorisation holder is to apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited officially informed the Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the Company will withdraw its application for the marketing of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni Cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft parts (tissue that connects, surrounds and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus," which has been modified to produce no copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin should have been injected directly into the tumors, allowing cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein found out of the p53 gene in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In the case of Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study involving a patient with the Li-Fraumeni-Cancer in the substructure, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP checked the company's answers to the questions asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of the submitted documents, the CHMP generates a list of questions sent to the company day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin injection in Li-Fraumeni tumors benefits patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "modified active substance release" "" "means that the tablets are so compound that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal passages caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosal swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice daily a tablet, which should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminate as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clarified.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be traced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main functional measures were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, patients who received Aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in the patients who received pseudoephedrine on their own.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients under Aerinaze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% versus 26.7% in the patients who received distillation alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia, mouth-dried, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (drowsiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or one of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or lauatadin (another drug for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">It must also not be used in patients who suffer from narrow angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular disease including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyrophy), hyperthyroidism (cerebral haemorrhage) or a risk of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval for the transport of Aerinaze to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data on the safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as long-term use can decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After reduction of the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper airways, treatment can be continued as a monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Because Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, ergotamine, Dihydrogamin, methyl propane, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, nhazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient's collective and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunctions and the data is insufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients need to be informed that treatment with hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, heart rhythm disorders, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or amplification of headache) must be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with heart rhythm disorders • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck obstruction or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze must be carried out at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, as antihistamines otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical trials with desloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with placebo and placebo, regardless of whether or not they were taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of distillate adin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of Aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, but experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies showed no increase in the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, Aerinaze should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a dizziness which may result in an impairment of road damage or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanose, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, complicated mimition, muscle weakness, increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, vision disturbances and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupillary rigidity and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia, and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecules P-Selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance, including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, no increased frequency of sleepiness was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets was significantly higher than under one monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in patient subgroups according to gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, it is detectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the fluid balance of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four volunteers underwent desloratadin poorly.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine bioequivalent was an exposure to the gift of an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety macropology, toxicity in repeated applications, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadine do not identify any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the substance pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits at a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and the Pharmacovigilance System described in module 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the relief of the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's substance that can unfold its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets alleviate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) such as sneezing, running or itching nose and tears or itching eyes while constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Inform your doctor if there are following symptoms or illnesses diagnosed or diagnosed with Aerinaze: • High blood pressure • heartbeat, heart palpitations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headaches or amplification of existing headache.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin very rare cases of severe allergic reactions (breath not, whistling breathing, itching, hives, swelling) or skin rashes were reported.</seg>
<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart hunts, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, dizziness, insomnia, muscle aches, varicose cases, cases of liver inflammation and about cases of eye-catching liver irritation was also reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg / ml of lyophilisate for intake (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, which in the form of 2.5 ml syrup and syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies to patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by determining the change in symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrangganing, sleep and performance in the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body evaluates the syrup, the solution to the insertion and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius resulted in an average decrease in the symptom (number of symptoms) by 25 to 32%, compared to 12 to 26% decrease in the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two trials of Urticaria, the reduction of the total score after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% was compared with 40 and 33% in the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against desloratadin, Loratadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval for the transport of Aerius across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with or without a meal, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the previous disease progression and can be terminated upon returning the symptoms and can be resumed at their return.</seg>
<seg id="1732">The persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions haven't been found in clinical studies with Desloratadin tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">A clinically-pharmacological study did not increase the performance of alcohol (see section 5.1) while taking acerius and alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to dizziness which may result in an impairment of road damage or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in different indications including allergic rhinitis and chronically idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more often than placebo were fatigue (1,2%), dry mouth dryness (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 adolescent patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common adverse event was headaches; this occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with disaster and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study, where up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times a clinical dose) were administered, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophile as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecules P-Selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In the course of a clinical study involving multiple doses, administered intravenously over 14 days in a dose of up to 20 mg, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no prolongation of the Qtc interval was shown.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance, including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving the symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the overall results of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was substituted for other forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, despite the etiology of the different forms, is similar and chronic patients can be recruited easily prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Because histamine is an causative factor in all of the urticarial diseases, it is expected that, apart from the chronic idiopathic urticaria, in other forms of urticaria, it is expected to improve the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies of 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of prematitus and the reduction of size and number of quadrilaterals at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the majority of patients who did not respond to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the itch by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with the desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and wakefulness as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which patients were compared with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications of clinically relevant cumulation after a daily application of distillate adin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the distillate adin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs are not completely excluded.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aperius can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that there is no data to support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">Apart from the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies, the anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. issued official approval to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company withdraws its application for the marketing of Aflunov on the prevention of the aviar H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Influenza pandemic outbreak occurs when a new strain of the flu virus arises, which can easily be spread from human to human because humans have not yet built immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After the vaccine is administered, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This means that the immune system is later able to form antibodies in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane covering of the virus was separated with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognises as foreign), purified and used as part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">Therefore, the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are interested in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment, please contact your attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like more information on the CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution for use, but it cannot be taken together with ritonavir because the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked which antiviral medication the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood is that the virus is addressed to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily, which together with twice daily 100 mg of kritonavir and with other antiviral medicines are taken.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between 4 and 12 years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenerase reduces the HIV amount in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Aids can not cure AIDS, but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases related to AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two primary studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This medicine, enhanced with low dose kritonavir, was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used to take protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in virus load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml of less than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, with only very few of the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, responded only very few to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the medicine Agenerase used Ritonavir increased the viral load as effectively as other protease inhibitors after 16 weeks of treatment:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, it came together with Ritonavir together with Ritonavir for a stronger drop in the viral load after four weeks as in the patients who continued their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against amprenavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase must not be used in patients, St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or drugs that are broken down in the same way as agenase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, there is a risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (bone tissue death) or immune activation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1-infected adults and children treated with protease inhibitors prevail over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic enhancer Ritonavir, but the Committee noted that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally authorised under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued approval for the company Glaxo Group Limited for the transport of Agenerase across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medications for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Generally speaking, Agenerase capsules should be administered to pharmacokinetic boosters of amprenavir along with low doses of kritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should be done taking into account the individual viral load pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% less than from Amprenavir as capsule; hence, Agenerase capsules and solution for use on a milligram per milligram base are not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg Amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg of kritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medications.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the enhancing addition of kritonavir (boosted), higher doses of asbestos (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asurease in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under the age of 4, due to the lack of data on the harmlessness and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be treated with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">"" "" "" "Agenerase must not be given at the same time with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width and also represent the substrates of the cytochrome P450 Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1938">Vegetable preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amprenavir during the intake of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">Current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenerase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">In general, Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of kritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences.</seg>
<seg id="1943">In case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing reduced liver function including chronic-active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenerase and kritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids, which are metabolised via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing and suppressor of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some drugs that cause serious or life threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoine, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regised Ratio), methods are available to determine the concentration of active substances.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking these medicines at the same time, Agenerase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">When methadone is given at the same time with amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored for eye removal symptoms, especially if low doses of kritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propyl alcohol content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be removed in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases in which drugs were needed to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. a higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, there are reports of an increase in hemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemthrosis.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections that lead to serious clinical condition or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial etiology (including corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoarthritis were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or longterm use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width should not be given at the same time with medicines which have low therapeutic width and also represent the substrates of the Cytochrome P450 Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir must not be combined with medicines, whose active ingredients are mainly metabolised via CYP2D6 and are linked to increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir that can lead to virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In trying to compensate the degraded plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with ritonavir, undesirable effects on the liver were often observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes Johanniskraut, the amprenavircular mirror and, if possible, check the virus load and replace the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if nelfinavir is administered together with Amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">Increased by 30% for Cmax, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) in combination with Amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg Amprenavir were used twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily that attest to the efficacy and safety of this treatment schema.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower when Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of kritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma, which have been achieved twice a day in the combination of Amprenavir (600 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of kritonavir twice daily) are about 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and caletra can not be given, but a close monitoring is recommended because the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out in combination with didanosin, but due to the antazidis component of Didanosin it is recommended that the revenues of Didanosine and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), dosage adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that nevirapin possibly reduces the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Should these medicines be used at the same time, be careful as delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological surveillance should be carried out, as an exact prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and kritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amprenavir and rifabutin resulted in an increase in the plasma concentration (AUC) of Rifabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in doses of rifabutin will go to at least half the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data for this.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with assays in combination with erythromycin have not been carried out, but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the event of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole per day led to an increase in the Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2,69times in comparison to the value observed once daily without simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other drugs that are listed below may possibly cause interactions, including substrates, inhibitors, or inductors of CYP3A4, if used together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines, when applied in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors it is advisable that antacids should not be taken at the same time as Agenerase as it may result in resorption errors.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulants known as enzyme inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amnedipine, ditiazem, felodipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine,</seg>
<seg id="1986">Concurrent consumption with Agenerase can considerably increase its plasma concentrations and amplify the side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days, the fluoresonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval from 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous use of Agenerase with kritonavir together with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic cortical cortical effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">For HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected with simultaneous administration of Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of this drug is not recommended with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Frequent monitoring of the therapeutic levels is recommended to stabilize the mirrors as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous administration of amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase must not be used together with orally biased midazolam (see section 4.3) while cautious while using Agenerase with parenteral mdazolam caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other proteaseinases point to a possible increase in plasma levels of Midazolam around 3-4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadone is administered together with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored for eye removal symptoms, especially if low doses of kritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation on how to adjust the dose of amprenavir if amprenavir is given at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, increased control of the INR (International Regised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of kritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictably so alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended with simultaneous administration of Agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk lactating rats, amprenavir-related substances have been proven, but it is not known whether Amprenavir passes into breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study on pregnant rats, administered by the evaporation into the uterus to the end of the lactation period, showed a diminished increase in 12 body weight in posterity.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of seed, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the dam.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenerase was studied in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, occurred early and rarely lead to abrupt treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events are not clarified whether they are in connection with the intake of Agenerase or another medicine applied to HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg of asurease twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as well as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as laboratory alterations (grade 3 to 4) occur in the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of the body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and facial fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of breasts and dorsoc fat accumulation (stitching).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral unpretreated persons treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (sticking) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the PROAB 3006 study, 245 patients treated patients with amprenavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients with indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes usually were slightly pronounced, erythematous or macrocosous nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Amprenavir had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteoarthritis was reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg Agenerase twice daily along with low dosed Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of adverse events (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable to those who received asurease along with low dose kritonavir, very often occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdosing, the patient is to observe signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supporting measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the process of viral gene and gag pol- Polyproteinprecursors with the result of an immature, non infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated both in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronic infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The relationship between the activity of amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral unpretreated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other ritonavir-based treatment schemas with proteaseinase inhibitors - the mutations described rarely were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral diluted patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of kritonavir twice daily in the study ESS100732, a virological failure occurred up to 48, with 14 isolates genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients with protease inhibitors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>

<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg of Ritonavir twice a day: n = 107) with protease inhibitors, patients with virological failure occurred over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Phenotypic interpretation systems based on genotypic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, V82A / C / F / V, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenotypic resistance to fossils with kritonavir and a reduced likelihood of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic interpretation systems based on phenotypic resistance testing can be used in combination with the genotypic data to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic patterns associated with a reduced sensitivity to amprenavir creates a certain crusade resistance to Ritonavir, but the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir stays in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 fossiamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral unpretreated patients, in which a Fosamprenavir had failed (one of them demonstrated a resistance to Lopinavir and Saquavir (three out of 25 isolates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 insulates), saquinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 insulates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, Amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitors-resistant isolates; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early abortion of a promising therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a multitude of mutations within limits, which can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which with PI pretreated adults after virological failure (100 mg twice daily) and Nucleosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low dose kritonavir "oostert."</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity towards Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-inferiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group with regard to time-admised average change from baseline (HIV-1-RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-underlay threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of efficacy of unleavened Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled studies involving 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenera's solution to intake and capsules in dosages of 15 mg / kg was examined three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low-dose knight avir was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks about 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to baseline.</seg>

<seg id="2043">After oral administration the average duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Amprenavir amounts approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">Increased by 30% for Cmax, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">Administration of amprenavir with a meal results in a 25% decrease in AUC but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the scale and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 litres (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be placed on a large distribution volume as well as an unimpeded penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unbundled amprenavir that represents the active portion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of the free active component fluctuates during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4, or a substrate of CYP3A4, must be administered with caution when given at the same time with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, results in a similar daily amprenavir exposure such as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is made from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; hence, Agenerase Solution and Agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram base.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, therefore the effect of a renal function disorder should be limited to the elimination of amprenavir and kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to amprenavir plasma levels similar to those who are achieved twice a day after a dose of 1200 mg amprenavir twice a day without the simultaneous administration of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies of carcinogenicity with mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas occurred in male animals, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8 times (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">From the present exposure data on humans, both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application, there were little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, which included bacterial reverse mutation tests, mouse lymphom test, microkernel test on rats and chromosomal aberrations tests on human peripheral lymphocytes, Amprenavir was neither mutagen nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Until now, no significant liver toxicity in patients has been observed in clinical studies, neither during administration nor after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young animals, which were treated at an age of 4 days, showed a high mortality both in the control animals and in the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly lower (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dose in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus elongation and minor skeletal changes were observed, which point to delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the enhancing addition of ritonavir (boosted), higher doses of asbestos (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with moderate or slight liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some drugs that cause serious or life threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoine, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regised Ratio), methods are available to determine the concentration of active substances.</seg>

<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma, which have been achieved twice a day in the combination of Amprenavir (600 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of kritonavir twice daily) are about 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">A dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and caletra can not be given, but a close monitoring is recommended because the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these drugs are used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological surveillance should be carried out, as an exact prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and kritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>

<seg id="2078">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenerase, increased control of the INR (International Regised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg of Norethindron) led to a decline in the AUC and Cmin from Amprenavir by 22%, respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2086">On the other hand, Amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitors-resistant isolates; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>

<seg id="2197">If it is necessary due to the patient's complaints or due to the severity of local skin reactions, a treatment period of several days may be made.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Since there are currently no data on long-term cure rates of more than 36 months after the treatment, other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in superficial basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">There are no clinical experience in patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs, therefore the application is not recommended in pre-treated tumours.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study suggest that large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2) are less likely to respond to Imiquimiodine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod has not been studied for the treatment of actin keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or lip area within the lips.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Very limited data on the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of actin keratoses on anatomical places outside the face and scalp are available.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratose on the underarms and hands does not support the efficacy in this application, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions often occur, but these reactions usually decrease in intensity in the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong, the treatment may be exposed for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical trial showed that patients with more than 8 patients showed a lower total healing rate than patients with fewer than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immunostimulatory properties, Imiquimod cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) can be quantified neither after one-time nor after multi-time topical application, there is no recommendation to apply during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly shared and possibly or possibly with the application of Imiquimod-cream related adverse events in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the place of treatment of the incision (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimodine).</seg>

<seg id="2215">The side effects reported by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical trials of phase III with Imiquimiodine-cream treated patients with actin keratose are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The evaluation of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that these placebo-controlled clinical studies with Imiquimod cream frequently lead to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excreation / flaps / flaps (23%) and edema (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">According to the test plan, the clinical signs presented according to the test plan show that with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimiodine, severe erosions (13%), severe erosions (13%), and severe scarring and salvage (19%) occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies investigating the use of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinan keratose, alopecia was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The inadvertent orale absorption of 200 mg Imiquimodine, which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags, could cause nausea, vomiting, headaches, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, was in hypotonia which normalized after oral or intravenous dosages.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic study, systemic concentrations of alpha-interferon and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of Imiquimiodine.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies, efficacy in relation to a complete healing of tendencies in iodine-iodine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo-treatment is clearly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">At 60% of the patients who were treated with Imiquimiodine, the patients healed completely; this was the case with 20% of the 105 patients who were treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 patients treated with imiquimiodine, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo-treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of iodine odine for five-time application per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficial basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data obtained from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that around 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and stayed for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod over three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>

<seg id="2230">The single-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrent rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications Outer Feignizen, actin keratose and superficial basal cell carcinoma normally do not appear in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Creme was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies of children between 2 and 15 years with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the dosages studied there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more)</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic uptake of the 5% imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with actin keratosis was observed during the three-week application for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 pouch), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 hours half-life after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Systemic exposure data showed that the absorption of Imiquimodine after topical application on MC-diseased skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with acute keratose or superficial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study carried out for four months for dermal application yielded no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice on three days a week did not induce tumors at the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The appropriate mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a low systemic absorption of the human skin and is not mutagen, there is a risk for the human being to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the substance-free cream, previously and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyms is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms which are not associated with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, which complicate movements, reduce lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyms should be performed in a hospital or clinic with revitalization equipment, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly investigates the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness was also measured (by examining the effect related to reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the liver's size).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years of age, Aldurazyms lowered GAG concentrations in the urine by around 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), feeling of heat, fever and reactions at the infusion office.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients less than five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement magnitude of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyms may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be known each year, and update this summary, where necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">Aldurazyme is a manufacturer of patients who receive aldurazyms with regard to the reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the transport of Aldurazyms across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, Eierstock of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyms is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where recovery facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">As a result of the clinical phase III study, it is expected that nearly all patients form IgG antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience in the recovery of treatment after a longer break, it is necessary to cautiously proceed cautiously due to the theoretically increased risk of a hypersensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before commencement of infusion with medications (antihistamines and / or antipyretics) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a slight or moderate infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion has to be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be rerecorded with a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procain because there is a potential risk of interferency with intracellular absorption of Laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not preclude direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns exposed to Laronidase about breast milk are present, it is recommended not to breastfeed with Aldurazyme during treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical studies were predominantly classified as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in the context of Aldurazyme, which were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years, are shown in the following table according to the following abundances: very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions also occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing standstill and facial edema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted Drug Effects in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with predominantly severe trial form and duration of treatment up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, a Seroconian version occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment, with a severe sequential form usually within one month to a Seroconian version (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 trial (or up to a premature withdrawal from the study), 13 / 45 patients showed no antibodies (RIP) assay, including 3 patients who had never come to Serokony.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low to low antibody levels reported a robust reduction in the GAG level in the urine, while a variable reduction of GAG in urine was observed in patients with high antibody titres.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing effect on enzymatic Laronidase- activity in vitro, which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of undesirable drug reactions, even though the occurrence of undesirable drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reasoning of the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated sub-strata and the prevention of a further accumulation of sufficient replenishment of the enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyms were examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the whole range of illnesses, the majority of patients were of the middle-phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FeV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for effectiveness were the percentage change in the expected FeV and the total distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyms every week for 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and capacity, which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as highlighted in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FeV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased proportionally to the size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of 26 patients with a hepatoma prior to treatment 22 (85%) to the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear decrease of the GAG Mirror was observed in the urine (µg / mg Kreatinin), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous manifestation of the disease between the patients, which was taken into consideration by using a combined end point, the clinically significant change of five efficacy variables (reduced in 6-minute hearing test, range of motion of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), was generally observed in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age at the time of their inclusion (16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- Mirror in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were observed after the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe course of course (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed normal mental development speed, whereas in older patients with severe course of course only limited or no progress in cognitive development were to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations into pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosing regimens were performed at the GAG Mirror in the urine, liver volume and 6-minute hearing test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile of patients under the age of 5 was similar to that in older and less severely affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2349">In some patients with severe MPS-IV-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, however, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing standstill and facial edema.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Very common (occurrence with more than 1 out of 10 patients): • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • joint pain, joint pain, back pain, pain in the arms and legs • increased pulse • hypertension • less oxygen in the blood • response at the infusion office</seg>
<seg id="2351">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually, and if necessary, the packages template will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2352">If the ready-to-use preparation is not used immediately, it cannot be stored for longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8º C if the dilution was under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2353">Preparation of the Aldurazyme infusion (using aseptic technique) • first determine the number of diluent flow bottles according to the body weight of each patient.</seg>
<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another medicine against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (medicines for cancer) and "malignant" (cancer has already spread to other parts of the body). • advanced or metastatic "non-small" lung cancer that does not attack the squamous cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole therapy in patients who have not previously been treated, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who previously received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, patients should take a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, a "anti-cancer" (medicine against vomiting) and fluids (in order to prevent fluid deficiency) should be given before or after the gift of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood pressure changes or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, stopped or the dose is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of telemetrexed thus slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of telemetrexed into its active form is more readily available in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the medicine and a longer active life in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural othelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy, with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another medicine against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survive an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months at the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time was 8.3 months compared with docetaxel at 7.9 months.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in which cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells, in the administration of Alimta, had longer survival rates than with the comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the transport of Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each punch bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a resolution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the water bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see paragraph 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with lo- ally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is given intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion over a period of 2 hours after the end of the telemetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is given intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid should be given the day before and on the day of the telemetrexed dose and the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of pemetremixed at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake should be continued throughout the duration of the therapy as well as for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) per week before the first pemetrexed dose and after every third operation cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving telemetrexed, a complete blood-image should be created before each gift, including a differentiation of leukocytes and platelet count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose check must take place taking into consideration the Nadir of the blood-image or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the predicted therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated in accordance with the indications in Tables 1, 2 and 3 which are to be applied for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC level 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-hematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA has to be stopped if a haematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose-reductio- tendons or so- at the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies did not indicate that patients at the age of 65 yrs or over the age of 65 have an increased risk of adverse effects.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for harmlessness and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials there were no dosage adjustment in patients with a Creatinin Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dosage adjustment recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin clearance of less than 45 ml / min was insufficient; therefore, the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubin- limit value and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (in the case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients have to be monitored with regard to bone marression and pemetremixed should not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophils again reach a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the platelet number returns a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutrophils, platelet number and maximum non-haematological toxicity observed in previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in degrees of 3 / 4 haematological and non-matological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenia were considered o-obtrusive when a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore all patients treated with telemetremixed must be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (Creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous ingestion of non-steroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs) for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients for which a telemetrexed therapy is foreseen must avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, a drainage of the effusion in front of the telemetrexed treatment should be considered in patients with a clinically significant accumulation of fluid in the transcellular space.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 severe cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials using telemetrexed, when this ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible reduction of reproductive capacity by pemetrexed, men should be advised to seek advice regarding the sperm conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal renal function (Creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of non-steroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid can lead to reduced telemetremixed excretion resulting in increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore caution is recommended if high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses should be applied in patients with normal renal function (Creatinin Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses for at least 2 days prior to therapy, to be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with pemetremixed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application must be avoided using telemetremixed for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with telemetric.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy demands an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Regised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of telemetremixed in pregnant women, but as with ande- ren antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Telemetrexed may not be applied during pregnancy except when essential and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk of foetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible deterioration of reproductive capacity is due to pemetrexed, men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the block preservation.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether telemetrexed is transferred to breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and randomised Cisplatin and telemetrexed, as well as 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomised to receive Cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (telemetrexed) is a antineoplastic antifolate that exerts its effect by stopping short-term, acid-dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that telemetrexed works as an antifolate with multiple targets by inhibiting the thymidylatsynthase (TS), Dihydrofolate reductase (GARFT), the folate-dependent enzymes of de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purin- ucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, easy-blind stage 3 study of ALIMTA plus Cisplatin against cisplatin in chemonaiven patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma showed that with ALIMTA and Cisplatin, patients had clinically meaningful advantage of survival compared to those patients who were only caucately cautioned with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">Primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients who received the investigational medication (randomised and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement of clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) in connection with the malignant pleural aresothelioma was shown in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients) in relation to the single Cisplottin arm (218 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2436">The differences between the two arms resulted in an improvement in lung function parameters in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm and a deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm.</seg>
<seg id="2437">A multicentre, randomised, open phase III trial with ALIMTA in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy was median survival of 8.3 months in patients treated with ALIMTA (Intent to treat population n = 283) and patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288).</seg>

<seg id="2504">Patients who take Alli and do not have weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they cannot break down some fats in the food, resulting in about a quarter of the fats fed with the food undigested by the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study Alli was compared to placebo in 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In the two studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who received Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after a year versus 2,3 kg in taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">The study of alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for the patients with relevant weight loss.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily patches on after, flatus (winch) with step labyrinth, bowstring, oily / oily chair, leaving oily secretion (rotting), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It must not be used in patients who are treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with drugs such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may not be used in patients suffering from long-term malabsorption syndrome (in which insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract) or in cholesterol (liver disease), and pregnant or breastfeeding mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Limited for the transport of orlistat GSK across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (body mass index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypokalorical, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there are not enough data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, as orlistat is only minimally resorbed, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the other components • Premature treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.5) • Diagnosis • Pregnancy (see section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight loss in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist prior to treatment with alli because the dosage of the anti-diabetic must be adjusted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or high cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these drugs has to be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy-prevention measures in order to prevent the oral contraception possible in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma level was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">When using warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the quick-values (international normalised ratio, INR) could be affected (see paragraph 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who have been treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K remain in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin uptake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the gift of an Amiodarone one-time dose, a marginal decrease in Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are associated with the pharmacological effects of the drug because the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 100), rarely known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of adverse events reported after the market launch of orlistat is unknown since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to inhibitions with regard to possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days at normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the market launch, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, a rapid recovery of possible systemic effects deriving from the lipasinhibitory properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect is based on the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by means of covalent bonding to active serine residue of gastric and pancreatic lids.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies have shown that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks the absorption of approximately 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies of adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypocritical, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was evaluated as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the Gesamtcholesterin was with orlistat 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (initial value 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (baseline 3,30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (baseline: 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At waist circumference the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60mg (initial value 103.7 cm) and placebo -3.6 cm (baseline 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could only be detected sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two major metabolites, i.e. M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after deactivation of the N-form-leucine group), were identified in a study with obese patients, representing approximately 42% of total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on conventional studies on safety macropology, toxicity in repeated doses, genotoxicity, canogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data can not identify any particular threat to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Alois is used for chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Alois can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an anti-cancer drug).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended, as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), which prevents the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three major studies, Alois studied at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong or moderate releases for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In the case of chemotherapies, the strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloha showed no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 from 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In the case of chemotherapies, the moderate releases for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloha showed no vomiting in the 24 hours following chemotherapy (153 of 189), 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 by 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloha (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a permit for the marketing of Aloha in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Alois is indicated: for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Alois for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Because palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with anamnesty obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be monitored closely after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is recommended with simultaneous offering of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the QT interval is extended or which tend to be such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Alois should not be used to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five chemotherapeutic agents studied against tumors (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady State- Concentration of oral Metoclopraids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, biturdol, ritonavir, sertraline and terbinafine) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience of the application of palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, therefore palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events observed in a dose of 250 micrograms were reported (a total of 633 patients), possibly associated with alalmaxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10.000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the destination (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experience reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-action relationships to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were performed, however, due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably no effective therapy with an Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cisplatin, Carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and 250 mg / m2 of dolometron (half-life 7,3 hours) that was given intravenously on day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine, and 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of ondansetron which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dagetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After clinical investigations, Palonosetron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG-effects of the given palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportional in the entire dose range of 0.3 90 μ / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Intravenous Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses was measured in 11 testicular carcinoma patients between day 1 and day 5 (± SD) increase in palonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that at once daily intravenous injection of 0.25 mg Palonosetron on 3 consecutive days, the total text (AUC0- ∞) was comparable to the value measured after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the Cmax was higher after the entry of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor in comparison to Palonite.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the Isoenzyme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination According to an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in urine, palonosetron as unaltered active ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous injection injection in healthy patients, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminal Elimination time and the average systemic exposure to palonosetron are increased, but this does not justify a reduction of the dose.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, effects were only observed after expositions that are considered adequate for the maximum human-therapeutic exposure, suggesting low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From preclinical studies, indications have shown that palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and extend the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dosage corresponded in about 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine Neoplasms (in thyroid gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, adrenal marrow) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Alois is determined by humans for one-time application, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution for the marketing of the drug provided for the treatment of hepatitis C.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same drug-like ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference medicinal product" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In the case of a microscopic investigation, the liver tissue damages damage, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood abnormally increase.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Alpheon's manufacturer submitted data suggesting the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference medicinal product to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment (i.e. no evidence of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA is Authorised for non business purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="2669">Moreover, concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed would not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, which responded to treatment with Alphema and Roferon-A, was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alphema, the disease flamed back to more patients than with the reference medicinal product; Alpheon also had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug responds to an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine) is not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection accompanied by crustaceans) and small infected laths (crack or incisions), abrasions and sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by methicillinic Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not have an effect against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the skin surface to be treated must not be more than 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cured at the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients with Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo arm the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin patients, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together in skin rounds, about 90% of patients in both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it has been found that Altargo is not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (stained-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that have been proven or presumably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side-effect with Altargo (which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the surface of the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the following superficial skin infections in short-term treatment: • Impetigo, • infected small laths, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the transport of Altargo across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of sensitization or serious local irritation by the use of retinol ointment the treatment should be stopped, the ointment must be carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection should begin.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retinapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as a pathogen or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">The efficacy of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in clinical studies was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after a 2-3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Because of the low plasma concentrations attained in humans after topical application on skewed skin or infected surface wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg. of ketoconazole increased the average retinapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% retinapamulin Salbe on a weakened skin of healthy adult males by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adjustment is not considered necessary if topical retapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are insufficient in relation to a statement on the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retinapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retinapamulin is preferable to a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">The decision whether breastfeeding should be continued / stopped or continued / terminated with Altargo is to weigh the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for women.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have applied altargo, the most commonly reported side effect was irritation at the site, approximately 1% of the patients concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance which is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The effect mechanism of retinapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site is involved in the ribosomal protein L3 and is located in the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Binding to this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibit the transfer of peptidyltransfer, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If the use of retina in at least some infection forms appears questionable due to the local prevalence of resistance, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences were observed in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the event of a non-response to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption in a healthy adult study, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily under occlusion on intact and scented skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">In 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before medication and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic exposure to the human after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the retinapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid gland alterations.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro examination on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma-test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rat microkernel test for in vivo investigation of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, resulting in up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2) abraded skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats were observed at oral dosing of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3-fold of estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the marketing authorisation must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in the 1.8.1 of the application form (version 6.2), is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner agrees to carry out detailed studies and additional drug vigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in the 1.8.2 module of the authorisation application, as well as all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for humane use," the updated RMP should be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated area show you to quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if it was not specifically prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment expires on one of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment you can cover the affected area with a sterile dressing or a gazebo, unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic closure that contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminum bag containing 0.5 g ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">Therefore, Ambirix should only be used if there is low risk of hepatitis B infection while immunization, and it is ensured that the vaccination plan existing from two doses can be completed.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is requested against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by contributing to the immune system (the body's natural defense), as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">"" "" "" "Ambirix" "" "contains the same components as the inoculation of the Twinrix adult approved since 1996 and the Twinrix children approved since 1997." ""</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix groups contain identical components, some of the data supporting the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the final injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study involving 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix progressed between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar to six months and a 12 month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection site, redness, fatigue (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission issued a permit to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a permit for the transport of Ambirix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardizination plan for the immunization with Ambirix consists of two doses, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster shots are desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines or combination vaccines can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-HBsAg (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-HV antibodies are in the same order as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent persons who have responded to a Hepatitis A- vaccination need a booster shots as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory even in cases of no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, adequate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, it is recommended to use a combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units with formalinininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of haemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody-level can be achieved after primary dimming, so that in these cases the gift of additional vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal success in the gluteal muscle, these injection ways should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix can be injected subcutaneously, as it may result in haemorrhages after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection with a combined diphtheria-, tetanus, azellular pertussel, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response was adequate to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it has to be assumed that no adequate immune response may be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, maturation, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever were similar to the frequency observed in the earlier thiomerage and preservative-containing vaccine formulations.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials 2029 vaccines were administered on a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a basis of calculation per vaccine, but not on a basis of calculation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix in 50.7% of subjects, compared with 39,1% in subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the test persons who had given Ambirix reported pain, compared to 63.8% in the test persons who were vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maturation was comparable per proband (i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who got Ambirix compared to 36.2% in the subjects who received the 3-doses combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of severe pain and maturation was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">The occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the AmbirixGroup was comparable to that in a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old vaccines, which was observed when using the 3-canned combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalinininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">After vaccination with Ambirix, however, there was a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines that reported severe side effects during the 2-doses vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccination scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted for vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years, serum conversions for anti-HAV were 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose administered in the month 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study carried out in 12- and including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were obtained with three doses of Ambirix and 147.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was exchangeable, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the 3 dosage vaccine was administered significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses, which were achieved within a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11-year-olds one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines either received a 2-doses vaccine with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of malinininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6-months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunoreaction observed in this study against both antigens was comparable to that which after vaccination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine, consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was detected in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial involving 12- to including 15-year-olds, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies was comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccine scheme compared to the 0-12 months vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the booster shots of a combined diphtheria-, tetanus, azellular pertussel, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response was adequate to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and serum convergence rates as for the previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after the resusension on any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2777">The hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by virus-containing foods and beverages, but can also be transmitted by other means, such as swimming in waters contaminated by water.</seg>
<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may necessitate a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series with 2 doses has been completed.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vaccines, (although your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections affecting the liver or causing symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be caused by itchy skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • if your child has already suffered an allergic reaction to a previous vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B. • If you / your child has severe infection with fever / fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the usual administration of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / her child will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccine (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second inoculation dose of this vaccine with reduced levels of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vaccination protection before the end of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is injected with people suffering from severe bleeding disturbances, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child is weak due to illness or treatment in your / his body's defences, or if you / your child undergo a hematalysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals on vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction to the vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines (including those you can get without prescription) or if you / your child have been vaccinated recently / has been given / has given / has given / or this is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is insufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given to Ambirix at the same time, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Typically, Ambirix is not administered pregnant or breastfeeding women unless it is urgently needed to be vaccinated both against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ A very common case (more than 1 case per 10 inimated doses): • Pain or discomfort on the spot or redness • Matteousness • irritability • headache • appetite deficiency</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on data known since the first approval for the transport market, CHMP has seen that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was only put into circulation in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammop can also be used in patients at the age of more than 1 month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonschnaps - divided on several single doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a gastropostomy hose (through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">There was no comparative study since Ammonschnaps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a pseudo-drug, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonary may also cause loss of appetite, abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, headache, fainting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Ammonaps in patients with disorders of the urea cycle has effectively prevented ammonia values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonschnaps was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "because due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval there was limited information about this medicine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already been manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect that manifests after the first month of life) there is an indication for use when a hyperammonia encephalopathy is present in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swallowing, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually, taking account of the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to clinical experience, regular daily dose sodium butyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight exceeding 20 kg, as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of caramylphosphate synthetase or ornithindscarbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swallowing as there is a risk for the formation of Esophagusulcera when the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium butyl rat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as clinical conditions associated with sodium retention and odema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium-phenylbutyrate via the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) it slowed the neural proliferation and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted into the breast milk in humans, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least 56% of patients showed at least one adverse event (AE) and at 78% of these unwanted events was assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and sometimes (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18 year old anorectic patient with metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactacidosis, severe hypokalemia, bullet topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred in a 5 month old infant with an inadvertent single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolise active compound, which is conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that, for each gram, monosodium glutamine can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately commenced to improve survival chances and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infested, and the disease itself led to death in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">As a result of hematalysis, the use of alternative channels of nitric acid (sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn babies at postpartum (however within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients, it came with time for many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the ornithindscarcanylase deficiency), which were recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium polybutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is enjugated in liver and kidney with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by dose of a single dose of 5 g. of sodium-phenylbutyrat in case of sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied for intravenous intravenous sodium butyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate in cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium butyrate in tablet form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected 15 minutes after taking.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In most cases, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) in the majority of patients with uric acid deficiency (300-650 mg / kg / day) was no phenylacetate in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium polybutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the average levels of phenylacetate in the plasma level were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted via the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product Phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">After the Micronucleus test results, sodium polybutyrat was not treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (investigation 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules are either taken orally (babies and children, who still cannot swallow tablets, or patients with difficulty swallowing) or via a Gastrostomieslauch or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to clinical experience, regular daily dose sodium butyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in infants, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight exceeding 20 kg, as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of caramylphosphate synthetase or ornithindscarbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium butyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat-flutes were exposed before the birth phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrat), it came to lesions in the pyramid cells of the cerebral cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18 year old anorectic patient with metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactacidosis, severe hypokalemia, bullet topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that, for each gram, monosodium glutamine can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g Phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium biphenylbutyrate in granular form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected 15 minutes after taking.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the shelf life, the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0,95 g, the medium measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication by a probe, AMMONAPS may also be dissolved in water prior to use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot secrete the nitrogenous waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out at your disposal, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS as sodium phenylbutyrat can affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you may not take AMMONAPS as the medicine can pass to breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headache, taste disturbances, negligence, destitution, memory problems and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your doctor or hospital for the purpose of an appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS, reduced blood flow to the heart), for example in instable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress" (an anomalous measured value in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients with a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of Angiox in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) was compared with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, patients often have a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery to prevent closure) and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as cximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without application of GPI - in the prevention of new events (death cases, heart attacks or revascularisation) after 30 days or a year as effective as the conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing PCI, Angiox was as effective in relation to all indicators as Heparin, except for severe bleeding, with which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against bidated rudin, other hirudine, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as in people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) came to the conclusion that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd for the transport of Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST lifting infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous dose of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is subsequently performed in the patient, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a cleation of 0.5 mg / kg should be given followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous infusion of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a direct following IV infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of any Bolus gift from Angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt load of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the incidence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before use and the bolus dose should be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value amounts to more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer necessary, provided that the 1,75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">A lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dosage should be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate renal damage, which were included in the Phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), included for approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after application of the Bivalidin-Bolus without dose adaptation at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients Angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration is finished.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• a known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component or against hirudine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a disturbance of the haemostasesystems and / or irreversible artery disorders. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients must be monitored carefully during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivalidating is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if most of the blood counts on arterial points occur in PCI patients under Bivalidated din, patients who undergo a pertory coronary intervention (PCI) can cause bleeding in principle throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and treated with bicantirudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International Regised Ratio) should be taken into consideration to ensure that the value after replacing the treatment with Bivalirudin is again reached the level before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge about the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytic or thrombocyte unit), it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bicycine with thrombocyte aggregations or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological check-up parameters can be monitored regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental investigations are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalidated alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalidating din plus GPIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractionated heparin or esnoxaparin plus GPIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalidin Group and in the comparison groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to ACUITY and Timi scales for severe bleeding like in Table 2's footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both mild and heavy bleedings occur significantly less frequently under Bivalirudin than in the groups with Heparin plus GPIb / IIIa inhibitor and Bivalidruid plus GPIb / IIIa inhibitor (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the point of the point, reduction of haemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding place, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other "point" points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat, were further, less frequently observed bleeding localisations that occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally).</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with Bivalidating in 6000 patients undergoing PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalidated Group and in the comparison groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less in Bivalirudin than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported in practice after comprehensive application and are grouped according to system organ classes in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose, the treatment with bivalirudin is immediately to be removed and the patient is closely meshed with a view to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombinder inhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic center as well as in the anionic binding region of Thrombin, regardless of whether thromboin is present in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin to Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin on his part restores the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active center of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, serum induced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) in the past did not induce thrombocytes aggregation response.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients Bivalirudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect occupied by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If one PCI is performed in the following, an additional bolus of 0.5mg / kg of bivaliddin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In arm A of the ACUITY study unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST lifting infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIb / IIIa inhibitor prior to angiography (at the time of randomisation) or with the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients, requiring angiography in 72 hours, were evenly distributed across the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKC changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients submitted within 72 hours of angiography.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and 1- yearly endpoint for the total population (ITT) and for the patients receiving aspirin and clopidogrel according to the protocol (before angiography or before the PCI) are shown in tables 7 and 8.</seg>
<seg id="2933">ACUITY study; 30-day and 1-year risk difference for the combined ischemic endpoint and its components for patients receiving aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol *</seg>
<seg id="2934">Patients who received aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol were given arm A Arm B arm C UFH / Enox Bival B- A C- A Bival + GPIa + GPIa + GPIa + GPIa Risk Diff.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The frequency of bleedings both in the ACUITY- and the timi scale up to day 30 for the total population (ITT) and for patients who received aspirin and Clopidogrel according to the protocol is shown in Table 9.</seg>
<seg id="2936">Patients who received Aspirin and Clopidogrel Total population (ITT) according to protocol received UFH / Enox Bival Bival + + alone GPIb / IIIa (N = 2924)% (N = 4603) (N = 4604) (N = 2842)%%%%</seg>
<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel before angiography or before PCI 1 A ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperito-neal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the point of the point, reduction of haemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding place, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on four triple and triple endpoints of a randomised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing PCI (REPLACE-2), are presented in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivaliddin were evaluated in patients who underwent a pertory coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">As a peptide, Bivalidating is expected to pass a catabolism into its amino acid constituents with subsequent reutilization of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary Metabolit resulting from the split of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through thromboin is not effective because of the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of thrombine.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Elimination is performed in patients with normal renal function after a process of first order with a terminal half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional studies on safety macropology, toxicity in repeated doses, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, preclinical data can not identify any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity in animals repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks at exposure to 10-cases of the clinical steady-state-plasma concentration) was limited to overshooting pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Adverse events due to long-term physiological stress in response to non-homeostatic coagulation were not observed after short-term exposure comparable to those in clinical use, even at very much higher dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2947">If the manufacturing of ready-to-use solution 17 is not under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, it cannot be stored for longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Angiox is a freeze-dried powder in single dose heats of type 1 glass to 10 ml sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and sealed with a cap made of pressed aluminum.</seg>
<seg id="2949">5 ml sterile water for injection purposes are put into a water bottle angiox and easily waved until everything has dissolved completely and the solution is clear.</seg>
<seg id="2950">5 ml of sodium chloride solution for injection or 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5mg / ml of bivalidin.</seg>
<seg id="2951">The owner of the marketing agreement agrees to carry out the studies and pharmacovigilance activities cited in the Pharmacovigilance Plan, as outlined in Version 4 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in module 1.8.2 of approval for the transport market, as well as any subsequent alterations to the RMP approved by CHMP.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes who need treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) injected into the abdominal wall, thighs or upper arm or administered as a continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin for the regulation of glucose (sugar) in the blood or cannot process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lucsin differs very slightly from the insulin analog, and the change means that it has a quicker effect and shorter mode of action than a short-acting insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between 4 and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where body insulin cannot be effectively processed, Apidra has been studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study conducted by adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed in comparison to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin-leaps.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the decrease in HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% at human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against insulin-lucsin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH approval for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be used as subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal wall, thigh or delta muscle or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the abdomen area.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose tolerance and the reduced insulin metabolism, the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the effective strength, the brand (hermetic), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production may undergo a change in insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3. inadequate dosing or abortion, especially in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change of the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">These include oral antidiabetic agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, polyamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salizylates, and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the symptoms of adrenergic antigens can be weakened or missing under the effect of likeolytics such as beta-blockers, clonidin, guanethidin and reserpine.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglucsin and the human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lucsin occurs in human breast milk, but generally insulin does not enter into breast milk, nor is it absorbed after oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the adverse drug kings known from clinical trials, grouped by system organ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (≥ 1 / 10; rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, dizziness, excessive dog, headaches, nausea, and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy will be foamed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area, resulting in lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Serious hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a correspondingly trained person or administered by a physician by intravenous injection of glucose.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After gluing, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake (in particular skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that the effect occurs faster with a subcutaneous GA- be of insulin lucsin and the amount of action is shorter than at hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mellitus, insulin lucine showed a proportional amount of glucose in the therapeutic relevant dosing range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in glucosesenic effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lucine has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves a complete glucosesenic action about 2 hours earlier than acting insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that a similar postprandiale glycaemic control is achieved in an application of insulin lysine 2 minutes before meal, as with a humanly regular insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin lucsin was dosed 2 minutes before the meal, a better postprandiale control than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal, was achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lysine is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a similar glycemic control as with a human normal insulin, which is given 2 mi- nudes before the meal (see Figure 1), is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lucsin 2 minutes before beginning of the meal compared to the normal insulin analog which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) and in comparison to a normal insulin analog which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lucsin for 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal compared to a humanoid standard insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
