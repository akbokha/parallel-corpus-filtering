&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Trans@@ lator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu under Tools Website . select the source and target language of the translation from the list . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated into place of the whole &amp; URL .
automatic translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . bab@@ el@@ fish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , the translations should not make important decisions dependent , without checking the translation before .
only web pages can be translated . other texts should be translated by yourself on the Bab@@ el@@ fish page , where you can paste texts directly .
the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions by &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier available .
more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , choose settings extensions ... Open the card tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard installation modules from the k@@ de p@@ add@@ ons package . please note that there are more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras cancel . then you can view the page that caused &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if present , delete .
the Module An@@ gle Filter ( also called Fol@@ der Fil@@ ters ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Tools View filters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Tools to view DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ Element , all other nodes are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view of objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different toolbar and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
tree @-@ Maps allow representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the child objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder defining the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . in this way , large files can be easily recognized even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy . therefore &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap listing a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles have meaningful color and cap@@ tion settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched over View color mode can either provide depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property such as name , owner , group , or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space for the representation or whether the area of sub @-@ rect@@ angles should be used . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rect@@ angle .
with Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always comp@@ lied with . boxes are drawn to represent the ne@@ sting of entries , and those boxes need space that is then no longer available to subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame if the rect@@ angle is square .
as division of the area of an entry is done for the subordin@@ ate entries , the implementation is left to the implementation . in this case , it is necessary to divide the areas in such a way that rect@@ angles are formed , which are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive split .
you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry via the menu entry View An@@ gle at Area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the picture gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras View picture gallery ... or using C@@ trl ; I .
when you access the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens which allows you to specify the image of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the Picture per line option has a sli@@ der and a rotation field to set the number of mini pictures of each line in the gallery .
with the An@@ alog field File name of the image , specify whether the fil@@ en@@ ames will be displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the check@@ box file size of the image , specify whether the file size is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the image size check box , you specify whether the image size is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the Fol@@ der dialog , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in the Save In HTML file , enter where the HTML page is to be saved .
with the Sub@@ folders check box , you can set up with a sli@@ der or rotation field , up to which level the sub@@ folders are included .
use the check box to copy original pictures to see if the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery .
using the check box comment file , you can specify a comment file for cap@@ tion of images in the gallery .
you can specify a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings provides you with easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behaviour of the web browser can be specified here :

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be provided to you to connect to your digital camera and your photos directly to &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums can download . of course , each medium and card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; work together .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . editing capabilities can easily be expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( Manual ) modules .
although digi@@ ti@@ sed ; easy to use , there are dozens of professional capabilities available . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via camera or lens to search for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . you should therefore report problems and opportunities for improvement .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to report problems or suggestions for improvement as easily as possible . wherever you are in the program , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . i.e. , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to ask you to answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ code ; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to participate in &amp; edited ; registration is in the developer mailing list . instructions for registering in the Develop@@ er mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
once you start editing , you will be prompted where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote , or removable folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data collection is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; Edit ; will also use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek in addition .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder . &amp; Edit ; considers each sub@@ folder as an album .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; needs recur@@ sively recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you cannot exclude sub@@ folders unless it i@@ ste in hidden folder . this allows you to insert special files by inser@@ ting a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ ites do not have any pictures as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and putting it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; edit your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Cue List to manage your photos in the albums .
support is based on the li@@ bra@@ id library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help raw amer@@ a@@ support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h decoder settings and raw workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be provided to you to connect to your digital camera and your photos directly to &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums can download . of course , each medium and card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash , memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are big files and transfers via the serial port are slow , this connection is now dep@@ rec@@ ated . &amp; Edit ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that digi@@ cam images can be read reliably . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the nic@@ est things in &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; Edit ; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in &amp; dialog ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; or switch to full screen mode using F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop images all over : you can place an image in a different part of the Al@@ ben@@ edi@@ el , above the horizontal dividing line or in another application window . the only limitation is that one image cannot be stored in keywords , date lists or searches .
- a file type selection allows you to save the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , raw , movies and audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . so , the filter on the file name works only if this filter is also displayed in the symbol view . which fields are shown can be configured in the dialog of the alert settings .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ sis &amp; quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all the photos that were saved by &amp; digi@@ kam , are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were created on the hard drive , according to the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created . the date can be changed in the features of the album .
if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album Import images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse onto the target album and drop it down . in the then appearing menu you have to choose whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move it to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to give information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select album Properties from the context menu .
album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos if you want to add or delete albums by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections .
the album date : will be used if you sort your albums by date with View records sorted by date .
the buttons El@@ ders , average , New Year : these put the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or that of the average of the album . to do this , the average of the pictures will first try to calculate the EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder instead .
when you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; open , the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ i ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview , choose . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be dis@@ car@@ ded .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the input of keywords for single photos in the area My Key@@ word list on the bottom left of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album will be displayed in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait for a moment while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by using the Tools menu on the Tools menu .
information about each image will be displayed below the preview . what information this is , you can change your profile via Settings . select the albums page and adjust the thumb@@ nail area to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you leave the mouse cursor one moment over a picture , the help displays the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such a help window .
photo editing displays your photos and allows you to organize a number of improvements to these . you can reach all the functions that have been edited with &amp; Edit ; you can reach all the functions that have been edited with &amp; Edit ; you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or editing the pictures .
you can open the image processing with a photo using either F@@ 4 image editing ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit ... editing . in the Edit section , you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos . image editing allows you to view and edit your photos .
you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the opening menu . for this , and how to customize it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs , there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image . this way , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc .
&amp; Edit ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the thumb@@ nail to preview and rotate . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a Photo from &amp; Edit , it is moved to the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Photo Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift + Del .
the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ der quot ; organizes your photos based on the data . &amp; Edit ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days .
photos with keyword provide a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos and catalo@@ gu@@ ise . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo may be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
when a keyword is selected , all photos selected with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted into a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also collapse parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My Key@@ word Networks , so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . you can also use your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; or on an existing keyword and then select new keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this will become the sub@@ stit@@ uting of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by dra@@ gging it to the desired position in the tree and storing it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and editing the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My Cue .
to select another photo as an album icon , select the picture with the right mouse button and select as Album preview in the context menu . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can happen in two ways : once you have chosen the photos you want to provide with a keyword , you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My cus@@ p . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be shown as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way you can give a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event in which it was made etc .
once you have provided a picture with keywords , this will be shown under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Remove from the Tags menu . the menu only shows you the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ dependent adjusted hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . in order to select a time@@ frame , you only need to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the frame , which indicates the time unit . this will show all associated images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will then appear in the list below .
include all the elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more in the future .
inci@@ dentally , the search box is a small lamp that will be green if the search finds matches . if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all images will be displayed again . if The Search has not found anything , then the lamp will be red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tabs on the left side bar with bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here but as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be performed . the results will be used in the View My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu .
when you select Edit Search , the search query form will appear again with the previously entered search information . if you select Edit As an advanced search , the Advanced search dialog will appear to change your previous search . see section The Advanced search tool for more information .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Search in the context menu .
the Advanced search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in specific fields by &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . any option can be added to this list with search group / search group or deleted from it . any option can be associated with others about the logical operations All ... , A ... , No ... or at least ... . in addition , you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; characterized each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond to it . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar items : this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar . by means of a Sw@@ ell@@ ert , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sket@@ ch : free hand color sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and digi@@ plug ; find the matching pictures . also here a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . move it in or out with the mouse wheel or move it down and move it . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this assumes , of course , that your images contain Ge@@ o data .
you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter in the field below . it will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder .
&amp; Edit ; provides a lamp in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl + L . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opens . if you are back in &amp; edited ; main window , you can quickly open the lumin@@ aire with L Extras .
from the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you navigate p@@ airing from the toolbar , then the two first images will automatically be loaded into the compartments . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to see it on the left . this simplifies working through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal delete actions also work directly from the light table , e.g. F@@ 4 file Edit ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom end of each area you will find a built @-@ in pi@@ v@@ ot function , which you can recognize on the crossed arrows . in order to pi@@ v@@ ot the visible range of the image , you need to click on it and the &amp; L@@ MB ; keep it pressed . in the preview mode both images will display the same image area .
the zoom works just like in other views . just use the zoom sli@@ der under the images or c@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out .
digital stock management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or stores digital photos leads a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up your images , find , protect and use photos again . we focus on the procedures for digital photographers that &amp; digi@@ kam ; use . we view the download , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , classi@@ fy , archive , optimize , maintain and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management adop@@ ts , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , seeks , transforms , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is based on your definition data that provide information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you don &apos;t need to find a specific photo longer without inventory management . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have then you certainly don &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to save the metadata in both a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you must decide whether other access to your photos should have , whether you want to save it to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a larger disk at some point .
you may be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found about your location unless you were in the same place several times in one year . if you have enough photos , then you will be able to use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; export is then a folder for images that you can print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , workflow , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? separation of file types makes pile handling easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know whether you are looking for an original or derived image .
we also recommend storing the metadata option in the Edit page in &amp; dialog ; enabling EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data to be written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which edited ? add a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are , of course , the most important ones .
now the real work starts , as you should assign each photo to keywords , in@@ scrip@@ tions and a rating . of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . you start the best with the rating or ranking . this makes sense , as you can focus on the best photos during further work .
now let &apos;s talk with keywords , keywords , as you frequently are called in other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically set the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . the change of hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can be easily done by moving a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are done by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated while it tracks the sub@@ trees .
the graphic shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation because each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you just want to let no one see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies .
from the distance is not even a nice panorama of the beach . if you look at it closer , then start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dre@@ aming to have associations , memories , the historical time period is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others who look at your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you want to show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer , to help him understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as a let@@ tering . if you export your images in web galleries , then these labels will be exported according to your wishes in the cap@@ tion and / or the title of the web gallery system .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet off Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? good , because with pictures the move of the spatial presentation now drives with speed of light .
the possibilities to exploit ge@@ olo@@ cation are already inn@@ um@@ erable and will become even deeper in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually recre@@ ate your trips using images with geographic information . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a pu@@ n with copyright and describes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam , which should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , then the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author ) : linked to the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s job description . examples of this can be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture here .
the solution to this problem is digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . digi@@ ti@@ sed ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
topics : disk failure , disk failure , electrical sur@@ ges , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , dis@@ semin@@ ated super@@ sti@@ tions
of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire . these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper or neg@@ atives . in this section we discuss problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery firm , has some interesting statistics , which causes a loss of data .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , they need to be handled carefully and you can &apos;t afford more than a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive .
CD / DVD disks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and storing them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest ones , but you write a lot more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if you have just been written . therefore , they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there &apos;s a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that seems to work miracles on CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from corrupted disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a Dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs , of course , also applies to Blu @-@ ray disc .
then read the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store on a clean , dark dry and protected spot . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves . their manufacturers &apos; warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this subject : disk study
the failure rate is dramatic . electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT can not detect these errors . some errors identified by S@@ MA@@ RT her@@ ald the im@@ min@@ ent failure . these are especially read errors and publishing counter@@ s . the expected life time is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also have data loss due to a current loss before you have backed up the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
while most electrical devices don &apos;t matter much , it looks different with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause severe damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause scrat@@ ched key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs some of the energy j@@ okes and gro@@ oves the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should be aware that it fulfil@@ s the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care that it provides protection against flash impact and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage cont@@ actors , which also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem so that you are ideal for on the go .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in an un@@ interrupted power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically re@@ charge battery power when a power failure occurs . this gives you the ability to store your data and run down the system . if you purchase a UPS , you should be sure that they fulfill the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in case of electricity trouble with the cost to avoid this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . finally , you should always remember to tr@@ ash all the cables before you go on holiday .
the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shared Storage is another popular offer to store any amount of data .
you are compared to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services rendered on photos . your free storage is limited to 1@@ GB and you will not have your pictures available in full resolution online . for $ 25 a year you get unlimited storage , which should be checked in reality first .
from the viewpoint of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and in the big companies is included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ certainty .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive .
the worst thing about it is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not if it happened in your hardware . all these disturbances stay und@@ et@@ ected until one day you have to open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have ever thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . you will see thousands of errors a year already in 2010 .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can deal with disk failures on a lower level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ low@@ fs file system . this is still in the alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss on the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the work@@ station systems . in case of lap@@ tops , the share of th@@ ef@@ ts amounts to 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage , e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ F@@ s and X@@ FS to name the most popular file systems . find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been stored completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft , and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings removed from fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while technology continues to develop , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ apixel numbers . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deterior@@ ates . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ apixel and high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t blame anybody for data loss . so , secure your data often after a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous like re @-@ installing your operating system , replacing plates or res@@ izing the size of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive daily . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft deficit : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs to the neighbour house , into your office or something similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as said above , there is a common cause for data loss , despite safegu@@ arding the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot of two times : the complete backup and the last differential protection .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original state at any time on which such a backup has been made . this backup comes from a version@@ ing system the next with the exception that is only sam@@ pled and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium .
this procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should happen manually after which you have made a complete review .
themes : metadata , IP@@ TC stored in the image file , retain original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eval of images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , using the internet .
in order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you need to look at everything today with caution and re @-@ rate as time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way to make a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . the fewer variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the print@@ out for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned scal@@ ability and have placed the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this section and shift it onto a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk was detected by the system , but do not hang it .
/ dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ db / dev / s@@ db , res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of stimulus if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market , so you shouldn &apos;t use it anymore .
PNG is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG can store g@@ amma and chrom@@ ati@@ city data for improved color allocation on hetero@@ geneous platforms . the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF needed and a slow compression . we would recommend this format to save your images .
TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . a problem is , however , that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a ro@@ yalty @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and oblig@@ ated to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers already provide D@@ NG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it at some point .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource blo@@ gger ; technology of the 90@@ s . it is a labelling technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file themselves . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers drag it before an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , to archive . X@@ MP fits in because it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it may cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file . therefore , you should consider if you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include the work on architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI teams , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a broad acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera screen , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them to your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for fine @-@ layer editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; Edit , then you should add the metadata again . these may be cut off from the other programs .
protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only then in web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; edited ; to get a description on how to add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ Database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , connect them to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol will be displayed on the camera for each file , photos , movies , music , etc .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the Metad@@ ata section displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as the editor &apos;s main window , or editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of All . this loads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . when downloading , the photos will not be deleted and we recommend that you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can select only the desired selection methods by &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then download the selected one . the selected download button will be gra@@ yed until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these images have not been downloaded yet by &amp; digi@@ kam . in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
if you are using the All Download or Sel@@ ected buttons , a dialog with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are placed . the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums tab . then select the target album from the list and click OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; Edit ; load the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by using the Del@@ ete All Del@@ ete button . if you want to delete only some , you must select it first and then delete the deleted ones .
please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded into a digi@@ plug ; album downloaded before you want to delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera finder , you should do this via the camera menu , as this is much faster .
the file names are usually re@@ used after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can lead to double fil@@ en@@ ames in case you upload photos from different recording galleries into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to include the date and time when the image was taken into the file name .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created per day .
the first two concern the data about the author in section Standard Car Identi@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , for example , in the editing area , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S .
if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case if you prefer this .
the new file name , which is edited and edited ; for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera will provide in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used when you next time you open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation while downloading . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar metadata you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is usually turned on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , it is digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photo in its original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced Button and select the Automatic rotation in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken , you can use it to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are downloaded in the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a @-@ data you can find out what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and digi@@ ti@@ sed in this case ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn on this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the button Download . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is finished , asks &amp; Edit ; you where the images should be uploaded . select a folder selection dialog for the camera . select here the desired folder and click OK to start the upload . images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude gra@@ ding and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be done by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environment planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can with a click open a browser that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ code ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 has many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ings and map references . the question is actually more , how the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical allocation ( manual ) and last on manual input of known locations .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work together with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you have to save this data in g@@ p@@ x format , since this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ mapping module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate data from images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same on &amp; Linux ; go to g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ l@@ eness or other data , you can use this script that works with the ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phi@@ l Harv@@ ey . it uses the predefined coordinates , which are created for example by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European sites , at least French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; try to give you so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that have changed the behavior of &amp; Edit . to access these settings , you must select Edit Settings ; set up the settings dialog . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left .
select Action can be set to preview or start image editing . so you set the default behavior of &amp; Edit ; specify when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface .
this field should include the photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the car field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for vendors : use this field to indicate who is offering the photo . this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations should be listed here , then the group or agency that provides the image will be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this means that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the digi@@ code database ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited in &amp; edited ; without getting lost .
save image in@@ scrip@@ tions as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images .
the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter rests in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; edited ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
you can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ aire by &amp; digi@@ plug ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , each time you open the illuminated table these settings are switched on . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size , you should only use on fast machines . if you have one , then you can get better viewing results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark@@ er or bright color in the image . these colors are set here . in the image processing , this picture mode with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 can be switched on and off .
with chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation .
with the PNG compression option you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality , as PNG requires a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
using the TIFF Com@@ pression option , you can comp@@ ress the default compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no influence on image quality , since the default algorithm works without loss .
with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning .
in earlier versions of &amp; edited , image editing was only an image viewer for photos . currently , it quickly develops into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing .
the standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor respond more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in odd lines , this difference creates a lat@@ tice pattern in the output . this option draws the image a bit soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 lat@@ tice patterns with the V@@ NG@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the Automatic Color Balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . default is to use a solid color balance , based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the standard is the top lights , so the parts of your images that are burned , due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights , as passing white . finally , you can attempt to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels in general do not satur@@ ate as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the option to Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ ause , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . to keep the time for the demo @-@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a demo @-@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the sub @-@ raw data that comes from the color filtered image sensor , which has many cameras and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests , it looks as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for adaptive homogen@@ eity Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for correction correction since it is carried out during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions on how to return it . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; Cont@@ acts ; information such as the color information from a color space to the other can be translated to make the colors as accurate as possible .
behavior Questions when an image is opened in image editing / Color management module with raw files start .
color Profile folder Sets the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC in which you all save your profiles . &amp; Edit ; then examine this folder during startup .
settings of ICC profiles You have the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; to store your profiles . everything can be changed later when opening the raw file .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your images color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera creator and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some such as Canon , which do not contain color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma does not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth .
there are more options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate as your image would be given back from a device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated , rather than rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for what it is intended for . unfortunately , not on the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is , of course , un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension makes the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscape , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewers and image processing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules support which have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these will be uploaded by &amp; Edit ; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and additionally you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Sh@@ ort@@ cuts .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes switch off the metadata that appears at the bottom of the images during the display .
the camera features show on the left side a list of all supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . below you find the port settings . currently there are serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage supported .
at the bottom , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field will only be active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , set it in the display mode and turn on .
if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the C@@ ameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the tr@@ ash can display the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you can find further details in the sections del@@ eting a photos and del@@ eting an album .
the edi@@ table changes through the right side@@ bar can be used in silence by &amp; Edit ; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to save the changes using the button Chan@@ ges .
you can also include the display of the welcome screen by &amp; digi@@ kam ; when starting , this speeds up the starting process by &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
the setting To search for new photos comp@@ els &amp; digi@@ kam ; Edit the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time by &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you know if it should delete them from the database .
different color schemes can be in &amp; edited ; used to customize the main window to suit your taste . these settings can be selected from the toolbar Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; edited ; to create , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; Edit ; includes fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selecting the item Display / Edit .
image editing includes a set of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; dialog ; therefore , you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see Set@@ ting up the image processing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fication factor , and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top , including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed features .
editing functions of image editing change your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
you might need to make a copy of your image before you change it . you can do this with File Save as .
as long as you haven &apos;t saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rec@@ over menu from the File menu or using the Rest@@ ore button to restore image processing in the toolbar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last saving .
virtually every action of image editing can be und@@ one or restored . you can und@@ o the last action by modi@@ fying or re@@ building edit by selecting restore from the menu .
if you use this frequently , use the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to und@@ o and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to re@@ connect .
if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; press a moment longer through the rever@@ t or restore button in the toolbar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started the editing process , you can move between the photos on the same album or keyword by clicking the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , image , or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save it .
you can zoom in and out in the picture using C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select the magni@@ fication factor
view Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you get to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want to do so , you can also edit this in the folder dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam ; Edit main window . see the section for setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or entire sentences . whole picture pages can be printed from your selection . you just have to select the images with the standard methods and select Export Controls from the menu Album . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice .
the digi@@ port ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right , providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation arrows , even in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five tabs is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge again .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented , use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
in addition to the user button , there is a button Learn more . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and coll@@ ations . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select this and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field of Re@@ gency . the code will follow the scheme in the following table :
the keyword review displays a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree , and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this digi@@ ti@@ sed session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is a further relief when entering keywords during a series of images . if you have entered different keywords , these will be saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the corresponding check boxes in the tree . keyword keyword contains all keywords for an image .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , If you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please refer to the Key@@ word filter section .
the side@@ bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar with their album , - date , keyword and search views are used . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and drop keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword .
in the above example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is based on No Key@@ words , which reduces the amount to three images , and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be disabled under Settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or it , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
you can , for example , set an advanced search on all the elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group@@ ing button . the options will then look like this :

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I did it chi@@ ef@@ ly on &amp; edited ; s concrete implementation adjusted .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is the colors that come from your camera or scanner to have a predictable deviation from the actually photograph@@ ed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web to those of your digital dark@@ room .
when the topic comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons they need to press for the results they want . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should make informed decisions on each point of image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you can obtain the desired result .
if your picture workflow satis@@ fies all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB color space . ( see below for more information )
your only other image editions are via e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and thus have to worry about dy@@ es ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB working spaces .
do I need to sound my monitor if I chose to work only in s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you must sound your monitor , since s@@ RGB is based on s@@ RGB . if you work as the colour space of s@@ RGB , you either need to calibr@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , adjust , automatic balance and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correction try automatically out of your colors the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the luminous intensity over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test spot as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out .
balance : this method adju@@ sts the intensity channel of the color of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . sometimes the compar@@ ision has very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation , which causes either wonders in an image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic comparison : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and light bor@@ der@@ tone colours and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram region .
extending contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible range and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in the case of well @-@ balanced images and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white balance by &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is somewhat limited because it works over a color space with 8 bits per color . if you can carry out the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction are better avoided .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target picture . the preview will dynamically adjust the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original white balance , then it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photo has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right above a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called l@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your results depends on shade , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shade adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play with the above controls , use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result displayed in white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Load buttons make exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and rel@@ o@@ aded later .
the default settings reset all filter values to their default values and neutral white balance . remember that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth for each color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . however , this coding needs more disk space , calculation time and is only available for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assign@@ ing color profiles . color mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to rate the chapter color management .
another important tool is to find tone correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time , so that you can always use it for several photos . this is useful if your camera or scanner always makes the same mistake and therefore always need the same correction . in the manual for sound correction you will find more information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure issues is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the digi@@ plug ; tool color effects provide you with four color effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation was also called sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that arose when a partially developed pressure replaced a short flash and then inver@@ ted the development of the image . the result was a partial ne@@ gation of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely .
the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment finally creates a negative image that is not to be generated on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar efficiency . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ a@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ire ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der re@@ ps the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large pictures , the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual to correct color contrast and brightness of the photo . you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the opposite problem : a too large satur@@ ation . even in this case , the brightness / satur@@ ation tool is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tools Gra@@ dation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool tone correction is located to improve exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of sli@@ ders for the application explained here . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel , or the selected range . under the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left hand represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the controller and take care of how the picture changes .
on the right @-@ hand side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynamically , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented by a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , medium and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to inter@@ actively change output values as in the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and store : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and rel@@ o@@ aded later . to do so , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect displayed only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result .
below is an example of adjusting input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modi@@ fying channel : this box allows to specify the channel to be changed from the module :
next to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is mostly the most meaningful . in this case , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case log@@ arith@@ mic mode continues .
for example , if you move a curve to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with dark@@ er output tones and that the associated pixels will dark@@ er .
on the preview of the original photo is a red marker to see . if you want to shift this selection to the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and store : with these buttons you can do exactly that . each curve you &apos;ve created can be stored in the file system and later loaded . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
when using this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , mid@@ - and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if detected in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect displayed only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shade and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the digi@@ plug ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint on how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and impact . the left part of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed as a comparison of your own tab .
the preview of the target picture has a red marker . if you position it in the image a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : control for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the overall brightness as well , since the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from far@@ rowing . color @-@ bro@@ w consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not occur at the same location in the color channel and their noise patterns in each channel look different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me conversion by reducing the color bre@@ wing first .
the Save as and Load buttons are used precisely for this purpose . you can save and load any arbitrary mixer setting for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect displayed only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original picture is shown below ( 1 ) and the edited picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can easily be converted to the calcul@@ ator . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks great , with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . thus similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film imaging with orange lens filters . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate the moon light scenes at the time of the day . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : creates warm and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold to the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of ble@@ aching a pressure and re @-@ development in a S@@ epi@@ at@@ onic . this is typical of the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 c@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ pent@@ ine .
with the digi@@ plug ; tool texture apply you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , stit@@ ch an old master , a Pop Art Portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : shifting this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tual effect has been applied in the picture below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to be seen . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the digi@@ plug ; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter you insert the desired frame type for your image . thoroughly re@@ vil@@ ed the image with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce trans@@ forms it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target picture decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool After aspect ratio .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture at any place . this also goes to several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter the text and place it with the mouse . the larger the image , the bigger the character set has to be . finally , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click on the &quot; OK &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the digi@@ plug ; use tool template you can put a template over a picture .
the Picture Tem@@ plate menu in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template there are no limitations concerning size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to minimize the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to &amp; digi@@ kam , you simply send an email in English to the digi@@ plug ; mailing list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button root folder in the dialog . select the folder where you have copied the template files .
after the root folder has been set for the templates a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . selecting a folder will automatically update the template &apos;s thumb@@ nail .
under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button increases the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
down@@ size : this button reduces the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole image , you must res@@ ize the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the picture lying under the template . take the picture and place it on the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but produces gran@@ ular images especially in dark areas .
blur@@ red mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually it sharp@@ ens no bit , it works rather psycho@@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric dun@@ st and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment .
images without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is due to the fact that the digi@@ tization process is composed of only minimal differences to one color point . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras typically require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
for JPEG images , a camera often has an internal sharp@@ ness . images in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers apply a depth of field even while reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . this allows you to use the menu entry Con@@ duc@@ ting Do@@ or .
you should be careful with this , because the results don &apos;t work very naturally : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen an image re@@ focus the tool . you can re@@ focus more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the image a bit sof@@ tly is much easier than sharpen@@ ing it . use the tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry Con@@ duc@@ ting sof@@ tness and experiment with some settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often generate good results and should first be tried . an increase in radius or amount strengthens the effect . if you make the blur@@ ring mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ats are created near sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should sharp@@ ens pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount to be applied . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference in order for an edge of the filters to be applied . thus areas with a soft exchange between the sounds are excluded from the shar@@ per and therefore beauty errors in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined image the ( 2 ) . blur@@ red massage was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the digi@@ plug ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focus a picture by enhancing the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted ab@@ f@@ alt@@ ation filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Filter . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ ring mask . re@@ focus usually achieves better results than blur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image processing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s cle@@ av@@ age . the auss &apos; sche cle@@ av@@ age has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ les , which are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Vienna In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels .
circular hot@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should yield 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . use@@ able values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise Filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce arti@@ facts . however , values above 0.1 are only rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very poor .
this is the radius for the sharp@@ ness of the gauge . in most cases , you should leave this parameter to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
die Size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s edge . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focuss@@ ed parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all trimm@@ ing , color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not immediately visible , but they leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts later .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; than JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by using the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically , un@@ sharp mas@@ king must always produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of sharp@@ ness . for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practically , the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ red mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focuss@@ ed image :
this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focuss@@ ed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the field of sharp@@ ness in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the smo@@ othing tro@@ wel offset the blur@@ ring of the range of the dimm@@ ed area to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink tin@@ ts allow a customized colour for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust it here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ ert Algorith@@ m was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre @-@ settings as starting points to simplify the restoration process . the available pre @-@ settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
detail Rep@@ ell@@ ation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to an even smo@@ othing over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should get details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards . please note that the detail@@ ing should always be subordin@@ ated to the directional dependence .
directional dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value is smooth@@ ed close to 1 only in one direction . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all . p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more will be smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ mo@@ b effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . usually , 1 or 2 suff@@ ices .
angle incre@@ ment da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is chosen small , it should also be chosen small . make sure that small angles generate a long run time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never larger than 2 .
using linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get by selecting this option is minimal , but it doubles the duration . we therefore recommend it to om@@ it it .
the Save as and Load buttons make exactly this . any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and re@@ charged later .
correc@@ ting errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take very long and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button .
the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a strange black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that was caused by a poor movie bearing during the trip . the original picture is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts such as dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on digital cameras from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise which can be removed successfully with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases only the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced Settings can stay with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can wipe the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus smaller bugs fixed .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness of the field . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing that the filter looks forward to detect lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or gre@@ asing occurs again .
edges : checks edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the whole noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak ru@@ stling or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we advise you to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process which is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we advise you to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma @-@ tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas which are typically stronger smo@@ k@@ ed@@ . however , it also lubric@@ ates the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of phase j@@ itter . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other . if it is raised , noise and phase j@@ itter appear at the edges .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) .
sometimes a picture is too cra@@ p for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the image a bit sof@@ tly is fortunately much easier than shar@@ pen an image . use the tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry Con@@ duc@@ ting sof@@ tness and experiment with the smo@@ othing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this restoration provides you with the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well suited for removing Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scratches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized pictures . the smo@@ othing takes place along the image contours and thereby preserves the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture replacement . the texture statement is performed with another tool , image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
reduce JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save as and Load buttons make exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and re@@ charged later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take very long and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button termin@@ ating .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gran@@ ulation on the faces . the original picture is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photo that was scanned with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts caused by scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot@@ pixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem , eight . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project protected by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ screen sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file in the wizard with the dark@@ image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark picture directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD Def@@ ects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark picture to the image to be adjusted . automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the Wizard notices the last dark and re@@ charges it automatically in the next session .
the image area and the preview help you to correct the result inside the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to see the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
average : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are moved to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are approached to compu@@ te a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are moved to compu@@ te a bi @-@ dim surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixel in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ tization ; vi@@ gn@@ etting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not uni@@ form@@ ly illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ h@@ ote ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . telep@@ hot@@ o lenses may also show this behavior .
but it also has draw@@ backs . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which makes it impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , as there are otherwise blur@@ ring effects caused by movement .
with the large exposure area of today &apos;s felt and color gra@@ ding depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a rough image without this filter . the tool vi@@ gn@@ etting correction applies the transformation with a center filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target picture .
density : this parameter controls the degree of loss of light at the point of greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which compens@@ ates an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it to compensate for a small degree .
brightness , Con@@ trast , and G@@ amma Settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the regulator only provides positive values , since you only have to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the digi@@ plug ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of vi@@ gn@@ etting correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a correction and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the digi@@ plug ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x shape of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of the fourth gra@@ ding adju@@ sts the remote corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be almost eliminated .
in general : this value controls the distortion of the second degree . with negative values , ton@@ ed distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distortion of the fourth degree . this value acts more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image . for most l@@ enti@@ ls the &apos; corners &apos; parameter has the inver@@ ted character of the parameter General .
zoom : this value res@@ umes the image size and causes a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
ligh@@ ten : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box shows the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values for the next start .
the pitch or p@@ inc@@ ision correction should be performed before any cutting or size changes . best result in this correction as the first one . if you cut a picture anew and then perform a ton @-@ shaped correction , the effect would obviously be the wrong one .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal guide line . move it to an important location , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the tone / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cro@@ pping tool in the Trans@@ forming C@@ utting menu or the Zoom controller of this dialog .
for most pictures , the tone @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some motifs such as shots from the front , frames and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the ton @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown in ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simulate Infr@@ ared film of the G@@ enn@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web page that is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left of the window you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters of film gran@@ ulation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option Add movie gran@@ ulation if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO knob changes the amount of the film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mixes colour channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights .
this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emul@@ sion .
the viewing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular view especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , adjusted to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the zoom effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity matches ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and style life are good for this effect .
the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for large images .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the edit is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel large picture is 1 and smo@@ othing 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter carbon drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage roll . the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sket@@ ch you . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two controllers with one value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pen size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smo@@ othing ) .
this is an example of the carbon @-@ marking filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the digi@@ plug ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures back with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , equal to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave block 1 : divi@@ des the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button termin@@ ating .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a central point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radial blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels around a focal point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to come back into the background .
motion blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : taken from a car or train , camera .
sof@@ tening blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and glossy soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by chance shifting of the pixels and simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent blur@@ ring : finds the ink p@@ add@@ ling in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . so you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button termin@@ ating .
rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this gives natural your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of drops on the image .
you can keep with the digi@@ plug ; image processing an area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should stay free . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can put it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or rotating . the tools can be found in the Trans@@ forming / Transformation menu .
photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good work here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool to change size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality , then try the tool to blow up .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; Edit ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ated was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and will be listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be maintained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more will be smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ mo@@ b effect it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any st@@ utter@@ ing for photo magni@@ fication can be saved as a text file and later re@@ charged .
blowing photo is very fast with what it does , but it can take very long and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button termin@@ ating .
you can see below for example for photo blowing by magni@@ fying a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . the image processing allows you to create a picture with the mouse just the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and moving the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging at the corners of the rect@@ angle . create a new rect@@ angle by simply pressing the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with cutting , use the button The trimm@@ ing button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut to size ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the Save file or Save file in the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo .
in the preview pane , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by dra@@ gging the corners with the mouse , maintaining the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog .
in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the larger value is always assigned to the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width .
this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ res , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically .
below in the dialog you can place with the Max . relationship button the area for cutting on the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool according to aspect ratio will save its settings depending on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings will be displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cro@@ pped image and not the original image .
the settings of the co@@ aster help make it easier to fade in , so that you can put your pictures together better . these help files are :
harmonious tri@@ angles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . as the third @-@ third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into similarly harmonious tri@@ angles on the diagonal .
golden center : the golden middle is a division that affects various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden split is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used to construct your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your images , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden centre .
the golden center provides smo@@ other auxiliary lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal to achieve good results for your photos . in comparison to the third angel , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this kind of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
a further rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . these rect@@ angles are used to create the golden spiral . it should give something that the eye is in the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles also derive from the golden spiral above discussed above . its verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . diagonal to these lines can be published a static object dynam@@ ical .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect created by professional photographers dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the horizontal mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the guides . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
if you make a photo , it happens easily that you do not hold the camera exactly vertical or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated by an angle . you can fix this with the digi@@ plug ; image processing and the tool free rotation .
rotate your image with the slide angle . the values on this sli@@ der are given in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can set the sli@@ der to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have turned an image you will find undesi@@ red tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function Trans@@ forming C@@ utting out of the image processing .
an elegant way to trim the image is the automatic cro@@ pping function . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smo@@ othing the image a bit after turning . note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival trans@@ formations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the top left : indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper right @-@ hand corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right @-@ hand corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is a little lubric@@ ated . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double so powerful effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transforming cro@@ pping out of the image processing .
the sh@@ earing tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part to the left . this is not rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
shoot your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , like the sea , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sh@@ earing tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ earing , the image is blur@@ red a bit . for a single sh@@ earing this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two s@@ ations produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ earing the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to remove them is to cut the image with transforming cro@@ pping out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; Edit .
because of this dependen@@ cy of other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all the file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them .
digi@@ kam ; shows only files in formats that knows . this is done by means of the file extension and a comparison of them with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , it is edited ; edit the file in the image processing ; you can change this list of file extensions , and edit . in the Configuration section , you will find more information about this .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select even the format you want to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia . &amp; Edit ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images . in doing so , redundant information is reduced to store the image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful tut@@ orials in English . you can convert raw format pictures to JPEG or TIFF with the image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam ; all supported cameras can be seen at the bottom of the website of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that by &amp; digi@@ kam ; supported :
digi@@ kam ; is not a movie editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in options to display or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; edited ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback of movies use to launch the program for playback .
go forward to the previously visited album in the chron@@ ic@@ le . you can only go forward if you &apos;ve gone back .

if you change steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well when the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustment with the white balance module .
many tools you need for editing are in &amp; edited ; your description will follow here .
all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ as , noise suppression , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp mask , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
divide vertically without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left part shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview pane .
divide horizontal without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper part shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview pane .
the left part shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
divide horizontal . the upper part shows the original and the lower one for comparison the effect of the filter .
&apos; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview pane and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on in order to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog is immediately updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the ability to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar Properties shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . move it in or out with the mouse wheel or move it down and move it . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this assumes , of course , that your images contain Ge@@ o data .
color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pallets stored by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either to the entire system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; Settings and hot Custom color and Rec@@ ently used colors .
in the pallet load dialog , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files .
the cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described below the pallet view . here , the color name can also be changed .
to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse over the left mouse button .
the color is either inserted or over@@ rides a different ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write has been selected . depending on whether the mode over@@ write has been selected . you can set this mode by selecting the check box over@@ write under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy , Cut and Pa@@ ste .
color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ ending character , if another color follows . so if three numbers are in the clip@@ board , they can be past@@ ed as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit .
the colors in the palette and the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left .
graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs which &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z include are ob@@ sol@@ ete &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ Gra@@ phs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; an . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ates ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; re@@ compu@@ te the graph and represents in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; k@@ ate ; open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphical ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems with about 1000 nodes and a h@@ ack to represent more than these nodes )
other needed software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for representing the graphs . needed are :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; without starting a argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list Rec@@ ently opened files . click the first icon to open the File dialog .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or let this position be selected automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
the zoom is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum size reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; can also remember your decision so that later it will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item Settings k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; set up ... , see also .
if you open a graph file outside of an ongoing &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; or eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; or to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
when you start the program , you can open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as change it later .
you can also specify how the graph will be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely selected .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come on one side will be placed on this page . the aspect ratio will be ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled in from the parts of the graph .
page preview with a graph displayed on several pages without header and with another font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut Lo@@ ading site gives the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been changed on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or let the program ask for each time .
you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or specify that every time it is requested .
the session management page gives you the ability to specify the startup behavior of &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not ) the files of the last session or decide to be asked for each start .
the context menu , which normally appears in a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up additional options :
here you can select among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
the algorithm defines the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edges of edges as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for non@@ er@@ ect graphs . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ board model . the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ board model for non@@ eri@@ ed graphs . it uses the Fru@@ tigen @-@ pure gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the nodes in a circle shape according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then run by a shell . the command should accept the graph file as a parameter , and display the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can specify &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithm , or change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the specific type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for non @-@ eri@@ ed graphs ) .
if this setting is checked , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
shows what is the mouse poin@@ ter . click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get further help to this element ( if available ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module includes tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner that is supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu entry Images , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . choose the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default values duc@@ r@@ oth to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you start scanning the image . the estimated file size is displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize images in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and l@@ atitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ relative . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and enter the menu . the above dialog will then appear . to find a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file using a GP@@ X file . this file contains , of course , data taken at the same locations at the same locations as the images of your camera .
when the file is loaded an automatic correlation between the coordinates in red indicates . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera is converted to GMT . this can be done with the GMT time zone . this can be done with the time zone .
the setting for the maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera number . if the deviation is below , the data will be merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no track data from one place for images , you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options Inter@@ pol@@ arity and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have adequate data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the cor@@ relate button to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same place . as the dialog tells the coordinates from one call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set using the displayed map . select the region in question and enlarge it . always select this until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to attach GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Image Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the preview pane and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page will appear .
the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is mostly self explan@@ atory . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default screen viewer , &amp; eg ; D@@ exter@@ show
the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG File Format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images .
with Other color depth , you can change the default color depth , which of course also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nails will allow you to adjust some of the settings from the Album tab for thumb@@ nails which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . click Cancel to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during creation . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as twi@@ sts , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed into a win@@ dow@@ ed mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool for changing images without compromising your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is the file size increases as there is no compression of the color information . for example , this can also be found in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team &apos;s mailing list under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. caution : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image to which you want to copy the metadata . the data will be copied by clicking the OK button .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please look at exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG encoding module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the module MPEG enco@@ ders can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ s and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual pictures you can insert a basic image transition . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD Player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG di@@ asch@@ au . afterwards , you can create the module via Tools MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au .
the images you select are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting of images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should indicate the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is set below . a low value generates very sudden , a high , very smooth picture change .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should let them black . you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all the settings according to your wishes , you can use the coding button to start generating the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now drink a cup of coffee quickly or in peace and enjoy the slideshow when you are back .
if a critic appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck Pack@@ ages using the Settings icon at the bottom .
the printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also automatically be opened using the Image Image Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve you or print out with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the raw file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now read@@ ju@@ gate the values in order to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings for the white balance should be used . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue enh@@ anc@@ ers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can process the image further later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have an effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG has a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
tagged Image Format , TIFF , retains all the information of your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your images frequently or later on , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deterior@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a memory format , the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process , you can use Cancel .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is useful if they were created in a previous attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the number and tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images in a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can res@@ ize or enlarge the image . for this purpose four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 dot ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adapt your image to the screen format .
not proportional : proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you selected . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will be displayed on the right .
you can also drag and drop images to the images list to add the list of images to be sent .
removing images will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your E @-@ Mail client with the button OK . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you selected are attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
do not pay too many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of e @-@ mails to be sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you are using the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the images are put together into a text file and attached to the mail .
the PNG format in the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original EX@@ IF data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages , searching for bugs . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the closing button you can close this window .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window appears with questions like you want to have displayed your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album here .
the Open@@ GL output option allows very elegant image transitions by means of Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option displays that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images in the lower left corner will be displayed during the presentation .
the Loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually break it with Es@@ c .
selecting images random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of pictures in the album .
the time interval between the pictures can be set between the pictures . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly , each transition between the images sel@@ ects a different effect .
during the slideshow , you can access a toolbar at the upper left corner of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn it on .
with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop slide show .
on the left bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has not currently been docum@@ enting . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team &apos;s mailing list under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. At@@ ten@@ tion : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Back@@ ground Image is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image depending on the selected option of the sub @-@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE working surface .
once you have finished your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can browse through this photo album ; see the picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , there are entries in each group , i.e. persons , places and in the group keywords .
in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and , of course , view the current thumb@@ nails .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
with this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you have selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view images of your area of activity .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined .
to view images next to the names , select the button located on the outside on the toolbar . in the appearing context menu , you can select what view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can e.g. display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you do not have suitable images for your keywords ) .
you must , however , define which image should be displayed for each individual person . in order to do this , you will need to open the image view window ( in more detail ) and select the image for the appropriate person . in the View window , you can customize the image for the appropriate person . in the View window , you can customize the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you access the search in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog at once .
if you would like , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the entire date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window you can search all the pictures by certain names as you can see in the picture . here you will find pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try out some functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; Photo@@ Album ; and select in the first dialog the demo , if you launch &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar displays date statistics about the images in your database .
you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the time bar can be inter@@ actively used in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will display this date in the preview pane ) and also the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select an area of time bar by holding down the mouse button and dra@@ gging the mouse over the ruler of the time line , i.e. the time data . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar on the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your pictures . the one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is described , which you can create via the menu File HTML ... .
before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas Content , Layout and Obj@@ ective . in the following , each section is described in more detail .
first enter the title of the overview and a description that the HTML file will contain later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings .
next , choose whether a photo@@ album ; -@@ export file is to be created which can be seen on the overview page .
finally , you can select which information should be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed , which is obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , all images are exported by a party . therefore , you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section you can define how the HTML pages should look . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically dealt with .
at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images , so those who view your website and have a monitor supporting the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 cannot download images , for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you specified . so it can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this settings area , you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select the location for all future pictures . here you can either select a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created will be started . the URL you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder , you will need to manually copy them there . so that the import function , see , correctly works you have to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings you have just described have moved all three to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in the fact whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a short@@ cut to images . the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you have all the pictures together and can pass this file so independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are found in the .@@ k@@ im file folder . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
the following will describe the dialog for ex@@ porting images you can ex@@ porting from the File menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three options are available :
with the Manu@@ ell option to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally copy to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export File option .
the last option of this page is to limit the image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you may not want to send the images in full size since the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu file ... you will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders you want to import pictures to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is named in your database . therefore , in the third dialog box you will be asked what categories of the import file to import and which categories these are in your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your present database .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump inside of different picture groups . if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will follow the various steps of ( 1 ) setting the information about your images , about ( 2 ) the search and pres@@ tige , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has started as a program to manage your images , but it has been expanded and now your videos will take care of you .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of your images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a floppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want .
if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , then you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the different settings options are explained in the following section of the user manual .
to the left , you will see six different symbols , with which you can view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call on the F1 key and click on the desired option by pressing a button .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol .
in the Options dialog , sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog you can set up full member groups , e.g. all members of a group set up at once in a group rather than all groups of a member as explained in .
in the list of options listed above , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left panel , you can find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; spl@@ its your modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ cam and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface .
modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of the photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page , which you can call over the modules itself .
since the modules are used together by several applications , it may be that the modules were tested with a photo@@ album ; only very little was tested . therefore , you should first test new modules with the demo database before using the &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say I hadn &apos;t warned you !
the applications that the modules use together with K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between the photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications simply put their pictures into albums : this is an album just a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order is not supported , it simul@@ ates order for albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
simul@@ ating &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview at the moment .
in addition to the current album , we have to pass a list of albums to the modules . here &apos;s a photo@@ album , as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you set up in the settings dialog as category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category Per@@ sons , then &amp; k@@ photo@@ album will do so , so whether you had selected people to view and pass this on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select in the module you want to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start the photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and a toolbar at the top of the toolbar . at the moment , it does not contain much information as you do not have any information about your images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , where the image has been taken . for example , each image can be displayed individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if , for example , pic@@ tured on all pictures Jes@@ per and all images are recorded in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these remarks by using the built @-@ in viewer .
see three lists with a text box where you can define people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can so that the used names are moved up to find and assign people faster .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the quote for sorting by date below the list .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected images and ann@@ ot@@ ate them with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons that are located below the picture to the right .
if you have taken several images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple read entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the US . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also in California .
in the picture you will see a browser window that displays the USA as an over@@ board . to show you that it is an over@@ board , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . additionally , you can also simply drag an entry into a category and place it there to sort it into a sub @-@ category of this entry . attention , this assumes you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . see for this .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and dra@@ gging the bars that form the top edge of the frames . you can also make a separate window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window pane .
if you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button ... which gives you among other things the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to get this window visible later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide window . see this in the picture .
if you select the entry pictures in the browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or of all images if you do not have a filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set as background image for your desktop .
once you click on an image , this will appear in the image viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the respective pictures you want to delete and either select the delete button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use the pictures somewhere , so that you can record it in the database index . in the picture you will see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all necessary pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is cli@@ pped are not stored on the hard drive . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 , the thumb@@ nails are present , so that the preview of these images can show you . however , you can also not view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you can see , this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and re @-@ copy it . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not want to ask you to insert the respective CD , please buy a larger disk to store all images on it .
in the Pictures menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures in such a way that at the end those left are left in the menu Privacy . alternatively , you can also control all the pictures that your little sister may see , control and lock the menu item All except current view .
so you have specified which images should be hidden in case of the case . if you give your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item images to be hidden . if you want to get the images displayed again , click on lock .
it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply change password in the Privacy menu .
on the one hand , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml may read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection only serves to deny the view to private pictures .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; about a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . he obviously shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter about the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag them with the mouse and move somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information should be displayed at all . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . the then appearing context menu can be seen below .
some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see the appropriate entries for this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and down . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can enter the image in and out . using the mouse button , you can easily zoom in a rect@@ angle with the mouse button . with the minus button , you can zoom in again The plus button zo@@ oms in the center of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the outcome of the zo@@ oms .
with the dot key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the key button sets the zoom , so every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that function for videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key .
with the rotation functions from the context menu you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make comments to the current image using the menu item comments from the context menu .
if you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . at the moment you can cancel the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter that name . however , you may prefer to mark only the image and view more images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to develop the images on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad as you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add pictures with characteristics as you view them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can place a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in the picture you see a picture in which the characters A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have attributes to your pictures , these are available to you in the browser . so if you have any images that you edit , print or whatever you have selected , simply put them all at once with comments . this is described in . afterwards , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you just want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview screen . if you want to view categories in a special preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you can perform a photo@@ album ; painting on the image .
the batch will not be saved with the image , but in the database . in this way you can und@@ o your painted later .
in order to complete the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select View on the image from the context menu . to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation too &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the object tree views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed to allow you to choose the correct position :
either from the Edit menu or from the right @-@ click context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to apply these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click on Apply or reject the changes with Cancel .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the Setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press on preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture will be rendered , even if you want to render just a part of the texture ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick local .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as the wire model . you can specify this value relative to the Visi@@ bility level of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when selected or their Visi@@ bility level is smaller or equal to the Visi@@ bility level selected in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need another configuration , you can set it as you like . you can also save several window orders and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below a present view , drag the user to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the user to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the beginner right in the middle of another view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the tabs at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are ho@@ vering views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to resolve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the user to the desktop or click on the small pointing arrow pointing at the bottom of the screen .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the Anf@@ al toolbar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can paste additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor it anywhere .
the current window view can be saved with the View Window System ... Save . a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them render . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar , or select Ren@@ dering the menu item View .
a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a quick preview up to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the Change settings icon in the toolbar or select View modes from the View menu , the following dialog will open :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but sense is a name that lets you recognize the characteristics of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the image , select the section sub@@ section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields .
in combination with quality you can select the properties that are used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User Manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and details are sometimes not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel in the representation . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of this error . generally , pictures with this feature look better .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculate and connect &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adapted because the super @-@ sampling refers to the neighbouring pixels . the second method is adaptive ; recur@@ sive because every pixel is split up again and again because the rec@@ laim depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between the colour values to the adjacent pixels crosses the specified threshold , a grid of 4x4 will be calculated with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 will be calculated with a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel .
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the colour values exceeds the default threshold , the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are further pursued and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called j@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on j@@ it@@ tering , alter &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
this tab allows you to determine if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is transparent when the associated beams have not hit any object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray file , select the Import @-@ File menu item ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command range of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when im@@ porting error messages or warnings occur , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object catching of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions .
if you cross high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projection , all wire model views will be further divided when the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projection . this property creates a better approach to projections , but requires more time for rendering .
when you tick the wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you tick the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you tick on edge smo@@ othing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and threshold can be adjusted . more precise information on the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender modes section .
on this page you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in the section window orders we explain how to create and save window arrangements .
the Com@@ bin@@ ation Field Standard Window System : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
a new arrangement allows you to create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Remove button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views of the selected window arrangement . new views can be created with the Add button and del@@ eting selected views with the Remove button .
with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a map view together with the previous view and ho@@ vering the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without further knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : one ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before compl@@ aining that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should observe these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will get only a black picture .
if you have installed everything correctly , see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the icons of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols often , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
to follow this guide , you first have to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit menu item . now you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you will notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , see further details .
don &apos;t change anything about the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points in the view that you can change the destination point of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a check@@ point and drag it to the desired location .
when you press the user or press the enter key , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately accordingly to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could for example insert a cube ( insert fin@@ ite body Qu@@ aders ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite layer as floor :
a good advice : select the plane in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also shows the level , al@@ beit at the moment only as a fin@@ ite fin@@ ite level . when you ren@@ ame the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree accurately , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor when clicking on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and displacement .
in this scene you should move the floor to practice a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose shift and set the values as follows :
first choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something simple .
in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can choose how to insert the object . please select First sub@@ object . the pigment will then be displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ Pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button Pre@@ view you see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pigment only shows a matte black material because you have to re @-@ enter settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you do not see any color on the rect@@ angle and sphere in the preview , click on the Apply button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is set correctly now . if you now render your image with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , these are not the colors that you expected . here are additional settings necessary . in the color list , you must enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the check@@ er@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree each time , select in color and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should be able to execute this step simply because you have already understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the enter key or the button Apply ) , so the ball contact with the ground . otherwise the ball would float above the floor as you moved the ground around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering now results in a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , put a suitable material .
if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material . as with the ground , give the ball a pigment as a color :
select First sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click on sphere Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press Enter .
the gloss effect and reflection effect already result in good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces even when metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of the possibilities offered to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or a model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken by the objects , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will affect . thus the scene pixels for pixel are processed .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is just black . obviously , any scene that should be rendered is needed some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you created previously with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . any changes since the last storage will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last und@@ o command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used edit back@@ ups .
save the current window arrangement and open a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the appearance , keyboard short@@ cuts and default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . with this option you can add commands pres@@ et to &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er using this option .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ pp@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can be displayed either in their own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ou@@ ter@@ show ; it is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can use with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n or the Return key .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can exit the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the Configuration - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and Edi@@ ting and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two others , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be specified for the respective windows .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this item is enabled , load &amp; match show ; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option saves &amp; sn@@ ail show ; when termin@@ ating the name of the last opened folder . at the next start , opens &amp; sn@@ ail show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is larger than the image , the background will be filled with the selected color here .
you can &amp; ou@@ ter@@ show ; set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
this option is used to enlarge the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
here you can change the keyboard short@@ cuts for the different modes of &amp; battery show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
shows large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows preview images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
magni@@ fies the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ zzle show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open .
view the picture in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
open the input field for completion . enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the digi@@ kam ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the edited ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform corrections and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user contributing his part to having at least problems and potential improvements .
this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page for reports of problems and wishes .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a more frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo , then we would like to ask you to answer questions from other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it &apos;s the developer mailing list to join . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . in order to access these settings , you have to select the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo . to access these settings , you have to select in the Settings Show picture ; set up the settings dialog . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should show the colors with what you want to display , in contrast .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same side@@ bar in the image processing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five tabs :
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that do not do more than scan and save images .
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan and save images . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving and save images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; with the command gu@@ l -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog to select the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and click OK to open the scanner . Cancel will &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; exit .
the other settings are more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
to scan an image , the user can only start a pre @-@ scan and then scan scan area for the final scan . the preview button will be started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom to fit the entire preview window into the window .
when the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if before the Save a preview is selected in the settings , then the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and a lie ? s leads to a demoli@@ tion and you get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select and save images . open dialog to save each image opens the dialog before each scanned image . if &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; if you want to save them automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved in the Save As option without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as the default for dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the image to be saved automatically and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is always uploaded when a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE support with the &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the knob Via starts the K@@ DE via -@@ dialog for &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite .
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library used by &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; Note : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception .
the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by right @-@ clicking in the player window and set up global keyboard short@@ cuts . you can set up the global keyboard short@@ cuts by right @-@ clicking in the player window and selecting short commands ... selecting .
you can set up any existing multimedia keys in such a way that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands function . this makes your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that can mostly also be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists browsers and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . in addition , Amar@@ ok has some custom command line options .
you should give a feedback to the user if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog to tell the user why a script does not work .
begin with require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be included in every K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages make it possible to execute external programs and commands . for this purpose , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events when there is no use for it .
configure Wei@@ st tells the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change Sign@@ aling that a new piece is played . the script might now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can query additional information about the new piece ( for example metadata or unit length ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ alizes a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths contains the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu item is cli@@ cked . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ ize men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to carry out e.g. cleaning jobs . this includes , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user &amp; z@@ b have downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar Archive ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with cat@@ amar@@ an encoding . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permissions :
if your script package is ready , you can put it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page by &amp; Amar@@ ok . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps , you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . perhaps you just search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Samm@@ et Browser and Quick Find you will find the piece within seconds .
perhaps you have already some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which one you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just right for you . and if the decision is still difficult , the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so that SI@@ E can choose how to listen to your music . this and many more useful features make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to experience your music anew !
usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources , you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should have no difficulty in comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time using the configure script . this is a list of options available .
some of the compile options have to be filled with certain dependen@@ cies so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements section .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort via the Setup dialog . the Setup dialog has several card cards to set up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if the option is turned off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
atmospheric design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . this alters the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer .
storing mood files in the music files : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . if this option is enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
save playlist when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; En@@ able this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist upon exit .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok will use ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of the music files will be stored .
keeping up @-@ to @-@ date piece when changing the play causes the play@@ lists to scroll up / down to keep the each running piece in the visible window area .
changing to the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the App@@ ear@@ ance section you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the fonts section you can select the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok . by selecting own fonts , the otherwise grey section is activated . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist window , player window and context browser . click Select ... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the color selection activated for foreground and background color .
resume play at startup causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , playback will resume automatically with the piece at the point with which it was stopped at the last exit .
setting up the On @-@ Screen display allows you to turn on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is cli@@ cked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
use own colors gives you the opportunity to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . one click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if own colors are not activated , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used .
the Display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the Screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to set the O@@ SD on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment .
the Audio Output Driver Card lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate more settings in this card .
the collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folders and type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the folders that &amp; Amar@@ ok should search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes to adjust how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the inter@@ sec@@ ted and their sub@@ folders will be searched for music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders for changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . incre@@ mental search is also performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all the found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further installation in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l facility is required .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device section will be used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok . under Calcul@@ ator : will the host enter where the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then , under Port : the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data you need to connect to the database .
the last@@ .@@ f@@ m card supports the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if necessary .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
retrieve similar interpre@@ ters : after activating this setting , the Amar@@ ok will get a list of similar performers to the played piece . you can see the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package of k@@ deli@@ bs and no further K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we wrote a small tutorial on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minim@@ ally .
some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer using bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash .
mostly this is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer using bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries were compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable automatic switch automatically when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use 1 second value .
you can also send the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if it is a common crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the bug is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ information , but do not label them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script solves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; File $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &gt; new ( $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3 &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( Rand@@ om Mode / Rep@@ eti@@ tion / Dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . note that in some cases , you have to click on a symbol up to three times until this setting shows their effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ oc@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ oc@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map , then please check that Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . you can see this with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ oc@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to customize the correct version first .
there are several possibilities . most installation problems are solved easiest by using an expert to your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter only one error there if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist appears . how do pieces of music get inside there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the interface intuitive , the Start sub @-@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the rating by the user , while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the rating column needs to be displayed in the playlist . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for one piece . you can also use the short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , then click Del@@ ete on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and then select From playlist from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let it fall , just like you would do with other files . it &apos;s that simple : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , the button can be saved . click on it .
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find it via the menu bar under Tools E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end @-@ independent approach , so the real question must be which media types are supported G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer even can de@@ code text and PNG !
it may ! perhaps you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which the default does not include MP3 deco@@ ders ( for pat@@ ent@@ able reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat , mp3 ke@@ de , enter key
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you are using the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause and solution . for Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. os@@ se@@ d@@ sink ) .
you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also deco@@ des data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center sound &amp; multimedia sound system . enable sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x has problems with K@@ DE multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buff@@ ers in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , it crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; AB . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all components . carry out a register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
then run ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer &apos;s module folder ( you will find the module folder with you @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute it again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run with this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened by the soft sounds of the music that you have stopped before going to bed .
how to find out the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running tracks when you are on another computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ ali@@ zations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ window . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ trl + Right mouse button puts a piece in the queue order in the queue . pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but how does it look with the icon in the system segment of the control bar ?
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers are to be displayed .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is placed on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and there are many error messages on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click Play Audio CD in the menu . it will open a file browser with multiple folders . for normal read , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , take files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg instead .

basically this fits the previous evaluation with a decreasing value based on how often the piece was played . the more played the piece , the less influence each individual score has on the overall result .
you can enter the evaluation for a piece by clicking on a column heading in the playlist window . then you can change the evaluation of a piece just as all other attributes , namely by right @-@ clicking on the piece and editing : select the rating or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review in the Metad@@ ata dialog .
the developers don &apos;t want you to tell you when you want to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a specified publishing plan that is not compatible with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the Option icon when playing anim@@ ate in the General Settings .

if you want to use AL@@ SA then please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore also a lot of bug reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you must &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
if G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you will need to install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same goes for x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ compile and install again .
I receive the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok .
I receive the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run it as a system administrator . then start Amar@@ ok again .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound card ?
set up in settings Amar@@ ok ... audio output will give you the device . typically , e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ v@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio , type plug sla@@ v@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter x@@ ine us@@ b @-@ audio in the setup dialog and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of converting the sampling rate , channels and so on .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick on sound card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be taken care of . you may , of course , take this problem by yourself ! if you would like , you can become the new so much needed supervis@@ or for Arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard , which will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you simply don &apos;t like your collection afterwards , or simply do not like the wizard , then this Quick Start Guide will help you . with your help you will have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set up in a few minutes .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . as any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to everyone else . the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and playlist .
the Player Window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Center . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current play , bit rate , and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . one click on this section changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time for the remaining play time of the piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the running text display . you can switch by the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the pane .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fying window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons can also be found under the scroll bar . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set the equ@@ ali@@ zer .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position sli@@ der . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the play position or volume . using the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous step .
the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own default settings .
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the Play@@ list of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most widely developed playlist of all available for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . however , don &apos;t let the abundance of functions deter you , they &apos;re all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser .
the context browser shows different information regarding the current piece . its look can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , Text and Interpre@@ t . these three sub@@ windows are later explained in detail .
if you have earlier used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you may notice that the sub@@ window has dropped off . the information presented there has now been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information can be collected in the statistics panel ( Extras statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover image of the album and besides a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to see the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find more information about the current piece . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
the images may have any names , but pictures with the word front in the name are treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will play immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpreter . this section displays the five most rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . to do so , right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current interpreter that you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
this function is very flexible and it is possible to download the text for the piece from other web pages . once you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which should be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Find button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group@@ ed only the top layer , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - first of all the pieces are arranged according to the interpreter and there is a further division after the respective album . if you want to see compil@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , then this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Differ@@ ent Arti@@ sts .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - S@@ ort by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is used .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are displayed alphabe@@ tically by each other . the artist is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpreter - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them by artist .
group@@ ing genre / interpreter / album - This setting works just like the above but is additionally sorted by album below the performer .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while .
a search filter is located directly below the toolbar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
below the search filter there is a selection box that allows you to filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also choose from the last 24 hours up to one year .
clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser gives you the following options .
load - This emp@@ ties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
app@@ end to play@@ lists - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry , you will reach the same effect .
set pieces to queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be prompted for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces to the queue to transfer to the Media Player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player Browser .
burn all pieces of this performer / burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) Move files to the tr@@ ash bin ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under Various Arti@@ sts .
pick up a selection list - edit a record selected as a compilation album back into a normal album . after that the album will not be shown again under different performers but again under the corresponding interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to deal with a lot of play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes Intelligent Play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at runtime . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
you can also add smart play@@ lists created by yourself . click on Intelligent Play@@ lists to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod would be included . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sorted in the top list view of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list of performers . by doing this , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . if the transfer is finished , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and resolve the drive connection for your iPod .
the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all the files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser is an address bar with which you can get music from a given URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping . in this case , holding down the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply dra@@ gging the entries with the mouse to the desired position . once you enter characters , only the pieces will be displayed , which contain the letters . to reset the filter press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter search terms separated by spaces , then &amp; Amar@@ ok will search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter one or two , search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter OR between the search terms , you will be searched for entries that contain either the one or the other search term . for example , one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found containing one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose qu@@ e@@ ens : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that include Mike Old@@ field , but not by entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you may also look for larger or smaller . for example , Rating : &gt; 50@@ . This search for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variations as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this search for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath .
you can set the sequence of records by pressing the C@@ trl key , and then right @-@ click on the entries . the entries then get a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the playlist &apos;s toolbar is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left , you find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist .
next , the buttons will follow und@@ o and restore . this allows you to und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar is a unique , larger analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you get in the player window by right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for the toolbar , for example playback control and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on menu and selecting toolbar buttons ...
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval can be changed easily by double clicking on the respective display area with the mouse .
you can also hide the status bar . by default , disable status bar in the General Settings .
the contex@@ tual menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the playlist in the playlist . through this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
one click on this entry will open the Windows Visu@@ alization Plugins . there you can select the Visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry is a sub @-@ menu with short@@ cuts to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool to manage your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover management in your collection browser .
the cover management includes a list view of all the albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left side .
with the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover management . select from :
after you set a piece into the queue , a number next to the title appears in the playlist . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will be played : 1 will be played first , 2 second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces to the playlist or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already predefined ( the details for setting up these follow later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random items while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audi@@ osc@@ ale ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
double click on the playlist you want , drag them into the playlist window , or right click on it and then select Load . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist .
the two pre @-@ set modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix immediately fill in your playlist and you can start playing directly . the play@@ lists that you receive begins with an empty playlist and you have to add at least one piece from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at least one piece , so your playlist will be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point . the dynamic mode can be disabled via the same menu entry .
the New button re@@ fill the current playlist and add new pieces according to the dynamic mode . edit Play@@ list opens the playlist to edit the playlist and you can change the settings .
with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the ability to click Edit . as a result , the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist here , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will grow continuously , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ignored and they will not hear dup@@ licate in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed while resp@@ ecting the play@@ mate tunes .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each play . if you select more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the right @-@ hand settings have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can select from already existing playlist or smart play@@ lists . if you click multiple play@@ lists , then &amp; Amar@@ ok ; random items from each of the play@@ lists you have checked .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on Configuration .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by clicking on the script . after you have installed the script , a new entry will open in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script any longer , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to be deleted and then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to the Scrip@@ ts section .
the Visu@@ alization Plugins dialog window is used to enable the available visu@@ ali@@ zations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name .

V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : an auth@@ oring system fully equipped for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ nice effect that the music pieces are reproduced differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to be able to boot from CD and to automatically play all the videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project .
save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
saves the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed with which you can choose folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
stores all open projects . this is the same as if you would call for each project file Save .
close the current project . if a project has been modified and not saved yet , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . furthermore , you can stop closing and keep the project so open .
includes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what to do with it just as if you have called for each project file C@@ lose .
includes all open projects and finishes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project will be asked what to do with it as if you had called file C@@ lose .
when you access this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the basic folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button Burn , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is the ? -@@ aid described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it will cause &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful if you are not using files for a multiple session CD . it is intended for you rather than help , so that you can see the files and folders already available on the medium .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function will cause &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project .
open the CD copy dialog . this also allows you to copy a CD onto a different medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD , which you can then burn some@@ time later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this allows you to create a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create one copy of a DVD , which you can burn later on . besides , there is also the possibility of copying a DVD with the help of copy dialogue . therefore , the target medium must be large enough to be able to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , so the content will be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; allows you to choose between the writing modes Excel and incre@@ mental .
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button .
this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the inserted media . this information is displayed in the contents view and contain the properties of the medium , such as the size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is checked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their contents will be shown in the contents view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media info , locks and unlock the drive or reject the medium .
the contents view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided a drive has been selected in the folder view with an appropriate CD / DVD .
the head@@ line is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line does not have a real function , it only looks nice and clearly separates the project view from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box for changing the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after you have selected one of the available commands in the top part , you can adjust the key mapping to the bottom .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; Setup Wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator privileges are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at startup .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work immediately . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine @-@ tuning the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can , for example , be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and type of task is more important , which of the two programs will give you preference .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to be able to use the d@@ co@@ p command line , you have to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following at the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions like copy@@ cd , format@@ ted DVD and other functions to create new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void sp@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void Bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void Bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively one can generate a project on the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which is applicable only to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String Transpar@@ ent ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ String Transpar@@ ent ) void remo@@ ve@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ program ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Sel@@ ection for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it , quite simply audio CD ; s can be read and stored in mp3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on your computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the U@@ I of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in wa@@ v files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that en@@ code these WAV files . currently l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) are supported by default ( these enco@@ ders need to be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on your computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed into mp3 or O@@ GG format or even in other formats such as loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed yet , this must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ Vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders have already been installed , so it is probably not necessary to compile something by yourself . however , only the enco@@ ders need to be installed which are needed . if , for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which encoding / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction on enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device does not convert the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass any copy protection . simply avoid buying copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only needs to be done once ( the setup dialog however can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , afterwards the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , and everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . see Step by Step , for example , more information on how to use this program , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of tabs for configur@@ ing the program .
starts the CD@@ DB inquiry of the CD data according to the set up of request in the CD@@ DB Tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must be established . )
start reading and - when an encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab - the encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder , so that the selection can be read with a different encoder than the default . it must be noted that previously the encoder was configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already selected file is selected for encoding rather than a complete &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , be@@ eps ) for program events ( such as reading out the &amp; CD ; quit ) .
opens the Main Setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as enco@@ ders , to set up the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , encoder and compression ratios and helps you choose the right coding .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are also others such as &apos; shor@@ ts &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences become less important as both enco@@ ders generate very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ High to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG low quality at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG recording devices is available .
MP3 - when music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format .
a short list of audio quality parameters and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression ratio up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . requires always 256 b@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music by you@@ ths , portable devices and auto @-@ ster@@ oids . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or automatically fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand over / needed with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the title to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audio creator must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs instead of entering the information themselves . it must be noted that only text is spoken here : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( referring to the author ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is active to dial a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fake ) address as the one in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address will not be used when accessing the data from the server ( This can only be the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally nearest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org delivers a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from CD ; in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading out audio CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this is not yet done .
for saving the read WAV files , the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected . at first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added to the encoder . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the enco@@ ders package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the encoder can be used . this is also required for pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . further information on enco@@ ders is found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a encoder you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read , and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and our first &amp; CD ; read out . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 called keywords ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found , for example , with a search engine , as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own write permissions ( eg ; trying to copy something into it with the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; something that will probably only be done once and
the second section describes how to proceed to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each excer@@ pt &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ ders to use ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . because we are la@@ zy , we tell the program to use the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any time of reading a &amp; CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program to read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of device names for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the tab General Settings . here is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is loaded / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
in case of incomplete information , select query , so that you will be informed when information is missing for generating key words ( tags ) .
the card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : while reading the &amp; CD , the computer must be connected to the Internet so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; . this is associated with low risk , if you later are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can be easily changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ cher .
you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB big , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . in order to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two choices must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data the CD should be received ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . put it all the way it is shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we did not download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org page and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equally as far as the server is concerned , since many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the internet .
in this example , we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously interpre@@ ting pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , so simply try it yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cross this to the &amp; CD &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; disc@@ ard it at the end of the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you cross this , then / / the path / folder can be specified in which the WAV files are stored . this can be useful if there is only space on another disk . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files themselves .
set everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V1 and V@@ 1.@@ 1.@@ &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags can be deleted upon request . in case of subsequent change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and output file ( including the complete path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded WAV files : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can try to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have clever@@ ly chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change them again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure , which is organized on the hard drive , is described in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is built up as we are comfortable and want to pick up data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each out@@ going &amp; CD .
since we do a &amp; CD ; use those not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from the data collected for a &amp; CD ; with success from fre@@ ed@@ b fet@@ ched data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; to manually insert data instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , then the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , then go to the section Questions and Ans@@ wers after the Help or go back to the previous section concerning basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully fet@@ ched by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; a window will be displayed and you can select the database entry that best fits your &amp; CD .
if you do not select the check box for automatic query by fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the sample on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece .
the comment field of the album will be used for comments that apply for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , but it contains already the data as shown in the screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you can not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you will have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio creator ; this option is set on the encoding settings tab ; take a look at the section &apos; Basic Settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also re @-@ create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all coding or file formats . please refer to the encoder for more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of an aperture CD . in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; -@@ data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ Editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece definitely and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button on the toolbar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed above the parts list .
note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the All items button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
was started by clicking on the selection button selection of the reading process , this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will throw a look at the window with the orders and keep track of what is going on .
click on the Order tab to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right under the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to check the jobs . the first piece is currently being read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message appears when you try to work with a encoder that you have not yet installed . items that were not successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
assignment 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 in the format MP3 . thus , read and code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code . for powerful machines , the result is unclear . the machine used with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem at simultaneous reading and coding ( of course , two different pieces ) .
now the last piece is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CVS is used as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; install the k@@ de@@ multimedia package from your distribution . if you read this , you probably already have done it ...
this section is intended for people who compile from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre@@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help as the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls on many different programs has many settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different map maps of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the Help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any indication of how to proceed from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it all about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot keep this manual intact . it is the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; it is intended . if you read this , he left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion .
strange if you have managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke game of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others , he has also some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time ampli@@ fication of lyrics , which other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color so that it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag &amp; drop ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid can pull .
supports both existing standards to save text into MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used .
sitting Support . when you exit &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , k@@ mid starts again with the same song again next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with several songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the toolbar , select the entry from the menu item , or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will automatically start as soon as you click on the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played succ@@ essively . )
once you play a piece , you can jump to any location by using the middle mouse button and moving the controller back and forth .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly , you can click the arrows left and right of the tempo display and adjust the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar appears like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry Pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts the playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the play .
lyrics can be stored in one piece of music in two ways . some pieces use text , others use lyrics and others use both . some pieces don &apos;t have a text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the type of event is automatically determined which uses a song so you don &apos;t have to manually adjust the kar@@ aoke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to set a type of event , select the menu items and song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you merge . these are played by the series . in this section you can learn how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu Collection under the point Organ@@ izing .... Click here on New and specify the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired items in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . remember this when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song by button Add a song . it again appears the file dialog with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to Collection .
when automatic adding to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
when adding Automati@@ cally to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when a piece is opened .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the row from the sub@@ menu play@@ lists of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select Next Song , next song item from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to reverse a song skip , select the button Previous piece , select the Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but it does not matter as it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers which are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates General MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano into events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
unfortunately there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( using your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all the required trans@@ formations for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the Key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so that I can offer support in future releases of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section describes how General MIDI patches are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you must not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds that this instrument needs to play on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) that sounds like a gun shot .
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes a patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that the term Dr@@ ums @-@ Patch is meant to represent a different percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to indicate how tones are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as is its presence , so you must create 128 items .
you can define multiple key maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key maps are used mainly to map tones on perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . take a look at the included key maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swa@@ p the first and second channel , simply do it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel , which is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key map with the name name for that channel will be defined . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all occur@@ ren@@ ces that attempt to change the patch on this channel will be ignored . in this case , patch x is always used .
for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio adju@@ sts in what ratio pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if therefore a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid decim@@ al decim@@ al in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM pre@@ tends that a keyboard that receives a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two sounds higher up to one oc@@ tave . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to play a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog .
the channel view is a window with a whole set of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the view in the Settings menu under the point of channel view : settings
the tempo @-@ LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you get a similar sound quality . with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all the files individually .
OK , therefore support &amp; k@@ mid ; Drag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
make sure to enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; k@@ de ; desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI Fol@@ der and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
if you want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn off the Automatic Add to Collection setting , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ M@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . At first you just want to play the first file . so set the automatic addition to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , it encourages me to continue programming .

if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ .exe @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you can send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact me under Friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; if you want to send me a MIDI file , you should contact me , as I might already have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and won &apos;t get money from anyone . I would like to point out that I only get further programming because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .

a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you do not have a sound card , you need to compile and sound with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music , of course .
if there are any problems , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ on@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to playback video files of formats supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on , as well as for playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called do@@ cking windows . there is always a window with a central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred connections under the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category persistent play@@ lists .
of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy level . if you click an entry , its group and all its sub@@ sets will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the associated entry .
the various files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / apps categories can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category , select from the View menu and next edit mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part will be displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to select the play@@ lists from the Play menu and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without using the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player ; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation at startup and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and alter@@ ing &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 ob@@ last option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; S@@ MB ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would be annoying in the end animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .

there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; . here the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; button in the toolbar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player intentionally .
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything has to be configured by manually editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , like setting up the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f co@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; S@@ MB ; it can even play the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
in order for the &amp; S@@ MB player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as a service provider for the application / x @-@ shock wave flash in the Setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE must be specified .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
to always use a pre @-@ specified back@@ end for a specific mim@@ e type ( of course only if this is determined ) , this must be done by changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all o@@ gg files :
&amp; S@@ MB ; can play from TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be seen , the device to be used must be configured and the TV channels have to be configured . to do so , the scanner can be used in the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing V@@ DR ( Video Data Records ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port should be detected . there should be found ports to be used ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b contained in it .
since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of recording of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . therefore , for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , the following must be contained in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , various names are used by KM@@ Player for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ sp@@ ection , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ en. when they are activated , they start playing the playlist .
is there any evidence that I can qui@@ eter my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as user root to run after the device has been installed . it is absolutely necessary to make sure / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts up slowly , why does my CPU have to be tested for performance every time ?

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support , and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le ;
L@@ ate@@ x ; : a professional writing application . among Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be used on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; resp@@ . &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components may be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution should be included in the distribution or installation CD / DVD .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project includes some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow for easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; -@@ website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the Ki@@ le ; website .
if you have questions about the compile @-@ up of &amp; ki@@ le , or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed at the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the ability to use all &amp; latex ; capabilities in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; latex ; programs . in conclusion , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; latex ; reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its options should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; start .
for &amp; latex ; is the correct language : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use is also a lay@@ man ( in@@ lay ) &amp; latex ; mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while only a good overview of &amp; latex is given , it is not the ultimate book for it . to be properly profi@@ cient , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the introduction contains at least the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
the quick entry wizard by &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some possibilities for creating the document . you can also make some settings related to the document .
documentation classes : this explains the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , poster &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projector &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , projector &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
coding : this is used to set the encoding of the system . modern systems increasingly use U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be protected ( for correct processing of the &amp; latex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used auxiliary equipment for natural latex ; for integration , they only need to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used in the preparation of German texts .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is just a brief description of the features and further information on this will be given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . if you see green areas of a green text on the screen , it is with great lik@@ el@@ ihood that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , you will be spar@@ ed by the modest appearance of the output file . however , you will save time and money by high@@ lighting .
with automatic completion of the environments will be created when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { Command } ) by &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the associated line to lock the command ( e.g. \ \ end { Command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X Comm@@ ands .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows to sub@@ divide the document into the following elements ( the highest and sub@@ paragraph of the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of a mouse .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files may be very helpful . once a DVI ; file has been created , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding row in &amp; latex ; -@@ source text .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the default output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and devices .
when selecting the link , the elements of the DVI ; file are used with the editor and as soon as an item has been cli@@ cked in the DVI ; file , the exact opposite of it . as soon as on a section in the &amp; latex ; source text was cli@@ cked , the corresponding position in the DVI ; -@@ viewer jumps .
master document : this function is used when working with several files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide Master document can be set over project project settings .
quick Building : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there is no error in the source code ) .
file Monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; file is called up @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line , and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick @-@ release .
when viewing the Edit toolbar , the three large selection boxes should be noticed . the selection boxes were developed for the quick classification of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; statements for sub@@ division are :
the selection box Other is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , joint notes or references . the available options are :
name : with this command , a name for a section , an image or other element is created .
reference : is used for reference to a specified term ( selection on a selection box possible ) .
at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are required editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last field of selection with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for defining the font size . it can be specified for the font size for the main text , the joints , etc . the following font sizes are available :
when calling &amp; ki@@ le ; two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from bottom to hand .
the brackets after the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font size . if the font size is not specified at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
once the above source code sample has to be entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is using the Men@@ ue Build or the button quick construction .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically removes the storage .
if the document comp@@ iling fails , it should be searched for errors in logging . if this is not the case , logging should also be considered .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font size . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ c@@ row and \ \ end { environment } will then grant a copy of the fonts within the environment .
the changes will only be verified within the environment ( of \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many ways to maximize the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . you can , for example , add certain fonts , bold print , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands will either end with the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for ital@@ ics and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a set can be represented with \ \ up@@ h { Word } ital@@ ics .
\ \ ratio : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language was presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made for better read@@ ability of the document . this should include a quote , a few passages in bold and bold print and a poem to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , editor @-@ view or C@@ trl @-@ E can be returned to the editor ( with the internal viewer ) .
once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try it and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ pc ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as for creating the document are necessary ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed using File ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar allows converting the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file is made of the &amp; latex ; source code was created , the conversion into desired other formats can begin by using the buttons in the toolbar .
the pre @-@ select search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; -@@ bin@@ aries . to do this , only Modern under Settings Ki@@ le has to be set up ... Tools Building can be selected .
to do the job search , the mouse @-@ cursor must be positioned in a line of the source text and then be cli@@ cked on preference . the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI ; the viewer is then done .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; latex ; -@@ Document of &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and bound to the corresponding line .
if there is no error when using fast construction of the &amp; DVI , an error can be present . should an error occur , this will be displayed in the log in the log message or in the message window .
the log message file indicates the error source in the source text . in the editor , the buttons of La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ h@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for le@@ aps between the errors . the error in logging must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the defective line .
once you click on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template you want to use for the document . the default options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . for more information , see the section .
¤ u@@ fi@@ ge users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by exec@@ uting an existing document and selecting a file template from document ... Create .
when creating a new document from a template by file New , some strings are replaced with other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings ... Settings dialog .
when creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ : this string is replaced by entry into document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ &#93; { items } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be executed :
when creating a new document , the own template can then be selected instead of the default ones .
a template can be created from any and natural latex ; files are created . in a simple way to create a template , search for a template found on the Internet and the steps described below are searched .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting from many different types of text files ( including also &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its possibilities , the manual to K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can be there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; start .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference which can be called over the menu La@@ Te@@ X Reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; use and syntax .
double @-@ clicking with the C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; word . this means that in this way you \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys on the Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse and highlight the most varied types of source texts . for example , the &amp; latex functions ; statements from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can add additional jump marks . it is a separate type of book@@ mark within the text . the menu entries edit jumps or the corresponding keyboard short@@ cuts make the jump to the next or last jump stamp .
the Edi@@ ting is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent features have been added in &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source code always added &amp; ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection .
this extended meaning does not include a text with continuous lines ( as in other text editors ) . this expanded meaning exclu@@ des tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only explo@@ iting thing in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is that the paragra@@ phs are separated by two blank lines .
select the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command also supports &amp; latex ; commands with a back@@ pack ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , it can be removed first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; C@@ ate ; provides the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides with own commands here for a faster possibility . under Edit , the following commands are included for deletion of the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description of the paragraph paragraph .
it has already been pointed out that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore offers &amp; ki@@ le ; for further orders under Edi@@ ting Environment for a possible simple work with &amp; latex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) .
if the cursor is before or within the \ \ begin { Environment } command , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , you can quickly lose sight of the environment . this command completes the most recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not disturbed .
&amp; Ki@@ pling ; also provides special orders for the &amp; latex ; groups defined by brackets { ... } . under Edi@@ ting Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from editing environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) .
if the cursor is in front of or behind the cur@@ ly bracket of a &amp; tex ; group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted groups @-@ bra@@ ces it is possible to get lost quickly . this command completes the most recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple quotes are used as bed tags . for practical implementation is used in &amp; boxes ; the sign &quot; used for two simple quotes . &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and fills two close @-@ up signs for &amp; latex ; a .
this automatic entry of the double quotation marks can be set up under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used for specific settings ( such as n@@ au@@ di or french ) and there@@ with German or French characters . there are also many other languages available .
when you press Shift , enter &amp; kick ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , it is not only a line break but also the command \ \ item .
close up &amp; ki@@ le within a table environment ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an adjacent line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X can be added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thus all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . while pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; search &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab@@ ul@@ ator in the above line .
although &amp; k@@ not ; already provides a good source code completion , this in &amp; box has been extended . there are three different modes installed . these work three as needed and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different modes of work under Settings Ki@@ le ... can be adjusted .
at the beginning of a new environment using the \ \ begin { environment } will be &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically added to the command \ \ end { Environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and , unfortunately , the complete list of letters becomes more complete . on the other hand , the list can be reduced by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , by &amp; Ki@@ le ; also jump @-@ marks are added , so that a simple jump to these positions is possible by editing jump @-@ marks Next jump stamp and the desired parameters can then be added .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... boxes ; complete can be adjusted to these lists . there can be different W@@ alls for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands as well as wi@@ ews of the general language @-@ use can be selected .
the command mode is not useful for complete environments . a few letters with \ \ begin will always have to be entered and the call of complete mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for the complete destruction of environments .
the command to open the environment is automatically inserted and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the environment can be continued in the simplest way and can be stopped by pressing the input key .
once this is done , the environment will be closed again automatically . once &amp; ki@@ le ; recognise that it is a listing environment , even a first \ \ item command is included .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... boxes ; complete can be done to these lists . this mode uses the List of Rem@@ uner@@ ation Mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; commands .
&amp; Ki@@ pling ; support custom lists of he@@ aters which are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... boxes can be set up . for example , a c@@ w@@ l file contains the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word &apos; complete &apos; mode is introduced over the Edit menu or the key C@@ trl + Alt spac@@ eb@@ ar , the character L will be replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
large stret@@ chers are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many offices are written in a document more than once . there@@ with offers &amp; ki@@ le ; the completion for all already written calls .
this mode can be set up in the menu Set@@ ting Ki@@ le ... to complete the box . here , the threshold for the display of the complete damage can also be specified .
the complete files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / complete / chest / complete / chest / complete / chest / complete / chest / complete / chest / complete / chest / complete / chest / complete / chest / complete / chest / complete / chest / complete / chest / complete / chest / complete / chest / complete / chest / complete / chest / complete / chest / complete / chest / complete / chest .
the Graphics dialog allows graphics to be used as simple as possible . to view the basics to the graphics formats , the paragra@@ phs and paragra@@ phs should be considered .
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for nam@@ ing and re@@ ordering pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
in order to be able to examine the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all tools are group@@ ed in the menus in the Create comp@@ iling , Cre@@ ating and Gener@@ ating View .
for comp@@ iling the source text for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the keyboard short@@ cut Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be viewed in the standard viewer by Alt ; 3 , using alt ; 4 the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file and viewed by the alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Quick Building instruction , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will open each time .
a new project is about the project New Project .... This is where the following information is requested for the project :
when exec@@ uting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ le@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be administered over scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet finished and can be added to other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts is in &amp; ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) with the following methods has :
&amp; latex ; is a fairly extended system where basic functions can be expanded with a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a lot of different help to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ til ; comes with a lot of documents . included are documentation for the included pack@@ ets and an additional &amp; latex ; reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete instruction manual for the &amp; latex ; commands contain and is thus ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; boxes ; in three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents delivered with those &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ til ; the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ til ; the small application tex@@ do@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; boxes ; delivered documents and for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the big advantage is the search for package names or keywords . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .
a double click with the mouse or the key of the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ pling ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; -@@ source text editor available on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ working surface environment . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , thus &amp; ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; can be executed with installed OS @-@ X .
much thanks to those who are striving for the continuation of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and can offer for many hours for the development of tools that we all can use in observ@@ ance of the &amp; GNU ; license . up @-@ to @-@ date information on the contribut@@ ors there is in the menu help Excel &amp; Ki@@ le ; .

&amp; sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for emails . the signatures process you in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; . with the command line interface you generate random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out . due to many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can design your emails more varied and unique .
for daily signatures the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read . for each day , use different signatures for each day , as in the random signatures you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N file New ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section , click on the &amp; lt ; empty signatures ; and add in the bottom section your new signature . signature @-@ example Kon@@ qi J@@ acks @ k@@ de@@ .org ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then remove from the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross in the toolbar .
here you can select short commands for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the Custom button at the bottom of the button and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the key or key combination .
for the use of &amp; k@@ ew ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature from the output of a command .

specify the name of the file as the result should have named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
the plug@@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , have to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plugin system very powerful . you can immediately profit from additional functionality and do not need to wait until someone uses the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements .
to install a plugin or a part , we start with the Edit Plugins menu . this opens the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all of the included plug@@ ins and add new ones . we describe every &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , this path is used to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for uniqu@@ eness identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze + button . the currently selected member ( its identity ) appears fat after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of their own identity are important with regard to news and notes . see for further information on comments .
in addition to the overview of their team , there is another benefit by cap@@ turing the team members : an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something is happening . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something is happening in the project . an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project , so later it can be looked like a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file in CVS as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the event configuration page of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties Di@@ alo@@ ges events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
to enter notes is simple . either the note entry can be selected from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword is entered in a comment field followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the team member , role plays a role in the project from the following options : team Leader Sub@@ project Leader Fol@@ lowing the area and sub @-@ project leaders , the corresponding area or sub @-@ project names should be given , as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case , but spaces around the brackets and the name : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using Settings Qu@@ anta ... This dialog extends over a few pages that are treated consec@@ u@@ tively .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; concerning tags including car completion can be modified with it . the entries are :
large / lower@@ case of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal Groß / lower@@ case means the tags are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically added attributes . normal Groß / lower@@ case means the attributes are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags : if checked , tags for which the closing tag is optional , will be added immediately after &amp; gt ;
do not include optional tags automatically : as for all other tags except for simple tags .
start and finish date automatically : when turned on , the corresponding tag will be updated and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters to the corresponding coding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ s for the detection of different types of files .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created files or other files opened with file opening ( where the encoding of the file can be b@@ yp@@ assed ) . however , this setting is carried out by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been recognized . however , this setting is carried out by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that the document can be restored from this backup during the next launch of the program . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in its own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
reset the window settings to the default on the next start is useful when the user interface is mess@@ ed up by changing the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message section is used to control the display of warnings by means of hooks of no longer promp@@ ting .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the PL@@ - and source code view in shared mode . see the different modes .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree representing the representation of par@@ ser nodes in the document can be adjusted in details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the structure tree settings , the visibility of nodes in the tree , the update frequency of the tree when editing and how deep when changing the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty nodes are the blank areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid . this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the I@@ f@@ clause Ab@@ brevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
plug@@ ins are part @-@ applications of third party , which can be re @-@ used by any part @-@ capable application , the most known and kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not located at a standard as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is given to the plugin when starting , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; load component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read @-@ only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check whether the plug @-@ in refuses to load the load . only @-@ read Parts usually refuse to load if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plugin : if this is checked , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting has been completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , as well as the support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented which allows different implem@@ entations via plug@@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , which adds support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
using the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin select field , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . normally appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions . normally appears in the bottom dock .
a view in which the output ( like in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . normally appears in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , anything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bu@@ gging needs . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally you do not have to pay attention to it .
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gger session Star@@ ts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or ends the listening according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and send information on the monitored variables as well as the current line . if this happens , while the script is stopped , execution continues .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens , while a script is stopped , execution continues .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next statement in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next statement in the script , where it is bl@@ ended into functions and include if possible .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if there is not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered that is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
this dialog allows you to enter a variable or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; adapt to your needs and how to help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help get better .
document Type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to give support for mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; capabilities like car completion and node trees to make . their simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two ways , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages respectively &amp; CSS ; and Tag@@ XML files with extension .@@ tag@@ . tool bars are handy , symbolic links of image buttons ( above the editing pane ) that insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the day shows . the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars enable fast insertion of tags in a document without a risk of a write error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they only contain the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags but contains nothing else than just element type .
the tag type is a script function . when used , &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( family 2 only )
only valid for class class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family only 2 )
only applies to the type method . specify the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
when yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , there are further tags describing how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
returns the source code used to fill in the tag editor dialog and the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; will be used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that assem@@ bles the elements of a list together . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can happen only once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the item is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each and lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this item is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be specified . this element is a single element type .
specifies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
whit@@ esp@@ ace affects nothing , but make sure &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; . this will not cause a leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; start window and select Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear , its simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available yet . currently , checking is performed only when loading Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
the following is an example of a family 1 tag XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 tag XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; upload function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D Edit DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = User 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be created by setting actions ... clicking New Action leads to the same dialog :
the keyboard short@@ cuts assigned to this action . by clicking on the Custom button , a keyboard short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful type of action . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even the quick start dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us uses : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with PID of the running &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above listed methods , a script can input &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; at the default input . in the input field input can be determined what to send to the default input .
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
there are two types output : normal output , written to standard output ; error messages , to the default output . it can be specified , what should be done with the text written on the standard output by setting the value of the output sel@@ ector :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create their own toolbar . in given case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the pop @-@ up .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings .
the parts of this window are pretty self explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts the editing mode .
fill in all required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar .
complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use it , select &quot; Edit Tag &quot; dialog when available to allow input when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol , that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ do ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Other Programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels as standard , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size to others .
please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
with regard to the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green will usually be interpreted as loose , star@@ ched , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will indicate that clicking this symbol will add a &amp; lt ; start@@ date ; tag will be inserted in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it must still be connected with the action . this happens via the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . besides the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags , so it still exists , or confirm with OK to finish .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the toolbar to set up dialog using Settings Tool@@ bars . make sure the desired toolbar is selected .
after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the toolbar .
for example , I would like a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ator supports group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar has to be tested by mastur@@ b@@ ating all symbols to make sure everything works .
after New@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created im@@ root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust its toolbar ( s ) to be loaded ( will ) when a file is opened from the appropriate folder .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; -@@ documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; repository whether someone has already done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = func@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tac@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known boundary for the box depth ( except by reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder will be displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing , but make sure &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resource files are replaced .
for example , when writing a function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help the documentation should be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( context list ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of Con@@ text @-@ separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file doc@@ r@@ c simply to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information such as which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; repository for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the out@@ going resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or anyone else . at different points , there is an e @-@ mail menu item , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the script tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . the contributions are reviewed and only made available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publishing . to make a contribution , we recommend that the source of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for your private g@@ pg @-@ key after your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the dialog New resource , the input fields must be filled out ( URL Pre@@ view can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool bar toolbar , and begin in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examines and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing . in case of problems , it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed , a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in tag XML format . there is a simpler way to automatically convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Load and Con@@ vert menu . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description to be used . then the following dialog will appear :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defini@@ tions line : the string that is in ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d to appear
fine tuning of D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , add &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to be able to understand these and to take full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; therefore , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little benefit .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the work area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available to anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the cart@@ ons with information and the tool@@ bars . please insert in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the tabs with the right mouse button in order to receive a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all file tabs , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jumping to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the Editor area leads to another context menu regarding the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , edit the file under the mouse poin@@ ter , or open the file if the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of tool bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now you can insert the data for that exactly inserted day . if they want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , to open and ro@@ am them . in the representation with tabs are available for files , project , templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , upload or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be done with the then displayed contex@@ tual menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , an entire website &amp; etc .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the appropriate user and templates in projects are only usable in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . clicking with the left mouse button lets you access the available information to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script .
with this view , one displays the internal structure of the active document . by clicking an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right clicking an element , a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , it can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the entry system , aligned to the content , allows to change all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development . you can download pre@@ packaged documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added , edited and viewed by project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tabs at the bottom of the window can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed indicate all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the toolbar buttons are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the toolbar is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the toolbar as compressed T@@ ar Archive over &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool bar in an email , you can save and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files on your system . therefore auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that is not an older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PAT@@ H in front of its bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a stand@@ alone , exten@@ sible mark@@ up language editor would ? well , this would make it the absolutely greatest Web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer restricted to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now already well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for that the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be captured that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; following , in good use of free software , the idea of Why developers , what someone else has developed , but it allows users and developers to expand and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; so to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by program @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more detailed documentation is available with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and looked after by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest entry being taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look in the section on templates . should they attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converts the special characters to &amp; HTML when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board , so they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting instruction .
converts the text from the clip@@ board to &amp; URL , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor day .
switch off the block sel@@ ector . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
goes directly to a line number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script outputs error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of script actions and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
removal and switching of the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries Previous or Next , depending on the cursor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear group@@ ed in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows for example , to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project is managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects you will find the details explained .
loads a project toolbar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this only creates the name . actions must be added by setting actions ... Add tool bars are saved by toolbar buttons , or you will be asked when you exit if you want to save the toolbar .
removes a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar yet , you will be asked if you want to do so .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the toolbar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows up@@ loading tool bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed without updating the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and does not exist in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current tag creation dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activating or de@@ activating the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting by tool bar is denied when this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the above @-@ mentioned menu items . click on them . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it .
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
sel@@ ects the type of line @-@ ending identi@@ fier . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms for development . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; with the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries the switch can sometimes need time or cause un@@ nice graphics . it is recommended that card card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode that corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an entry will enable the corresponding sub@@ window to be activated .
enables displaying the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog will affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
al@@ ig@@ ns the behaviour of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar , or add which can be added and the sequences can change .
this should create a help according to the mouse poin@@ ter &apos;s environment , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , as e.g. after completing the project name , the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be adjusted using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering Name , file is filled in automatically .
this is the name of the project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you enter the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote host &apos;s setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where templates for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to add files from the local file system to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content that you would like to download and modify . in case of ser@@ vers@@ al scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
check if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project will be included . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook it up .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder are displayed and you can make an exact selection according to coup@@ ons .
this displays a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , clips out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be changed in the Project Properties menu in the sub@@ window profiles or modified using the Shift ; F@@ 7 key short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to above , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read in more about project views .
this allows the de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently , only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information on Gu@@ bed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set using the Options button .
in the sub @-@ window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by creating an own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can disable event actions and add , modify or delete events . event actions are executed when a previously defined event occurs , such as saving a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project that was opened .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project menu or the Project Symbol Project open from the toolbar . the Project Properties dialog will appear and allows selecting a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files will find . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and open with ... in the context menu available with the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
allows removal of the current profile . if there is only one profile , then the button is blin@@ ded to prevent removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten at program time . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ safe password on the disk save option does not come into question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many high @-@ loading profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed :
this is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should select from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use them at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so that it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain@@ text .
a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , that is , by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened , opened , or deleted in the Project or Project Tool@@ bar , accessible via the toolbar &apos;s toolbar project toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to your own way of working .
as already mentioned above , tool bars are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is best to use the toolbar buttons . use and add differ . adding toolbar buttons is discussed below in the Adding toolbar .
the toolbar and the icons can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which with New Action , a New toolbar can be created , which results in the dialog where you can specify which actions on this or other toolbar can be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a toolbar , the entries add action and edit actions that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings Tool@@ bars ... and set Settings ... Settings .
templates are basically fac@@ tual skel@@ et@@ ons , code schn@@ itzel and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in example the limitations you set for the file system .
some templates provided with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; templates delivered have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents by links ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in template tree under global templates .
documents can be of any text document type . on the basis of these templates new documents can be created . typically , more specified documents are written in appropriate sub@@ folders . you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in a proper way to be efficient .
this type of templates is useful when not creating a new document based on a template but the same text area again and again in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples are found in template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and choose File As Tem@@ plate Save As Local Tem@@ plate ....
once this has happened , you will notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . check the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File Save as template to save as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be dra@@ gged and dropped onto the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as drag and drop or insertion into the kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
in the file tree or in project files , you can select a folder on the right and choose a site template , enter and back up a name for the template . by default , the project folder will be saved , but of course it can be saved as local or global template .
project templates provide a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can set he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . additionally , you can keep an eye on some things while using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates / Qu@@ anta / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates .
to specify the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties in the Properties menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the default folder view . if a root folder is set to such a way , it would generally disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . if nothing appears , one is likely to be in a root folder .
allows pre @-@ set or copied text for templates in this folder . this could be general header lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers by copying content templates into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , the context menu ( pointing to the right mouse button ) has a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one location to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source editor that can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ Page and a cursor appear . then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor where necessary changes are made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; to edit it , the source text editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works exactly like the first , except that at the same time the changes are both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is activated , this mode is already active , this mode activ@@ ates the active cursor from one window to another , while maintaining the position in the document .
the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be set up via Settings Qu@@ anta . after choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation can be set in addition to the interval . generally , the recommendation : a small gap for fast hosts and a large span for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so you can choose tools document properties . this allows the editing of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used to reduce the manual coding . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document yourself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . Met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword Key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of shaping the pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style sheet by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the use of the cursor is possible as in a word processor , by moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances the cursor will behave stran@@ gely . the mark works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and by using the back button or the distance button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way across the toolbar , as in the source text editor . it is to be noted that inser@@ ting tags before inser@@ ting tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , each other tag must be removed .
some tool@@ bars such as tables assistant or lists assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; work , in this release , the tables or lists toolbar buttons need to be used .
in contrast to other styles for style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style of the style sheet can be pursued .
in order to compile and compile successfully , the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml libraries still need lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db @-@ compatibility mode , the or@@ phan@@ ed holding points can be set in a particular file and line number and later activated .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without path name . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top@@ most loaded style file name with relative path to the con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g working folder . for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l loaded , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or complete match is checked with a template named QNAP or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template matches each QNAP that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; will be extended to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a sought @-@ after holding point must be terminated for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically performed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stopping points are re@@ checked shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

if a value is specified for the &quot; search@@ results sp@@ ath &quot; option , all output files will be stored in this folder . otherwise search@@ results folder will be processed by search@@ .x@@ s@@ l , using the option &quot; pre@@ ten@@ html &quot; will be used for search@@ s.@@ ps@@ .x@@ s@@ l .
if the command &quot; search &quot; is executed , a x@@ ml file called search@@ resul@@ ts@@ .x@@ ml will be created . this file can then be edited with a custom style sheet to present the data in another form , If the option &quot; prefer@@ html &quot; is not set , the file search@@ resul@@ t.@@ txt is displayed .

on systems with the installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can use the arrow keys to scroll through the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the previously executed commands .
multiple commands may require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass together expressions than one argument . &amp; eg ; : with the statement &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument , a holding point is set in a file called &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template that consists only of the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 and 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name like &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local file name on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or cy@@ g@@ win systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . other environment variables are allowed on R@@ IS@@ C @-@ OS systems .
path : a path to change the working folder . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; is replaced by the path to your personal folder .
data : the XML data or the XML _ Document that is processed by the style sheet . see &amp; lt ; FI@@ LE@@ NA@@ ME@@ Ms ; &amp; lt ; UR@@ I@@ gt ;
runtime commands : { bye _ BA@@ R _ exit _ BA@@ R _ quit } , step , step up , step down , next , continue , run , trace , set@@ option , options
there are many graphical tools for comparing . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I have written .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made a lot of changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts during mer@@ ging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed exactly within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to compare quickly text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and at the same time displays the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal , and the other one distinguishes itself in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both of them differ .
if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder ch@@ ub@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder
open dialog allows you to manually insert file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
through the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , for B and C a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the other folders .
when mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field becomes active for target and can be edited . however , it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file immediately . you can do this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting with the merge / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . you don &apos;t need to select any files in the Open dialog , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it across a comparison window .
what is the thought behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you would first have to create two corresponding files , they in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; load and then compare them . now you can copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop down of text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while over the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , one can see in the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files . this is to be seen in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) .
in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + , for example , white signs are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare cases . )
the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows . if the line break is enabled , the line is dotted with broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the title output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; when you have edited the result . usually , it contains already text by automatic mer@@ ging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons Spr@@ inge to the next solved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , any difference at the same time is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the group will be highlighted and the first line of the group will be shown . ) This group will then highlight the current group . it will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and on the left a black bar appears .
sometimes by automatic merge or manual editing no further line remains in the group ; then it is displayed in these lines of text &amp; lt ; no line in the queue ; displayed . this text appears neither in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you might copy and paste elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; conflicts of merge ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy this text from the result window . carefully proceed with this function .
note : when selecting the sources to ignore the options numbers or ignore ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated as white characters .
navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page on , page , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ Start and C@@ trl @-@ End , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the output window , you can also use the other keys to edit . by inser@@ ting -@@ key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insertion mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the sum@@ m@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as explained in the Con@@ version and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ trl @-@ image up@@ stream / C@@ trl @-@ image off ) or to the next / previous conflict .
to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ Pa@@ ste ) . if this option is checked , whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clip@@ board and the manual copy is om@@ itted . be careful with this option , because you could accidentally over@@ write the clip@@ board contents .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use carriage return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ diffusion keeps the line ends of the source files so you should not use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of last used files will be saved automatically when loading and restored at the next start . ( setup Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diffusion ... )
select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences will be displayed in itali@@ c script . if the selected font doesn &apos;t support this display , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered ast@@ ert .
if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
when you press Enter or Return , the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is checked , each selection will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board . the manual copy to the clip@@ board will be om@@ itted .
you can select which line end type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white marks can be ignored . the second step does not ignore each line . in this step white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , while others save only a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . however , if this option is checked , the back @-@ up characters will be visible , but like a white character . during mer@@ ging , this option must be disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complex and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in automatic mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before jumping on to the next un@@ resolved conflict .
this is useful when white marks are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , then use better the Cho@@ ose A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated .
these options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . see documentation for directory comparison and mer@@ ging for details .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version will be attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further f@@ use .
adapt the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you must &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart to make the change active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language there is set globally over the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set for each entry separately . if you enable this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
a short notice of what the local encoding is on the selection fields for the encoding . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
customize the file encoding for source files . this will affect how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually configurable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding to be used to save .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they may not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the default command can only be used with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
disable this in order to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files will be displayed . however , sometimes you just want to see the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; c ; C will appear next to the normal still a second over@@ sight column with the required information .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply stop the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click will merge the merge and use the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as pres@@ et name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last file used will be retained . )
when reading a file it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that exactly matches your requirements . you can use this function , for example , to cut off annoying parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first passed on to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command has also been specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only in line sequence . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that matches exactly your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user greater flexibility when setting up the diff results . however , an external program is needed and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is sufficient .

while you experiment with sed , you may begin to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diffusion . but it is good as an example for a further pre @-@ processing command for line equi@@ val@@ . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform several replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . for example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for displaying and mer@@ ging . other operations will only change the data that the line @-@ comparison algorithm sees .
note : in rare cases if you are using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre @-@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre @-@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences you may inad@@ vert@@ ently detect certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the suggestion before the start ,
... can simulate co@@ hesi@@ on and display the simul@@ ated changes without actually performing it ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the File dialog .
when three folders are merged , Fol@@ ner@@ 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder has been specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Fol@@ ner@@ 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details will follow . )
while reading the folders , a small message window informs about current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that were compared to that point will be listed .
when scanning the folder is finished shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the + / - click on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions : fold out all sub@@ directories and fold up all sub@@ directories with which you can open or fold the folders .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the comparison window will be started and a comparison window will appear .
the icon in the Name column reflects the type of file in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the Details Pan@@ e to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge action is started , you will be informed again about problems of this type .
as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
for identical entries , however , the color is identical even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then also folders have the same color . with folders , the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green , then yellow and later , when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the Synchron@@ ize mode is active when only two folders and no explicit destination folder have been specified , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action so that afterwards both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and select new file instead of mer@@ ging ( un@@ safe ) enabled , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the same date , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .. Whi@@ le such errors are not eliminated , the mer@@ ging of the folders cannot be started .
while mer@@ ging , one file will be executed after another . you &apos;ll be finished when mer@@ ging is successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected occurred . if mer@@ ging is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if in the Setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis , K@@ diffusion will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you do not specify a destination folder then it will be used as the target in the three folder mer@@ ging mode . B will be chosen as the target in the two folder mer@@ ging mode , and A and / or B will be used as the destination when synchron@@ izing .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder should also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory mer@@ ging / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to merge only the current record , select Action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if the conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid mer@@ ging actions , a message appears that indicates the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options passing , simul@@ ating and breaking .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select / continue / continue the directory merge , or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , an appropriate dialog will appear . then proceed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work will continue with the next entry .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; encountered on an error , a message appears and detailed status information appears . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for the entry , or solve the problem in another way before proceeding with mer@@ ging .
if some entries have been merged individually , these entries ( in the current session ) will not go together again . even if mer@@ ging has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; K@@ diffusion ... ) has now a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the given pattern are displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would be ignored by CVS too . many self @-@ program@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder specific can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hidden attribute . in other file systems , a previous dot will mark a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree or not . this option is turned on in default .
when the option is turned on , symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
when the option is turned on , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that if the option is enabled , a link to a folder containing a link on itself would lead to an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes down . ) This option is disabled in default .
the full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain any text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it might be faster to compare just the modification date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security .
similar to the change date . no real comparison takes place . the files are considered identical if they are equal . this can , for example , be useful when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is disabled in default .
enables syn@@ cing when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected in such a way that afterwards both folders are identical . also , the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging , the copy of the newer file will be suggested as an action . ( this is considered un@@ safe because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version will be renamed and will get the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of individual files , not only the mer@@ ging of entire folders . this option is turned on in default .
normally , the folder mer@@ ging view remains visible during the merge of individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want it , you can switch the Fol@@ der &amp; Text window option to switch off main window in the Windows menu and switch between the two views by alternating between directory and text window .
you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder mer@@ ging . as soon as you save the result , the status will be deleted and the file will not be re@@ merged once you start the folder mer@@ ging .
however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diffusion uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , esp@@ . &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes using the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it can &apos;t be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then one file will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permissions or change date . therefore , the permissions or change date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ dence of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ diffusion , press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select In K@@ diffusion 3@@ Part displayed from the context menu .
normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is applied as part , assumes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then boot &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click a patch file and select Pre@@ view in - K@@ diffusion Part . note that this does not work if no of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; executed as part , it supports only comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in Part mode .
there are already tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diffusion . in addition , the name K@@ diffusion has already indicated that it can merge like the diff@@ 3 program from the diff tool collection .
I &apos;ve been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and have learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all program@@ mers who have gone this path or want to go that way .
you compiled the program from sources and probably not informed the configure script to K@@ DE . in default configure installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical .
the editor re@@ members for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra one own file format that could store this information .
the effort required for this has so far been too large . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c has been defeated ; appeared and the text can &apos;t be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ diffusion on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of recent changes under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de , use the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir specifies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
as &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have problems when comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of them .
cut ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Remove ) copy to the clip@@ board and delete the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) add the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position or replace the current selection .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . )
this also leads to the fact that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when mer@@ ging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they will be missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) , they will be removed when clicking on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on work surfaces , change their size , quit or move them . this works both inside a desktop as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on desktop and at others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop as well as on other working surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager set up ... and exit . if , however , click on an application inside of &amp; p@@ ager , the context menu will also appear and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize , maximize , On Desktop and Finish . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working surfaces .
when this field is checked , the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
cross this field lets the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is crossed together with name , the names are provided with Ord@@ inary Num@@ bers , &amp; eg ; 1st Desktop .
when this field is checked , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the field .
when this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the window . otherwise , only empty spaces will be displayed to enable them to be selected .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple shows simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with their default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally let &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N pattern , all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops appear in a horizontal and vertical line in a vertical row , which is very well suited for viewing later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with their contents . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
click the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then select sel@@ ector switch ... allows the dialog Settings to appear .
at the moment this can &apos;t be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vice versa . if you do not have any write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or log into your system administrator .
da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you need a functioning installation of the basic K@@ DE @-@ packages .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use with &amp; k@@ mag ; a part of the screen as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance machines .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as the drop @-@ down window below .
in the default setting , &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mo@@ ve@@ able magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag ; cause a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( select window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse cursor to be displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse poin@@ ter . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ M@@ ouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use it , you can move the selection box .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
starts / stops the ad update . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , High , Very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a select window will appear . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( using the button document again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlar@@ ging and reduction &amp; etc ; .
also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can magni@@ fier and magni@@ fier ; to use one area of the screen , as if you look at the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click once the mouse cursor per@@ si@@ sts for a while at the same location . it is intended to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and causing pain for every mouse click .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click once the mouse cursor per@@ si@@ sts for a while at the same location . it is intended to help people who suffer from the repe@@ ating Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate the dra@@ gging with the mouse . this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can b@@ ypass the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , due to the mere moving of the mouse , pain may also be caused . if you suffer from pain related to using your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done .
to make it clear even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic relief devices , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and exec@@ utes a mouse click once you break the motion briefly .
moving the mouse , it wa@@ its until the end of the movement , before releasing the mouse button is executed . in this way , you can execute dra@@ gging with pressed mouse button . this allows you to drag the dra@@ gging with pressed mouse button . the intelligent moving requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool .
when Intelligent Rel@@ oc@@ ation is enabled , the shooting time is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button wait , before releasing the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse happens in the meantime .
this movement is stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time it is started , but can be changed later .
when the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select there sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer , which you can set to a lower value to shor@@ ten response times .
when this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; available . for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to launch a program automatically .
reset all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the user , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last pressing of the user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first of all with the pres@@ ets . in particular , you should leave the smart move off . if you have got used to the automatic mouse click , you can later accept the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; with sounds .
first of all , you should be aware at which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window , which do not represent a link , does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
if your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick in doing so is that you do not just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you need to take the mouse ball out . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear quickly when you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can easily scra@@ pe the dirt and dirt with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the intelligent moving , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can perform a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and move the cursor to another location .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor where you want it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to have it . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the toolbar and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent moving , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics .
intelligent shifting is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very likely to mark text , copy it to clip@@ board , or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button .
don &apos;t use the smart move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; select text instead : run a mouse click at one end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this is repeated every time you click &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . later you can use the intelligent moving without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some practice .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed . this should already be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter per@@ si@@ sts . this program has been developed for people suffering from the R@@ SI syndrome and causing pain to those of the mouse buttons .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to have a certain time waiting for a pulling process to begin before releasing the mouse button . this way , drag and drop can be done with the mouse .

&amp; Por@@ ts@@ mouth ; is a program that allows dum@@ b users to let their computers speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation course sentences that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . see the description of the setup dialog for more details .
on the second page , select the default text pass@@ book . you can often choose text passages from the text passages , without having to type them . of course , the text passages can be edited .
on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) you determine the dictionary of Wor@@ ds . &amp; Por@@ ts@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language in order to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ Dic@@ tionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are included in Wor@@ ds .
the main window of Mon@@ mouth is clear and essentially contains an input field for the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a movement memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have correctly set up , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken set is attached to the default memory . you can select sets that should be spoken again .
with the menu item Settings &apos;@@ Por@@ ts@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; Por@@ ts@@ mouth ; This dialog contains two card cards , voice output and settings , the Wor@@ ds page as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
enter the command to call the voice generator in the input field of the voice output . in the selection box under the input field , enter the character encoding with which text is passed on to the voice generator .
&amp; Por@@ ts@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text should be passed on to the voice generator as the default input .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your speech generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
if that is successful , the further settings on this page will be ignored . if that is successful , the further settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ u language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ äm@@ on , der &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Applications a standardized interface for voice output is available and that is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is meaningful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the Text passage book or in the bar for text passages .
with the selection of Instant , the selected text passage is directly spoken and additionally inserted into the course memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is first entered only into the input field .
the second selective field closing the edit window for text pass@@ book allows you to determine if the text passive book should be saved automatically when the editing window is closed .
with the selection of text passages , the book is saved . if you choose to reject changes , the text pass@@ book will not be saved . select Before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book should be saved .
the Wor@@ ds page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box you can choose the currently used dictionary for wor@@ d@@ ling .
with the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and select the language for the dictionary .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; Por@@ ts@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of single words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ Dic@@ tionary to insert only really written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are summari@@ zed and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without any entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; automatically inserts new@@ found words into the dictionary , generate a dictionary with your vocabulary through time .
the main area of the window to edit text passages is split into two . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the bottom part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
you can either add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either via the selection in the menu bar , toolbar , or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; alt key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected parts of the tape memory .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected parts of the tape memory .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sets of the delay memory .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the toolbar is located directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the smart left hand side and dra@@ gging the toolbar can be moved to another location .
when this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with clu@@ es about the status of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar for text passages with entries is displayed . by default , the bar is placed directly below the toolbar , by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and dra@@ gging the toolbar can be moved to another location .
you probably haven &apos;t entered the command for voice output properly or not fully . open Settings c@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the tab card voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
Festival is a language edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command for voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ eton folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following three command examples :
for the third example , the option should be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to swal@@ low up the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . the complete command is therefore more complex than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as standard input must be enabled .
the voice output da@@ emon of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; - further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the voice generator setting is only done in the K@@ TT@@ D , you only have to use dict@@ at@@ d as a voice service in &amp; Por@@ ts@@ mouth ; adjust .
for setting , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Ex@@ ample dialog of &amp; Por@@ ts@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to successfully use , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends in detail from your computer and its configuration .
&amp; Por@@ ts@@ mouth ; is an application that allows people who cannot talk , print text through the calcul@@ ator . a list of already spoken phrases is stored , which the user can always re@@ write .
note that there is no voice syn@@ thesizer . on the computer you have to install a voice syn@@ thesizer .

click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages .
the card orders are displayed only when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ Resol@@ ve , click on the General tab and tick the voice output button ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can preview the text of the displayed web page . then check the text that should be read , and select Tools in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre@@ amps and other un@@ seen marks are also read .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended text editor by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can pre @-@ read the displayed text . then check the text that should be read , and select the text to read in the main menu . then the speech output should start .
this also works if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ No@@ tify is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , which noti@@ fies you about events you have specified . you can also read the text of these messages by &amp; t@@ ts ; read them .
in &amp; convers@@ ational ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages ; for example , set up that you are notified when a message occurs in an I@@ RC channel , where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ No@@ tify , a menu entry will appear in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ NO@@ TE differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; belongs , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since this can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is edited before being sent to speech disp@@ at@@ cher &apos;s program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to replace mis@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent specific short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other applications and stops them . if the output of the screen reader is read , the stopped jobs are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after issuing the warning .
messages have the next highest priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; Por@@ ts@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that sends messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text read on a web page , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also news . read more .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you send from the card card orders is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of an application that uses text jobs . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts which do not have any particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es except for Screen Re@@ aders . when an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such preview , this output is stopped and terminated .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text assignments as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there can be even more types of filters .
plac@@ eholder Re@@ plac@@ ements replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . it is delivered with predefined string player filters , which allow the creation of chat emo@@ ti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for re@@ format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert and XML ; from a format to another format . included in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ML .
with speech selection filters you can send orders to a speaker depending on the content of the text or depending on the program sent by the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . if you have set a female voice on the card board speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . read about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it will continue the text unchanged to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts is sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page . processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters set up . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and will not be used . filters are executed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and you will see the next setup di@@ alogs below .
for the establishment of string substitute filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the corresponding substitute text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name in any way , it just has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column matching and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is executed in the order shown from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be used if the speaker for the text order speaks one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ trl key at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID of running programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers have to be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you may only type copy .
the string replacement filter is applied only to the text , if all conditions with an entry in the box do apply filters when matching . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. so the words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides .
but if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package ambig@@ u@@ ls .
X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such trans@@ formations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c suff@@ ices .
with the speaker selection filter you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card board , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can , for example , specify that texts from k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; passes a text to the filter , it searches for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker properties that the program sets the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the characteristics of the speaker set up on the card board . with the speaker selection filter you can over@@ write the chosen speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can click on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected to meet the desired requirements . click the button on the right to view the speaker selection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your speech preferences or to delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filtering if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ D over &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ 2.0 module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ D , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API from &amp; k@@ de ; The complete documentation for both APIs is available on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ Interface by &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ u program on the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text for reading and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , enter
open two &amp; console ; window . first launch kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ m@@ gr@@ in on the other .
none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ converter filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read pre @-@ read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able works at all . you must also do this yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also , make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation characters seem to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ewing cat@@ fish is spent . what can I do about it ?
first , make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be corrected by a string replacement filter .

American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ il@@ i , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ Bio .
K@@ T@@ TS also works with any voice syn@@ thesizer that can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information which are not yet included in this manual .
speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to extend &amp; t@@ ts ; for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used to support SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile , you need a recent development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) , including packages of k@@ deli@@ b and development files for the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program .
if you have the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ away or downloaded the tar@@ ball currently created every night , compile and install the program using the following commands :
before you use &amp; t@@ ts ; first check whether speech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of speech @-@ schedul@@ er ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can go back punc@@ tu@@ ation or paragraph , let repeat , pause or cancel the output .
for example , if you have set up a speaker , whose language English and its gender is female , this will be used , otherwise the most suitable speaker will be selected automatically . if you want to learn more about how &amp; Proc@@ t@@ ts ; a speaker will select , you will see in .
if you click Add Spe@@ aker on the tab and then insert a speaker into the list or click Edit , the card@@ holder set @-@ up is displayed . for example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . for details on the modules , please refer to .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PAT@@ H you only have to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text that will be passed to festival . in case of voices known &amp; kt@@ ts , this setting will be done automatically . generally , Western languages can use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak ( ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 ) .
with these sli@@ ders you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a few regul@@ ators and this gray will be displayed , the voice you choose does not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds because of their size . if you select this check box , these voices are loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ LED , so that the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster ( with greater memory consumption ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to click Apply ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the icon kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr can be seen in the system segment , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not yet run , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ LED reads a text . this gives you the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control it .
here all orders are performed in queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the precisely mach@@ ined set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card holder .
with buttons in this series you can move forward or backward in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on the OK button all changes to the settings ( also on the other card cards ) will be taken and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system segment . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de , click on the audio card . see also .
here only text jobs are performed and managed . screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . read more about the message types by &amp; kt@@ ts ; see in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has been &amp; t@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can not load the required libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are shown in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have chosen AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speaking speed here . 50@@ 6 ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ 00 ; % about double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the running &amp; Desktop ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you will need to find out which device works with you . in case of doubt , select Def@@ ault .
on this tab you can set up special actions , which are always executed if the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other applications and stops them . after reading the screen reader , the received orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; Por@@ ts@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that sends messages . if you have just read a long text on a website , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room .
if a text message is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , it adds &amp; t@@ ts ; the audio output to queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are only valid for normal text assignments . there are no special actions for messages , warnings and the expenses of screen readers if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; read K@@ No@@ tify messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click No@@ ti@@ fications . the card noti@@ fications appear .
select this check box to turn on &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications . if this setting is not checked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
when this setting is selected , al@@ erts when a sound is played are dict@@ ated by &amp; t@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sends if someone mentioned in an I@@ RC message your nick@@ name .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use this drop @-@ down sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts to do ; if an event occurs , you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the characteristics of the speaker you want . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is shown as the top entry in the list on the tab card .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the event All messages for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . to do so , you can set the al@@ erts as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the messages in a file . use the Load button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All noti@@ fications will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , voice speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also , brands for controlling the pron@@ unciation of for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; Proc@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations exist :
you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British Male ) because this is the standard voice that is used in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds can start reading text into individual sentences . this allows you to quickly start reading or stop the first set , since only the first set has to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this directly .
at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set @-@ level detection filter is automatically set up as a default . you can change its settings or add further punc@@ ture detection filters , but beginners will not be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn is to select the speaker selection by trying out . turn off the speaker selection and select text to read . switch on the choice of speakers , change some properties and check how the choice of the speaker is changed . of course , you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter will be in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then start faster with reading , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function , you can pause or cancel text messages on the card card .
for these reasons , the normal punc@@ ture detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set Level detection Fil@@ ters match text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional ends and insert a tab character ( Dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard pro@@ posi@@ tional label filter keeps the punc@@ tu@@ ation .
S@@ BD filters will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( notify ) , warning messages , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the standard set identi@@ fier from default , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
on the card selection card you can over@@ write the speaker settings for the application . the card card will be displayed if
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card holder ) . in other words : no microphone properties are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker , which has all the features of a speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; select this speaker . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that best matches the originally set properties .
select the method to enter the desired speech characteristics by clicking on one of the buttons .
select here the characteristics of the speaker you want . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , enter nothing .
select this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set multiple flags here .
since language is a critical factor in the issue of output , it is always treated as a primary feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is available if you know that a particular application will be sent text in a different language than the default language in the working environment .
to delete all the features in the speaker area , the most likely to delete the following , click the Def@@ ault Monitor button and then use the speaker which is most likely to follow .
in this case , 0 stands for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crashes immediately when it starts . I have compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I do not get traceability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashing and running ; you probably have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved by G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x , a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I stop a text application , it freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the console , a message appears that says : un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
on your system , there is a problem that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have invited an additional voice for festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t show that voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / Vo@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / Vo@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / Vo@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / Vo@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / Vo@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / Vo@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / Vo@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / Vo@@ ices . if that &apos;s successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able by the environment variable PAT@@ H . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer module such as Festival Interactive offers a setting for speed even on the card board for speaker system . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active .
( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ converter filter , and set up the speaking speed .
I don &apos;t manage websites being read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival or@@ ator , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the Tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that festival does not produce errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER tags to convert from SS@@ ML to S@@ aber . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a custom character set filter and now I can go to &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more set @-@ up or go back . on the tab orders is displayed , the job consists only of one set . what do I do wrong ?
you must not filter punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) instead . use a filter for punc@@ ture detection instead .
Al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer by using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts , using the command follow @-@ register . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ escal@@ top@@ .org )
some users experience conflicts with AL@@ SA in audio output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t simultaneously play music and read a text . it also freezes if you stop a text application and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; t@@ ts , the current sentence will be read in advance .
the audio program so@@ x is used for general voice speed setting , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x using the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs .
if you have downloaded &amp; t@@ ts ; downloaded as tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , log in as a normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder .
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 , the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
the following modules for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a runtime @-@ dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( not @-@ free according to the Deb@@ ian distribution guidelines ) . the configure option for switching the display shows the configure parameter which causes the creation of the creation .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you will need to install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions supplied with festival . if you want to read web pages , you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses 1.@@ 95 beta or new . the voice is still in an early stage of development . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone for the voices . select a ky@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , look for the festival on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the r@@ ussi@@ an voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ l@@ lic as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; syn@@ thesizer . then , Festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete language delivery system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival creates this from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create from German texts di@@ phone .
in this process , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / .
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either Festival Version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival of

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .dll ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .dll ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after the installation a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .dll ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network Network Settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; start .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .dll ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to enable &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .dll to display the device at all and allow the setting of the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and set up when installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the Network Settings option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Index . when the module is started , it tries to automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which corresponds to the distribution and the Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by selecting the setting non @-@ re @-@ questions the definition can be hit permanently .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode , click the system administration mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tabs :
the network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be carried out by the rider network interfaces :
the Network interfaces displayed on display can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button ... in the Device Dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options .
the automatic mode sel@@ ects TCP / IP settings from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out at the same time with the start of system services . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information on every system start , so no further setting is required .
the manual can be used without dh@@ c@@ p or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the IP address input field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is checked , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are shown as the properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address on the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the network console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be enabled or disabled according to requirements . switching on an switched off network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ...
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on your needs . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
specifies the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net , which communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used as standard for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer asks ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org then DNS will resolve this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be placed in the list by selecting an entry and adding or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the Hin@@ ts or Her@@ man buttons .
by clicking the Add button ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . the Add New Name Server dialog will be displayed .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click on the Edit button .... This will display the Edit dialog .
the list of names known by name describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting , if no DNS servers are available . in small , remote networks , it can replace DNS servers .
usually the list of names in particular contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv@@ 6 addresses support . this still in the test version of IP should replace version 4 in future .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ as dialog will appear .
enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the known host has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the alias names .
select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit .... The dialog known Calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ con@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installing binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a software console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used .
in this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not only , but also the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and compile the following commands .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , and in the second , all of the configuration files changed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .dll may be discussed .
this section does not replace any further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about integrating the PC into a small ( home ) network is provided .
currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 4 has never found any big dis@@ semination . IPv@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . therefore , this description is currently focuss@@ ing on the widespread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned . in external networks , at &amp; eg ; Work@@ place , the network administrator is the point of contact to assign a valid IP address or , if available , DH@@ CP can be used .
when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks of up to 250 hosts .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all computers are participants in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 27 ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is required for IP forwarding .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
in this part you will find the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .dll and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed in DSL connections so it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections there is another content to be found there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another stand than expected can occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which furthermore provided the capability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packing .
before a tape can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat . this can happen in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; train the tape back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the band . recognize &amp; k@@ dat , the pre @-@ tension@@ er on the tape does not , you will be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
detects &amp; k@@ dat , the header , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if this is not found , you will be asked if the band index should be recre@@ ated .
if everything goes smooth the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been mounted . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by un@@ folding the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; gives a change to the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and shows in the status bar a corresponding message . the band can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a band can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a tape drive must be format@@ ted before you can use it to store data . if your tape drive requires format@@ ting of tape before use , it must happen before you can format the tape before use . floppy disk drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape , while DA@@ T drives are not format@@ ted .
after entering the band name and capacity , continues &amp; k@@ dat with the format@@ ting of the tape . all data on the tape is lost thereby ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only save this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup has been started , the Settings dialog opens . in this dialog you can check the selected files again and change the backup settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you confirm the settings , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Backup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including data rate and time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu item Check ....
once the test procedure is started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the working folder for verification .
if you confirm the verification settings , the dialog appears to check . this dialog displays the progress of the review process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can re@@ connect , the files to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive entry . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rec@@ over in the menu ....
once the restore process is started , the Settings dialog appears for recovery . in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the working folder for recovery .
if you confirm the restore settings , the dialog will pop up . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file using the tape contents . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index in two ways :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the currently selected folder .
for all folders listed in backup files , only the files in it are backed up on the same fil@@ esystem as the folder . folders located on other file systems can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independently of the others .
performing an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings in the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to device file for tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat , before the tape is mounted the command mt load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat , to lock the ej@@ ector at the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , the tape is automatically dis@@ connected ; the tape is automatically ej@@ ected . do not use this option on flo@@ pp@@ ies .
if the option is on , try &amp; k@@ dat , to change the hardware side block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must inform &amp; k@@ dat , in any case the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat , a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape .
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , with the host@@ name being the full name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time in which the band was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup band . this icon is only active when a tape is mounted .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information on problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ System@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer makes in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified display of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can quickly access information about problems that arise on their server . &amp; k@@ System@@ log ; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ System@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , provides &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; k@@ system log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - to open . if you do not see it , and it opens up instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ System@@ log ; most likely do not have access to system administrator rights . the protocol files usually find themselves under Linux in the folder / var / log , for which normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or by entering strings . in the default setting , the list box next to the filter will show the entry All . then a log line will only be displayed if a string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns .
you can of course also select another entry at this point . for example , the string of the filter search term will only be matched with entries in the selected column . for example , in the log file system log , select the name of a process , then show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log rows sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more noticeable color as protocol lines of level hint . the colored representation of protocol lines can be disabled settings dialog .
if you want to display only certain process ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the launch of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the main window context menu , in order to display all new log rows that are added .
to use this feature , use the entries in the Windows menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ System@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more up @-@ to @-@ date information on the Sour@@ ces of &amp; k@@ System@@ log ; .

welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named so ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
system V In@@ it quickly became the standard for the control of program start @-@ up when running the system in the &amp; Linux ; this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it bin@@ aries is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine on System V In@@ it without installing a new installation and re@@ format@@ ting . therefore , you must make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . There you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ s@@ it and the following other folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for each system service you want to start when running the system or switching to another run level . system services do not include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls are according to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file even if there is not much use for it . you can also set a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel sel@@ ects in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one it finds .
the default Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . in the beginning , you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab manually and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up something together , you can fix it by restart the system and run the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script will be inv@@ oked with the stop argument . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument boot argument .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server running level that can only run ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user -@@ run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other pointing device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it at this level ( or to stop it ) .
you can also move the script between Run@@ nig or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . this will only be removed from its original run@@ level ( or position ) . this will only happen if they pull out an entry in the field of available system services .
note : entries are moved when you move them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new Run@@ level , you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the contex@@ tual menu and paste them into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sor@@ ter number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sor@@ ter numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different work ranges ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it into the clip@@ board by cutting it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired Run@@ level with past@@ ing ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to manually change the sort number or name of an entry , press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to preferences are saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ eg@@ s and now the machine is constantly starting new . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simplifies the configuration for the proprietary implementation programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not conform to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check that all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service ( and whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) just quit without notice , if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level to allow it to be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter custom@@ ization of &amp; k@@ user .
after you have made changes you have to save it . either use the corresponding toolbar icon or the Save In menu item .
the main window consists of two tabs , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group by double @-@ clicking on the entry . it appears the user and group properties dialog .
some maps will only be displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have configured space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a map will be created where you can customize individual settings . if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the password management card will appear in the case of Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD domains .
this card only appears if , for at least one fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here parameters can be changed for each user , with the space limitations of each file in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected using the File System field with space limitation
the tabs group informs about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the field Prim@@ ur Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar . edit or delete the selected user or group works an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO Selec@@ tor , add , remove and change boot password , change time to boot of the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more .
