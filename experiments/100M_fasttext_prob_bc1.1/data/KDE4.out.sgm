<seg id="2">If part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated into place of the whole & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Automatic translation is only very rudimentary. babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make important decisions dependent, without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages can be translated. other texts should be translated by yourself on the Babelfish page, where you can paste texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains different modules for & konqueror;. despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions by & konqueror; by making them easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual on & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, choose settings extensions... Open the card tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard installation modules from the kde paddons package. please note that there are more modules on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & konqueror; on Extras cancel. then you can view the page that caused & konqueror; to crash, or the list of crashes, if present, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Module Angle Filter (also called Folder Filters) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Tools View filters. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use DOM tree view in & konqueror; select Tools to view DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display starts with the root node of the document, for example: documentElement, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides a further view of objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different toolbar and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tree-Maps allow representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the child objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder defining the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. in this way, large files can be easily recognized even if they are far below in the folder hierarchy. therefore & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap listing a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and caption settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over View color mode can either provide depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the image of another file property such as name, owner, group, or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space for the representation or whether the area of sub-rectangles should be used. furthermore, you can set the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">With Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always complied with. boxes are drawn to represent the nesting of entries, and those boxes need space that is then no longer available to subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As division of the area of an entry is done for the subordinate entries, the implementation is left to the implementation. in this case, it is necessary to divide the areas in such a way that rectangles are formed, which are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are lines, columns or recursive split.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum displayed area for an entry via the menu entry View Angle at Area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget developed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The picture gallery module can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras View picture gallery... or using Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you access the Picture Gallery module, a dialog opens which allows you to specify the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Picture per line option has a slider and a rotation field to set the number of mini pictures of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">With the Analog field File name of the image, specify whether the filenames will be displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the checkbox file size of the image, specify whether the file size is displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the image size check box, you specify whether the image size is displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the Folder dialog, specify where the gallery is stored and which subfolders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Save In HTML file, enter where the HTML page is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the Subfolders check box, you can set up with a slider or rotation field, up to which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Use the check box to copy original pictures to see if the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Using the check box comment file, you can specify a comment file for caption of images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">You can specify a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; Settings provides you with easy access to the general & HTML; -Settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behaviour of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the & konqueror; Display menu under the navigation pane window, or using the shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click in the navigation pane of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser recognition adds a menu entry in & konqueror; in addition, you can change browser and operating system identifiers for individual domains. this is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser recognition of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that refuses access with this browser, change browser recognition in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the password in MSIE for sites that reject access with browsers on the base of Mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browser recognition to access the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - elements and attributes are correctly represented by the identifier of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the set browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the Configuration menu entry... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; -module check your & CSS; style sheets and & HTML; -documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3C and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">You can check the module website in the & konqueror; check menu under Tools Website. you can check the following tests:</seg>
<seg id="48">With the & HTML; check if your & HTML; -Document of the syntax of & HTML; corresponding to all found errors will be displayed. with this check, you can make sure that your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Allows you to check your & CSS; style sheets that are included in a & HTML; - or & XHTML; -Document. with valid & CSS, your web pages have a uniform appearance regardless of the browser used.</seg>
<seg id="50">Checks the links on your site on forwarding instructions and incorrect links. recursively all links on the website are checked.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here you can set the addresses of the server for checking your & HTML; -documents and & CSS; style sheets.</seg>
<seg id="52">With the module Web-Archiving for & konqueror; you can save web pages with text and images in .html format.</seg>
<seg id="53">Click on Tools to archive the website and a dialog will appear to save the displayed web page.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface will be provided to you to connect to your digital camera and your photos directly to & digikam; albums can download. of course, each medium and card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digicam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digikam; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. editing capabilities can easily be expanded with KDE Image Plugins Interface (Manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although digitised; easy to use, there are dozens of professional capabilities available. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; via camera or lens to search for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also digitized; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. you should therefore report problems and opportunities for improvement.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digikam; tries to report problems or suggestions for improvement as easily as possible. wherever you are in the program, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system. all required information is already registered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. i.e., the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to ask you to answer questions from other users. in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicode; homepage to learn news about released versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate in & edited; registration is in the developer mailing list. instructions for registering in the Developer mailing list by & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">Once you start editing, you will be prompted where you want to save your images and your database. simply enter a local, remote, or removable folder. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data collection is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & Edit; will also use as an Albenbibliothek in addition.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder. & Edit; considers each subfolder as an album.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; needs recursively recursively the library path in its full depth. you cannot exclude subfolders unless it iste in hidden folder. this allows you to insert special files by inserting a point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenites do not have any pictures as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and putting it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up & edit your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Cue List to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Support is based on the libraid library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help raw amerasupport.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh decoder settings and raw workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface will be provided to you to connect to your digital camera and your photos directly to & digikam; albums can download. of course, each medium and card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digicam; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash, memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digikam; uses the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital camera. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are big files and transfers via the serial port are slow, this connection is now deprecated. & Edit; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that digicam images can be read reliably. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you may not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the nicest things in & digikam; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, Kphotoalbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can also be a user. your advantage is that it is much simpler, & Edit; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in & dialog; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; or switch to full screen mode using F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop images all over: you can place an image in a different part of the Albenediel, above the horizontal dividing line or in another application window. the only limitation is that one image cannot be stored in keywords, date lists or searches.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to save the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, raw, movies and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. so, the filter on the file name works only if this filter is also displayed in the symbol view. which fields are shown can be configured in the dialog of the alert settings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albensis & quot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all the photos that were saved by & digikam, are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were created on the hard drive, according to the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created. the date can be changed in the features of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have created a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album Import images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move a picture from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse onto the target album and drop it down. in the then appearing menu you have to choose whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move it to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to give information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and select album Properties from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos if you want to add or delete albums by collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: will be used if you sort your albums by date with View records sorted by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons Elders, average, New Year: these put the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or that of the average of the album. to do this, the average of the pictures will first try to calculate the EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first have an album in & digikam; open, the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albeni stequot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu & quot; As an album preview, choose. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports the input of keywords for single photos in the area My Keyword list on the bottom left of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images in this album will be displayed in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two loupe buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you need to wait for a moment while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this by using the Tools menu on the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image will be displayed below the preview. what information this is, you can change your profile via Settings. select the albums page and adjust the thumbnail area to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you leave the mouse cursor one moment over a picture, the help displays the most important features including all the tags of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photo editing displays your photos and allows you to organize a number of improvements to these. you can reach all the functions that have been edited with & Edit; you can reach all the functions that have been edited with & Edit; you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or editing the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image processing with a photo using either F4 image editing... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit... editing. in the Edit section, you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos. image editing allows you to view and edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">You can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the opening menu. for this, and how to customize it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs, there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image. this way, this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& Edit; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click the thumbnail to preview and rotate. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right click on the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. keep in mind that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a Photo from & Edit, it is moved to the trash bin of & kde; moved. F8 Photo Delete or Delete If you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift + Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My Datumslider quot; organizes your photos based on the data. & Edit; use either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last change of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keyword provide a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos and cataloguise. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo may be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all photos selected with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted into a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also collapse parts of the tree & quot; My Keyword Networks, so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. you can also use your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; My keyword quot; or on an existing keyword and then select new keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this will become the substituting of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword is removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and storing it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can only be in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and editing the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My Cue.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, select the picture with the right mouse button and select as Album preview in the context menu. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can happen in two ways: once you have chosen the photos you want to provide with a keyword, you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My cusp. alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select from the context menu keyword.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be shown as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way you can give a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event in which it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a picture with keywords, this will be shown under the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Remove from the Tags menu. the menu only shows you the keywords that were assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a time-dependent adjusted histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection box can be moved over this histogram. in order to select a timeframe, you only need to click on the bottom rectangle of the frame, which indicates the time unit. this will show all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. this will then appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all the elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more in the future.</seg>
<seg id="125">Incidentally, the search box is a small lamp that will be green if the search finds matches. if you click here, the filtering will be deleted and all images will be displayed again. if The Search has not found anything, then the lamp will be red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tabs on the left side bar with binoculars. if you open this, you can save a simple search box as described above. you can save this search here but as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press the head OK and the search will be performed. the results will be used in the View My search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after searching, you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When you select Edit Search, the search query form will appear again with the previously entered search information. if you select Edit As an advanced search, the Advanced search dialog will appear to change your previous search. see section The Advanced search tool for more information.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Search in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in specific fields by & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the AlbenDatabase. any option can be added to this list with search group / search group or deleted from it. any option can be associated with others about the logical operations All..., A..., No... or at least.... in addition, you can create search of type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterized each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond to it. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar items: this is an area where you can drop every picture to find a similar. by means of a Swellert, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture from somewhere over the icon of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and digiplug; find the matching pictures. also here a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Marble mini program. move it in or out with the mouse wheel or move it down and move it. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this assumes, of course, that your images contain Geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">You can specify a name for your geo filter in the field below. it will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geo folder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& Edit; provides a lamp in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files, together.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl + L. the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opens. if you are back in & edited; main window, you can quickly open the luminaire with L Extras.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images. if you navigate pairing from the toolbar, then the two first images will automatically be loaded into the compartments. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to see it on the left. this simplifies working through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal delete actions also work directly from the light table, e.g. F4 file Edit....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both preview images in the light table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom end of each area you will find a built-in pivot function, which you can recognize on the crossed arrows. in order to pivot the visible range of the image, you need to click on it and the & LMB; keep it pressed. in the preview mode both images will display the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zoom works just like in other views. just use the zoom slider under the images or ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out.</seg>
<seg id="145">Digital stock management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or stores digital photos leads a form of digital inventory management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips how to back up your images, find, protect and use photos again. we focus on the procedures for digital photographers that & digikam; use. we view the download, rename, remove, convert, classify, archive, optimize, maintain and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management adopts, indexes, categorizes, secures, seeks, transforms, confectioned and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is based on your definition data that provide information about or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you don't need to find a specific photo longer without inventory management. if you don't even know how many photos you have then you certainly don't use & digikam;. the approach to save the metadata in both a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. you must decide whether other access to your photos should have, whether you want to save it to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a larger disk at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">You may be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can quickly be found about your location unless you were in the same place several times in one year. if you have enough photos, then you will be able to use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; export is then a folder for images that you can print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, workflow, constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? separation of file types makes pile handling easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know whether you are looking for an original or derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend storing the metadata option in the Edit page in & dialog; enabling EXIF and IPTC data to be written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which edited? add a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are, of course, the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, as you should assign each photo to keywords, inscriptions and a rating. of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. you start the best with the rating or ranking. this makes sense, as you can focus on the best photos during further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's talk with keywords, keywords, as you frequently are called in other programs or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically set the tree for you or insert the images to the right place. the change of hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can be easily done by moving a sub-tree to another. the changed keywords are done by & digikam; updated while it tracks the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata overlap. this is a very rough representation because each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You just want to let no one see your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">From the distance is not even a nice panorama of the beach. if you look at it closer, then start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming to have associations, memories, the historical time period is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at your photos, the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you want to show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer, to help him understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug; you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as a lettering. if you export your images in web galleries, then these labels will be exported according to your wishes in the caption and / or the title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without navigation system? was it Earth not a boring planet off GoogleEarth? good, because with pictures the move of the spatial presentation now drives with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit geolocation are already innumerable and will become even deeper in the future. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually recreate your trips using images with geographic information. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a pun with copyright and describes the practice of using copyrights to remove restrictions on distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the setup page of & digikam, which should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the photographer's identity, then the name of a company or organization can be used. this field does not support commas or semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author): linked to the author. this field contains the photographer's job description. examples of this can be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for provider): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group / agency that offers the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">The solution to this problem is digital watermarks. for individuals, this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. digitised; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failure, disk failure, electrical surges, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, recovery, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, disseminated superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire. these types of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper or negatives. in this section we discuss problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery firm, has some interesting statistics, which causes a loss of data.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, they need to be handled carefully and you can't afford more than a couple of years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD disks can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and storing them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest ones, but you write a lot more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if you have just been written. therefore, they use a checksum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there's a cheap program called IsoBuster that seems to work miracles on CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from corrupted disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a Dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs, of course, also applies to Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Then read the media with a description, date & author and then store on a clean, dark dry and protected spot. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves. their manufacturers' warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this subject: disk study</seg>
<seg id="187">The failure rate is dramatic. electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason, SMART can not detect these errors. some errors identified by SMART herald the imminent failure. these are especially read errors and publishing counters. the expected life time is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course you can also have data loss due to a current loss before you have backed up the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices don't matter much, it looks different with computer chips and high-speed processors. these can cause severe damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause scratched keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs some of the energy jokes and grooves the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should be aware that it fulfils the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also take care that it provides protection against flash impact and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage contactors, which also provide a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem so that you are ideal for on the go.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore make sense to invest in an uninterrupted power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically recharge battery power when a power failure occurs. this gives you the ability to store your data and run down the system. if you purchase a UPS, you should be sure that they fulfill the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in case of electricity trouble with the cost to avoid this. a high quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it. finally, you should always remember to trash all the cables before you go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can mount it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer to store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">You are compared to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services rendered on photos. your free storage is limited to 1GB and you will not have your pictures available in full resolution online. for $25 a year you get unlimited storage, which should be checked in reality first.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the viewpoint of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and in the big companies is included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory. thus they are desastercertainty.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about it is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not if it happened in your hardware. all these disturbances stay undetected until one day you have to open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise. no one seems to have ever thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses since they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. you will see thousands of errors a year already in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates that can deal with disk failures on a lower level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux; and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its blowfs file system. this is still in the alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms used by ZFS and is also available for & Linux; but it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss on the notebook and 46% in the workstation systems. in case of laptops, the share of thefts amounts to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to lower damage, e.g. theft or new installations. and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFs and XFS to name the most popular file systems. find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file has not been stored completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft, and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings removed from fundamental physical boundaries. it is meant that while technology continues to develop, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel numbers. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deteriorates. a sensor size of 6 megapixel and high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so don't blame anybody for data loss. so, secure your data often after a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous like re-installing your operating system, replacing plates or resizing the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external SATA drive daily. if, then one day, a lightning strikes you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes and destroys a lot. forget aircraft deficit: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore desasterprevention always means a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs to the neighbour house, into your office or something similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as said above, there is a common cause for data loss, despite safeguarding the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot of two times: the complete backup and the last differential protection.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates several snapshots. you can restore the original state at any time on which such a backup has been made. this backup comes from a versioning system the next with the exception that is only sampled and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should happen manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, IPTC stored in the image file, retain original, memory, scalability, media, retrieval of images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., using the internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">In order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you need to look at everything today with caution and re-rate as time goes by. unfortunately, there is no other way to make a certain vigilance. the fewer variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the printout for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned scalability and have placed the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition. at * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this section and shift it onto a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new disk was detected by the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb, the new record is / dev / sdb, the new record is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdb / dev / sdb, resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of stimulus if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market, so you shouldn't use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color allocation on heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF needed and a slow compression. we would recommend this format to save your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). a problem is, however, that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG Digital Negative File Format is a royalty-free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and obligated to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers already provide DNG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource blogger; technology of the 90s. it is a labelling technology that allows users to embed their data into a file themselves. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers drag it before an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format, to archive. XMP fits in because it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it may cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file. therefore, you should consider if you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include the work on architecture and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in DCMI communities and DCMI teams, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a broad acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera screen, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them to your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For fine-layer editing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & Edit, then you should add the metadata again. these may be cut off from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them only then in web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & edited; to get a description on how to add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your AlbenDatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, connect them to the computer, turn the camera to the display mode and turn on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will appear. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol will be displayed on the camera for each file, photos, movies, music, etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metadata section displays the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as the editor's main window, or editing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of All. this loads all photos from their camera to a single album in & digikam;. when downloading, the photos will not be deleted and we recommend that you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can select only the desired selection methods by & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the download button and then download the selected one. the selected download button will be grayed until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New download is available. these images have not been downloaded yet by & digikam. in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you are using the All Download or Selected buttons, a dialog with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are placed. the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums tab. then select the target album from the list and click OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & Edit; load the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by using the Delete All Delete button. if you want to delete only some, you must select it first and then delete the deleted ones.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera. you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded into a digiplug; album downloaded before you want to delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera finder, you should do this via the camera menu, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The file names are usually reused after the photos were deleted from the camera. this can lead to double filenames in case you upload photos from different recording galleries into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to include the date and time when the image was taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for date-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The first two concern the data about the author in section Standard Car Identity. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the standard format, for example, in the editing area, you can use the prefix foto-% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filename, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters. or in uppercase if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, which is edited and edited; for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera will provide in the preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and automatically used when you next time you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digikam; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation while downloading. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar metadata you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is usually turned on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, it is digitized; the photo in its original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Advanced Button and select the Automatic rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken, you can use it to automatically create sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are downloaded in the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar Meta-data you can find out what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and digitised in this case; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn on this option. use the Advanced button and select the date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the button Download. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears in which you can select the files to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is finished, asks & Edit; you where the images should be uploaded. select a folder selection dialog for the camera. select here the desired folder and click OK to start the upload. images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position indicated in longitude and latitude grading and which can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be done by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environment planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can with a click open a browser that displays the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digicode; users who want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the image? first, you should know that exiv2 has many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitrailings and map references. the question is actually more, how the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical allocation (manual) and last on manual input of known locations.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few that work together with GPS receivers. either as card module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. you have to save this data in gpx format, since this is the only format supported by the geo-mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate data from images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same on & Linux; go to gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latileness or other data, you can use this script that works with the exifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the predefined coordinates, which are created for example by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European road maps. here are some European sites, at least French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digikam; try to give you so much control over its workflows as possible. there are many settings that have changed the behavior of & Edit. to access these settings, you must select Edit Settings; set up the settings dialog. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select Action can be set to preview or start image editing. so you set the default behavior of & Edit; specify when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written in the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">This field should include the photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the car field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for vendors: use this field to indicate who is offering the photo. this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here, then the group or agency that provides the image will be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC rims. this means that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the digicode database; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited in & edited; without getting lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image inscriptions as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos with the captions embedded in the images.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse pointer rests in the main window over a file. depending on the selected option, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; edited; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam; to display, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminaire by & digiplug; can be set on this page to the default values. however, each time you open the illuminated table these settings are switched on. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. the option & quot; In the whole image size, you should only use on fast machines. if you have one, then you can get better viewing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can disable the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bright color in the image. these colors are set here. in the image processing, this picture mode with F10 and F11 can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="296">With chroma subsampling, it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression option you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality, as PNG requires a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">Using the TIFF Compression option, you can compress the default compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no influence on image quality, since the default algorithm works without loss.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss-free JPEG 2000 files you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In earlier versions of & edited, image editing was only an image viewer for photos. currently, it quickly develops into a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor respond more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels in odd lines, this difference creates a lattice pattern in the output. this option draws the image a bit soft, but eliminates the 2x2 lattice patterns with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the Automatic Color Balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. default is to use a solid color balance, based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top lights, so the parts of your images that are burned, due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights, as passing white. finally, you can attempt to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general do not saturate as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option to Reconstrucause, you get the possibility to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & digikam; image processing. to keep the time for the demo-icing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo-icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the sub-raw data that comes from the color filtered image sensor, which has many cameras and which provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests, it looks as if AHD interpolation (for adaptive homogeneity Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for correction correction since it is carried out during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions on how to return it. there are also LCMS and & Contacts; information such as the color information from a color space to the other can be translated to make the colors as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in image editing / Color management module with raw files start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folder Sets the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC in which you all save your profiles. & Edit; then examine this folder during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have the option & quot; standard squot; to store your profiles. everything can be changed later when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your images color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera creator and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some such as Canon, which do not contain color mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw gamma does not correct for conversions at 16 bit depth.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the Soft-Proof profile that you can emulate as your image would be given back from a device. this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated, rather than relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for what it is intended for. unfortunately, not on the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is, of course, unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes the style for the goal: F for a precise style, L for landscape, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & kde; image viewers and image processing. by providing this interface, & digikam; many modules support which have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and these will be uploaded by & Edit; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and additionally you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The slide show settings should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes switch off the metadata that appears at the bottom of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show on the left side a list of all supported cameras. on the right-hand side there is a button automatic detection, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. below you find the port settings. currently there are serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom, you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field will only be active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, set it in the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">If not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it is displayed in the Cameras of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the trash can display the conversation of & digikam; when deleting a photo in an album, you can find further details in the sections deleting a photos and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editable changes through the right sidebar can be used in silence by & Edit; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without any queries. otherwise, you need to save the changes using the button Changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also include the display of the welcome screen by & digikam; when starting, this speeds up the starting process by & digikam;.</seg>

<seg id="337">& Edit; includes fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use it to view your photos and for correction and improvement. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selecting the item Display / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image editing includes a set of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & dialog; therefore, you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see Setting up the image processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file number, magnification factor, and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top, including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed features.</seg>
<seg id="341">Editing functions of image editing change your photos. however, none of the features will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You might need to make a copy of your image before you change it. you can do this with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you haven't saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Recover menu from the File menu or using the Restore button to restore image processing in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have done in the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually every action of image editing can be undone or restored. you can undo the last action by modifying or rebuilding edit by selecting restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, use the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to reconnect.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you select the & LMB; press a moment longer through the revert or restore button in the toolbar, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the editing process, you can move between the photos on the same album or keyword by clicking the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image, or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can zoom in and out in the picture using Ctrl; mouse wheel or icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select the magnification factor</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode. you get to the normal view in which you use the Esc key. if you do not want to do so, you can also edit this in the folder dialog by & digikam; Edit main window. see the section for setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the image in the File menu and get the standard & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or entire sentences. whole picture pages can be printed from your selection. you just have to select the images with the standard methods and select Export Controls from the menu Album. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The digiport; main window has a sidebar at the right, providing important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation arrows, even in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear into the edge again.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied into the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are converted. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user button, there is a button Learn more. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. however, this is always done when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and collations. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select this and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field of Regency. the code will follow the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword review displays a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree, and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this digitised session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is a further relief when entering keywords during a series of images. if you have entered different keywords, these will be saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the corresponding check boxes in the tree. keyword keyword contains all keywords for an image.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection, If you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please refer to the Keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar with their album, - date, keyword and search views are used. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and drop keywords. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and put it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the above example, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is based on No Keywords, which reduces the amount to three images, and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be disabled under Settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or it, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can, for example, set an advanced search on all the elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the grouping button. the options will then look like this:</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is the colors that come from your camera or scanner to have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web to those of your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the topic comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons they need to press for the results they want. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing workflows. in addition, you should make informed decisions on each point of image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you can obtain the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your picture workflow satisfies all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB color space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image editions are via e-mail or web, where sRGB is the de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one use another color space and thus have to worry about dyes?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to sound my monitor if I chose to work only in sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in sRGB colour space or not, you must sound your monitor, since sRGB is based on sRGB. if you work as the colour space of sRGB, you either need to calibrate your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, adjust, automatic balance and contrast expand from the menu Correcting Automatic correction try automatically out of your colors the best. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminous intensity over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest spot as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Balance: this method adjusts the intensity channel of the color of the selected image so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. sometimes the comparision has very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation, which causes either wonders in an image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic comparison: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and light bordertone colours and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram region.</seg>
<seg id="393">Extending contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible in the case of well-balanced images and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance by & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is somewhat limited because it works over a color space with 8 bits per color. if you can carry out the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction are better avoided.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side you can see both the original image as well as the preview of the target picture. the preview will dynamically adjust the tool's settings. if you want to see the original white balance, then it is enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photo has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above a histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your results depends on shade, saturation and gamma. the shade adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play with the above controls, use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result displayed in white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Load buttons make exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The default settings reset all filter values to their default values and neutral white balance. remember that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth for each color channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high quality images. however, this coding needs more disk space, calculation time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assigning color profiles. color mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to rate the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find tone correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time, so that you can always use it for several photos. this is useful if your camera or scanner always makes the same mistake and therefore always need the same correction. in the manual for sound correction you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure issues is the tool for gradation that you can find under color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The digiplug; tool color effects provide you with four color effects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation was also called sabatier, an effect that arose when a partially developed pressure replaced a short flash and then inverted the development of the image. the result was a partial negation of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further upliftment finally creates a negative image that is not to be generated on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar efficiency. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so called & quot; Velviaot; effect. it differs from saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquire; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider reps the strength of the neon light. in large pictures, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual to correct color contrast and brightness of the photo. you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the opposite problem: a too large saturation. even in this case, the brightness / saturation tool is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tools Gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool tone correction is located to improve exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of sliders for the application explained here. concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel, or the selected range. under the graph, three sliders are clicked into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left hand represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use it is to move the controller and take care of how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right-hand side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamically, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it is possible to set whether the histogram is represented by a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pipettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, medium and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to interactively change output values as in the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and store: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and reloaded later. to do so, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values will be automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect displayed only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of adjusting input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifying channel: this box allows to specify the channel to be changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Next to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera, the linear mode is mostly the most meaningful. in this case, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case logarithmic mode continues.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the associated pixels will darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photo is a red marker to see. if you want to shift this selection to the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and store: with these buttons you can do exactly that. each curve you've created can be stored in the file system and later loaded. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When using this method and the three color pipettes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, mid- and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if detected in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect displayed only in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the luminance channel. shade and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the digiplug; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first hint on how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and impact. the left part of the window will show you a preview. the original can be viewed as a comparison of your own tab.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target picture has a red marker. if you position it in the image a vertical line in the histogram will show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: control for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminance, the image will retain the overall brightness as well, since the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from farrowing. color-brow consists of small noise artefacts that do not occur at the same location in the color channel and their noise patterns in each channel look different. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color brewing first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and Load buttons are used precisely for this purpose. you can save and load any arbitrary mixer setting for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect displayed only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the option Luminance is enabled. the original picture is shown below (1) and the edited picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since color images can easily be converted to the calculator. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks great, with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. thus similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange Filter: simulates a black / white film imaging with orange lens filters. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic sky effects and can simulate the moon light scenes at the time of the day. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold to the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of bleaching a pressure and re-development in a Sepiatonic. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 cokin (tm) sepipentine.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the digiplug; tool texture apply you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can look like an oil painting on a canvas, stitch an old master, a Pop Art Portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shifting this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textual effect has been applied in the picture below. the original picture is (1) and the changed under (2) to be seen. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the digiplug; add tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you insert the desired frame type for your image. thoroughly reviled the image with a colored line, niepce transforms it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), bevelled it with a nice three dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the range of values for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target picture decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool After aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture at any place. this also goes to several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. just enter the text and place it with the mouse. the larger the image, the bigger the character set has to be. finally, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click on the "OK" button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the digiplug; use tool template you can put a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Picture Template menu in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations concerning size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to minimize the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to & digikam, you simply send an email in English to the digiplug; mailing list digiplug-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the button root folder in the dialog. select the folder where you have copied the template files.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder. selecting a folder will automatically update the template's thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button increases the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Downsize: this button reduces the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole image, you must resize the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the picture lying under the template. take the picture and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but produces granular images especially in dark areas.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurred mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually it sharpens no bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric dunst and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitalized images need a correction of sharpness. this is due to the fact that the digitization process is composed of only minimal differences to one color point. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras typically require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">For JPEG images, a camera often has an internal sharpness. images in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners apply a depth of field even while reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. this allows you to use the menu entry Conducting Door.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful with this, because the results don't work very naturally: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen an image refocus the tool. you can refocus more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the image a bit softly is much easier than sharpening it. use the tool for softening with the menu entry Conducting softness and experiment with some settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values often generate good results and should first be tried. an increase in radius or amount strengthens the effect. if you make the blurring mask too strong, noise and the impression of grats are created near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should sharpens pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference amount to be applied. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference in order for an edge of the filters to be applied. thus areas with a soft exchange between the sounds are excluded from the sharper and therefore beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the machined image the (2). blurred massage was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The digiplug; tool refocus refocus a picture by enhancing the sharpness. it used the copyrighted abfaltation filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filter. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurring mask. refocus usually achieves better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß's cleavage. the auss' sche cleavage has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixles, which are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Vienna Inverse of the Gauß's folding is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular hotness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should yield 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. useable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise Filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce artifacts. however, values above 0.1 are only rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very poor.</seg>
<seg id="502">This is the radius for the sharpness of the gauge. in most cases, you should leave this parameter to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value unequal to zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Die Size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß's edge. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocussed parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all trimming, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not immediately visible, but they leave unpleasant artefacts later.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, & eg; than JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by using the unsharp masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp masking must always produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of sharpness. for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. practically, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blurred mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocussed image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the field of sharpness in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The smoothing trowel offset the blurring of the range of the dimmed area to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink tints allow a customized colour for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inert Algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various pre-settings as starting points to simplify the restoration process. the available pre-settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail Repellation p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothing over the image. a value of 0.9 should get details in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards. please note that the detailing should always be subordinated to the directional dependence.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value is smoothed close to 1 only in one direction. JPEG Artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more will be smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turmob effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. usually, 1 or 2 suffices.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle increment da [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is chosen small, it should also be chosen small. make sure that small angles generate a long run time. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Using linear interpolation: the more quality you get by selecting this option is minimal, but it doubles the duration. we therefore recommend it to omit it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and Load buttons make exactly this. any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">The module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a strange black artefact in the foreground that was caused by a poor movie bearing during the trip. the original picture is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digiplug; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artifacts such as dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on digital cameras from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise which can be removed successfully with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases only the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced Settings can stay with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can wipe the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller bugs fixed.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness of the field. this value sets the pixel spacing that the filter looks forward to detect luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or greasing occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: checks edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the whole noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak rustling or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we advise you to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we advise you to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma-tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas which are typically stronger smoked. however, it also lubricates the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of phase jitter. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother. if it is raised, noise and phase jitter appear at the edges.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2).</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crap for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the image a bit softly is fortunately much easier than sharpen an image. use the tool for softening with the menu entry Conducting softness and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digitised; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration provides you with the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well suited for removing Gauß's noise, film granulation, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized pictures. the smoothing takes place along the image contours and thereby preserves the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture replacement. the texture statement is performed with another tool, image error correction. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">Reduce JPEG Artefacts: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save as and Load buttons make exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and recharged later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a minolta (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film granulation on the faces. the original picture is shown below (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time, textures were applied to an old color photo that was scanned with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts caused by scanner lighting and photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The digiplug; tool Hotpixel allows hotpixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem, eight. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels quot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark-screen subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file in the wizard with the darkimage button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these will be highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark picture directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD Defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the matching dark picture to the image to be adjusted. automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the Wizard notices the last dark and recharges it automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview help you to correct the result inside the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel block are moved to the calculation of a bi-linear interface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are approached to compute a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are moved to compute a bi-dim surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixel in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotpixel correction on a color photograph, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, applied. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digitization; vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not uniformly illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignettierhote; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has drawbacks. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to hold the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as there are otherwise blurring effects caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure area of today's felt and color grading depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a rough image without this filter. the tool vignetting correction applies the transformation with a center filter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target picture.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of loss of light at the point of greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which compensates an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Brightness, Contrast, and Gamma Settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the regulator only provides positive values, since you only have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the digiplug; image processing from the Color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of vignetting correction applied to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a correction and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digiplug; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. color distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth grading adjusts the remote corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the distortion of the second degree. with negative values, toned distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the fourth degree. this value acts more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lentils the 'corners' parameter has the inverted character of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resumes the image size and causes a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Lighten: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box shows the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The pitch or pincision correction should be performed before any cutting or size changes. best result in this correction as the first one. if you cut a picture anew and then perform a ton-shaped correction, the effect would obviously be the wrong one.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal guide line. move it to an important location, such as the sea side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the tone / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the cropping tool in the Transforming Cutting menu or the Zoom controller of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures, the tone-shaped correction is sufficient. the next logical step for some motifs such as shots from the front, frames and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the ton-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown in (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate Infrared film of the GennGuru.org web page that is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left of the window you can select the area for the preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters of film granulation and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the option Add movie granulation if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO knob changes the amount of the film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in conversion. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes colour channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is shown below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">This is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The viewing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, street photographic, granular view especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, adjusted to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the zoom effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity matches ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">The upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original picture is marked with the (1) and the edit is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smoothing 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiplug; filter carbon drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage roll. the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch you. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with one value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pen size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon-marking filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digiplug; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures back with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure, in which color is not the most important thing in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monotonous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, equal to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave block 1: divides the image into cells and lets it look as if it is viewed through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom blurring: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a central point. this simulates the blurring of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurred the image by turning the pixels around a focal point. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to come back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blurring: blurred the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: taken from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blurring: blurred the image softly in the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and glossy soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurred the image by chance shifting of the pixels and simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: finds the ink paddling in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. so you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="624">Raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives natural your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes changes the optical effect of drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can keep with the digiplug; image processing an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should stay free. if you then start the filter raindrops the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can put it in the right direction by mirroring or rotating. the tools can be found in the Transforming / Transformation menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom in or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm that is used here makes a good work here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select to change size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to change size uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality, then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. & Edit; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflated was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be maintained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more will be smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turmob effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any stuttering for photo magnification can be saved as a text file and later recharged.</seg>
<seg id="638">Blowing photo is very fast with what it does, but it can take very long and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below for example for photo blowing by magnifying a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. the image processing allows you to create a picture with the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and moving the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">You can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging at the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by simply pressing the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with cutting, use the button The trimming button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut to size (Ctrl; + X). use the Save file or Save file in the File menu to save the newly-cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview pane, you can change the size of the rectangle by dragging the corners with the mouse, maintaining the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the larger value is always assigned to the height and in the cross-format of the width.</seg>
<seg id="645">This means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimetres, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog you can place with the Max. relationship button the area for cutting on the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool according to aspect ratio will save its settings depending on the image orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings will be displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data will reflect the cropped image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the coaster help make it easier to fade in, so that you can put your pictures together better. these help files are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangles are based on the principle of similarity. as the third-third rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into similarly harmonious triangles on the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden middle is a division that affects various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden split is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your images, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden centre.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides smoother auxiliary lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal to achieve good results for your photos. in comparison to the third angel, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this kind of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should give something that the eye is in the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also derive from the golden spiral above discussed above. its vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles. diagonal to these lines can be published a static object dynamical.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect created by professional photographers dynamic symmetry. try to place your image focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the guides. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it happens easily that you do not hold the camera exactly vertical or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated by an angle. you can fix this with the digiplug; image processing and the tool free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slide angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. with the button presets you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned an image you will find undesired triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function Transforming Cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to trim the image is the automatic cropping function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliasing option smoothing the image a bit after turning. note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the top left: indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper right-hand corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right-hand corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is a little lubricated. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double so powerful effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transforming cropping out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shearing tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part to the left. this is not rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Shoot your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, like the sea, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the shearing tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the image is blurred a bit. for a single shearing this effect is usually negligible, but two sations produce twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shearing the picture has triangular holes in the corners. one way to remove them is to cut the image with transforming cropping out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & Edit.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency of other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all the file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them.</seg>

<seg id="686">Nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select even the format you want to use. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia. & Edit; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression methods to digital images. in doing so, redundant information is reduced to store the image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save lossless if specified in the settings.</seg>

<seg id="725">Graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs which & graphviz include are obsolete & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with only a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphiviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphic interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraph viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -Graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphical viewer; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; an. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kates; and & konqueror; (so that a change in the graph in & kate; recompute the graph and represents in & kgraphiviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs in & kate; open or open the graph in & kgraphical; in a & kate; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems with about 1000 nodes and a hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Other needed software: & kgraphiviewer; is a & kde; program which presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for representing the graphs. needed are:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. initially, when you start & kgraphical viewer; without starting a argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list Recently opened files. click the first icon to open the File dialog.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the bottom screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or let this position be selected automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (up and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt; -key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zoom is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum size reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or if you want to ignore the change. & kgraph viewer; can also remember your decision so that later it will proceed as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can set the menu item Settings kgraphiviewer; set up..., see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graph file outside of an ongoing & kgraphical viewer; or eg; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kgraphical viewer; or to display the graph to be loaded in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When you start the program, you can open all graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice as well as change it later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph will be split into several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely selected.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come on one side will be placed on this page. the aspect ratio will be ignored. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled in from the parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph displayed on several pages without header and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut Loading site gives the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been changed on the hard drive, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or let the program ask for each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">You can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a sub-window of the already running session) or specify that every time it is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives you the ability to specify the startup behavior of & kgraphical viewer; you can set a default behavior (open or not) the files of the last session or decide to be asked for each start.</seg>

<seg id="750">The algorithm defines the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edges of edges as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for nonerect graphs. it produces representations according to the springboard model. the Kamada Kawai algorithm is used which is synonymous with statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a springboard model for noneried graphs. it uses the Frutigen-pure gold heuristics, and includes a multi-grid trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the nodes in a circle shape according to the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog where you can specify a layout command, which is then run by a shell. the command should accept the graph file as a parameter, and display the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can specify & eg; the & graphviz; algorithm, or change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>

<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: use the Kooka interface to read pictures from a scanner that is supported by the Sane project or another source such as Video Streams. to make this work you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu entry Images, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. choose the source from which you want to get the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears by replacing the default values ducroth to select your image accordingly. see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you start scanning the image. the estimated file size is displayed in the right, lower corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure the window will be completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the Scan button you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window to set the image file options appears. please remember that the BMP type does not compress and therefore creates very large files. you must also select or create the folder & # 160 by saving the image.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographical localization allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data are stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localization provides tools to localize images in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization correlative. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and enter the menu. the above dialog will then appear. to find a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a track file using a GPX file. this file contains, of course, data taken at the same locations at the same locations as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded an automatic correlation between the coordinates in red indicates. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera is converted to GMT. this can be done with the GMT time zone. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera number. if the deviation is below, the data will be merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no track data from one place for images, you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options Interpolarity and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have adequate data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the correlate button to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same place. as the dialog tells the coordinates from one call to the next, you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set using the displayed map. select the region in question and enlarge it. always select this until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to attach GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module Image Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the preview pane and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is mostly self explanatory. if you then click on a picture, a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default screen viewer, & eg; Dextershow</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG File Format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With Other color depth, you can change the default color depth, which of course also influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnails will allow you to adjust some of the settings from the Album tab for thumbnails which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user how far the action is. click Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during creation. the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as twists, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is shown by default in full screen mode. this can be changed into a windowed mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree module is a tool for changing images without compromising your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is the file size increases as there is no compression of the color information. for example, this can also be found in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing them, please contact the KIPI team's mailing list under kde-imaging @ kde.org. caution: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailing list of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata. the data will be copied by clicking the OK button.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere but not write to any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG encoding module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The module MPEG encoders can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video with a defined length. this module uses the packages Mjpegs and ImageMagick. between the individual pictures you can insert a basic image transition. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally you can select a background color for the slideshow. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD Player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG diaschau. afterwards, you can create the module via Tools MPEG Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you select are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change sorting of images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should indicate the time in seconds that a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is set below. a low value generates very sudden, a high, very smooth picture change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should let them black. you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file. keep the extension mpg as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all the settings according to your wishes, you can use the coding button to start generating the movie. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now drink a cup of coffee quickly or in peace and enjoy the slideshow when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the Mjpeg Tools and ImageMagick Packages using the Settings icon at the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also automatically be opened using the Image Image Gimp. this is e.g. useful to improve you or print out with the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from him is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now readjugate the values in order to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings for the white balance should be used. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue enhancers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can process the image further later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have an effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG has a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images frequently or later on, you should not choose the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a memory format, the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is useful if they were created in a previous attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the number and timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images in a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can resize or enlarge the image. for this purpose four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 dot): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option e.g. to adapt your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will be displayed with the images you selected. you can add more images using a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview will be displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the images list to add the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">Removing images will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your E-Mail client with the button OK. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures you selected are attached as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not pay too many pictures at once. most email accounts have limitations for the size of e-mails to be sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments to the images are put together into a text file and attached to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format in the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original EXIF data will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages, searching for bugs. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end. with the closing button you can close this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau, a window appears with questions like you want to have displayed your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all images of the album here.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL output option allows very elegant image transitions by means of OpenGL. however, you have to have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option displays that the filename of the images in the lower left corner will be displayed during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The Loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop. you can then manually break it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">Selecting images randomly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The time interval between the pictures can be set between the pictures. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. randomly, each transition between the images selects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slideshow, you can access a toolbar at the upper left corner of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left bottom of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has not currently been documenting. if you are interested in writing them, please contact the KIPI team's mailing list under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module Background Image is a tool for setting a picture as background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image depending on the selected option of the sub-menu, as a background for your KDE working surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have finished your pictures and videos with annotations, you can browse through this photo album; see the picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, there are entries in each group, i.e. persons, places and in the group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and, of course, view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">With this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view images of your area of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can do with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button located on the outside on the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can select what view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can e.g. display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you do not have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">You must, however, define which image should be displayed for each individual person. in order to do this, you will need to open the image view window (in more detail) and select the image for the appropriate person. in the View window, you can customize the image for the appropriate person. in the View window, you can customize the magnifying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you access the search in the main window, a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog at once.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you would like, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can be either a part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the entire date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window you can search all the pictures by certain names as you can see in the picture. here you will find pictures on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals, but rather want to try out some functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and watch the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & PhotoAlbum; and select in the first dialog the demo, if you launch & kphotoalbum; start the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; demo. then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this bar displays date statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">You can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The time bar can be interactively used in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image will display this date in the preview pane) and also the timeline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of time bar by holding down the mouse button and dragging the mouse over the ruler of the time line, i.e. the time data. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar on the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your pictures. the one is integrated in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other is available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum is described, which you can create via the menu File HTML....</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas Content, Layout and Objective. in the following, each section is described in more detail.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the overview and a description that the HTML file will contain later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, choose whether a photoalbum; -export file is to be created which can be seen on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information should be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed, which is obvious to the viewer without a description. for example, all images are exported by a party. therefore, you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can define how the HTML pages should look. most settings are unique, which is why it is not specifically dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images, so those who view your website and have a monitor supporting the maximum resolution 800x600 cannot download images, for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">Viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you specified. so it can browse your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if you want to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this settings area, you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select the location for all future pictures. here you can either select a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if these are really all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created will be started. the URL you specify here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder, you will need to manually copy them there. so that the import function, see, correctly works you have to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings you have just described have moved all three to base folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder will be created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in the fact whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a shortcut to images. the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you have all the pictures together and can pass this file so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file directly from the File Export menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are found in the .kim file folder. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is, of course, only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following will describe the dialog for exporting images you can exporting from the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three options are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the Manuell option to copy the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically copy to the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit the image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you may not want to send the images in full size since the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu file... you will import & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folders you want to import pictures to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category persons of the file to be imported (if you are a Dane) while this category is named in your database. therefore, in the third dialog box you will be asked what categories of the import file to import and which categories these are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your present database.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump inside of different picture groups. if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will follow the various steps of (1) setting the information about your images, about (2) the search and prestige, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has started as a program to manage your images, but it has been expanded and now your videos will take care of you.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of your images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">If you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum, then you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. for example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">The menu entry settings kphotoalbum; set up... get to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; the different settings options are explained in the following section of the user manual.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left, you will see six different symbols, with which you can view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call on the F1 key and click on the desired option by pressing a button.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog used to edit already existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a caption and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the Options dialog, subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog you can set up full member groups, e.g. all members of a group set up at once in a group rather than all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list of options listed above, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left panel, you can find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; splits your modular system with other graphics applications, such as digicam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">Modules can and will not be described in this manual, since they are not part of the photoalbum; however, most modules have a help page, which you can call over the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together by several applications, it may be that the modules were tested with a photoalbum; only very little was tested. therefore, you should first test new modules with the demo database before using the &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't say I hadn't warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use together with KIPI are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between the photoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications simply put their pictures into albums: this is an album just a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this type of order is not supported, it simulates order for albums so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulating & kphotoalbum; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view, so all images that show you the picture preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, we have to pass a list of albums to the modules. here's a photoalbum, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry in this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you set up in the settings dialog as category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category Persons, then & kphotoalbum will do so, so whether you had selected people to view and pass this on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select in the module you want to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start the photoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you will see a menu and a toolbar at the top of the toolbar. at the moment, it does not contain much information as you do not have any information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see each image with annotations. this includes information about the persons shown on the picture, where the image has been taken. for example, each image can be displayed individually or for a larger number of images at the same time. if, for example, pictured on all pictures Jesper and all images are recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these remarks by using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">See three lists with a text box where you can define people, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons, you can so that the used names are moved up to find and assign people faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the quote for sorting by date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you may want to edit all selected images and annotate them with annotations. in this case, simply click on the above and back buttons that are located below the picture to the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have taken several images, e.g. with the same person, it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple read entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the US. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you will see a browser window that displays the USA as an overboard. to show you that it is an overboard, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory. additionally, you can also simply drag an entry into a category and place it there to sort it into a sub-category of this entry. attention, this assumes you just sort your categories alphabetically. see for this.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and dragging the bars that form the top edge of the frames. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside the window pane.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options button... which gives you among other things the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you want to get this window visible later, use the Options button... and then hide / hide window. see this in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry pictures in the browser, you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images, or of all images if you do not have a filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of the thumbnails, by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on an image, this will appear in the image viewer. if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the respective pictures you want to delete and either select the delete button or select Delete from the Edit menu. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">You can use with & kphotoalbum; you can also use the pictures somewhere, so that you can record it in the database index. in the picture you will see the view from & kphotoalbum; if not all necessary pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is clipped are not stored on the hard drive. however, for the images 5-9, the thumbnails are present, so that the preview of these images can show you. however, you can also not view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and re-copy it. & kphotoalbum; if you do not want to ask you to insert the respective CD, please buy a larger disk to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the Pictures menu you will find a sub-menu with the name of privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures in such a way that at the end those left are left in the menu Privacy. alternatively, you can also control all the pictures that your little sister may see, control and lock the menu item All except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">So you have specified which images should be hidden in case of the case. if you give your laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu item images to be hidden. if you want to get the images displayed again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply change password in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">On the one hand, anyone who can access the file index.xml may read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection only serves to deny the view to private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason & kphotoalbum; about a picture _ and video viewer. you can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. he obviously shows the picture, but additional all the information you have to enter about the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag them with the mouse and move somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information should be displayed at all. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer. the then appearing context menu can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the infobox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see the appropriate entries for this. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and down. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and End. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">When multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can enter the image in and out. using the mouse button, you can easily zoom in a rectangle with the mouse button. with the minus button, you can zoom in again The plus button zooms in the center of the image. shows how a zoom-rectangle is selected and shows the outcome of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the dot key, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the key button sets the zoom, so every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that function for videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotation functions from the context menu you can rotate the image. this does not work for videos. you can make comments to the current image using the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image. at the moment you can cancel the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter that name. however, you may prefer to mark only the image and view more images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to develop the images on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad as you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to add pictures with characteristics as you view them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can place a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in the picture you see a picture in which the characters A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">As soon as you have attributes to your pictures, these are available to you in the browser. so if you have any images that you edit, print or whatever you have selected, simply put them all at once with comments. this is described in. afterwards, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you just want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview screen. if you want to view categories in a special preview view, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you can perform a photoalbum; painting on the image.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch will not be saved with the image, but in the database. in this way you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to complete the painting mode of & kphotoalbum, select View on the image from the context menu. to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the application of the program & Povray; not fully control, but the documentation too & Povray; should you absolutely have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the object tree views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the object of an already selected object, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu is displayed to allow you to choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Either from the Edit menu or from the right-click context menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to apply these changes. if you entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click on Apply or reject the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -User documentation in the Setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press on preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture will be rendered, even if you want to render just a part of the texture (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), tick local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as the wire model. you can specify this value relative to the Visibility level of the parent object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only when selected or their Visibility level is smaller or equal to the Visibility level selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need another configuration, you can set it as you like. you can also save several window orders and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a present view, drag the user to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the user to the right or left side of a view. the new view will then be anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, drag the beginner right in the middle of another view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the tabs at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are hovering views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to resolve a view from the anchoring, drag the user to the desktop or click on the small pointing arrow pointing at the bottom of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the Anfal toolbar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can paste additional views into the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for any type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor it anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with the View Window System... Save. a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render them render. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the Rendering icon in the toolbar, or select Rendering the menu item View.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes, from a quick preview up to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the Change settings icon in the toolbar or select View modes from the View menu, the following dialog will open:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but sense is a name that lets you recognize the characteristics of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to render a small area of the image, select the section subsection and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination with quality you can select the properties that are used & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User Manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel, various errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and details are sometimes not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel in the representation. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of this error. generally, pictures with this feature look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculate and connect & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. adaptive, non-recursive method; adapted because the super-sampling refers to the neighbouring pixels. the second method is adaptive; recursive because every pixel is split up again and again because the reclaim depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between the colour values to the adjacent pixels crosses the specified threshold, a grid of 4x4 will be calculated with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 will be calculated with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the colour values exceeds the default threshold, the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are further pursued and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called jittering. if you turn on jittering, alter & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">This tab allows you to determine if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is transparent when the associated beams have not hit any object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly finished, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray file, select the Import-File menu item... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the complete command range of & Povray;. when importing error messages or warnings occur, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not want to support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRwBegin and / / * PMRwEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can paste source text for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the property view, opens & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. set the path to your document and the version. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example height data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catching of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the sphere, you can set the level of detail separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high detail fidelity for extended projection, all wire model views will be further divided when the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projection. this property creates a better approach to projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you tick the wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is represented in a checkerboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the floor, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a checkerboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When you tick on edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. the values for depth and threshold can be adjusted. more precise information on the parameters can be found in the Render modes section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements. in the section window orders we explain how to create and save window arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combination Field Standard Window System: displays all existing window arrangements. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">A new arrangement allows you to create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views of the selected window arrangement. new views can be created with the Add button and deleting selected views with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">With New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with tab card you get a map view together with the previous view and hovering the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without further knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: one ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before complaining that you only receive a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should observe these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you will get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything correctly, see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the icons of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you can get an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols often, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">To follow this guide, you first have to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit menu item. now you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you will notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray, see further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Don't change anything about the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera has control points in the view that you can change the destination point of the camera. just click with the left mouse button on a checkpoint and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the user or press the enter key, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately accordingly to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you could for example insert a cube (insert finite body Quaders) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite layer as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plane in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also shows the level, albeit at the moment only as a finite finite level. when you rename the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree accurately, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor when clicking on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and displacement.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to practice a unit under the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. choose shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First choose the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment choose something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens in which you can choose how to insert the object. please select First subobject. the pigment will then be displayed in the property tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom-Pigment), with a click on the button Preview you see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment only shows a matte black material because you have to re-enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you do not see any color on the rectangle and sphere in the preview, click on the Apply button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is set correctly now. if you now render your image with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, these are not the colors that you expected. here are additional settings necessary. in the color list, you must enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the checkerboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree each time, select in color and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should be able to execute this step simply because you have already understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget the enter key or the button Apply), so the ball contact with the ground. otherwise the ball would float above the floor as you moved the ground around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering now results in a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the following step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can now assign a material. as with the ground, give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First subobject and change the name for example in sphere Pigment. click on sphere Pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The gloss effect and reflection effect already result in good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces even when metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of the possibilities offered to you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracytracing is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracing a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected and broken by the objects, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will affect. thus the scene pixels for pixel are processed.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the image is just black. obviously, any scene that should be rendered is needed some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you created previously with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. any changes since the last storage will be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last undo command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used edit backups.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Save the current window arrangement and open a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting of & kpovmodeler;, here you can change the appearance, keyboard shortcuts and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcuts. with this option you can add commands preset to & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler using this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any diffraction on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a bump map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuppshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in their own window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & outershow; it is very easy. the file browser lists files that you can use with clicking the & LMBn or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You can set up any existing multimedia keys in such a way that they work as & Amarok; short commands function. this makes your keyboard to & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions that can mostly also be found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browsers, players, playlists, playlists browsers and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options from Qt and & kde;. in addition, Amarok has some custom command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give a feedback to the user if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use kdialog to tell the user why a script does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin with require 'Korundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'dialog --sorry' # {error} 'exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as a basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; which should be included in every KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages make it possible to execute external programs and commands. for this purpose, the exec () function is usually used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this reason strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore events when there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weist tells the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange Signaling that a new piece is played. the script might now & zb; with DCOP functions, you can query additional information about the new piece (for example metadata or unit length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newvolume signalizes a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a user-defined menu item is clicked. to remove an entry you can use dcop Amarok script removeCustomize menuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to carry out e.g. cleaning jobs. this includes, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user & zb have downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar Archive (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2), so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with catamaran encoding. for this reason, you should rename your script packages correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can put it on www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page by & Amarok. for your entry on kde-apps, you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus. perhaps you just search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's Sammet Browser and Quick Find you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Perhaps you have already some playlists, but you can never decide which one you want to hear? then the playlists browser is just right for you. and if the decision is still difficult, the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used so that SIE can choose how to listen to your music. this and many more useful features make Amarok the most advanced audio player. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right thing to experience your music anew!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually, in the base folder of the Amarok sources, you have to enter the following to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & Amarok; autoconf and automake are used, you should have no difficulty in compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them to the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time using the configure script. this is a list of options available.</seg>
<seg id="1207">Some of the compile options have to be filled with certain dependencies so that they can be used. details can be found in the system requirements section.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Activates debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help in the development of & Amarok; you should use full.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& Amarok; can be set up without effort via the Setup dialog. the Setup dialog has several card cards to set up the different functions of & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1210">If the option is turned off, only the playlist window will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Use mood barometer: this function is only available when & Amarok; compiled with support for moodbar. the option switches the experimental function of the mood barometer.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Atmospheric design: this function is only available when & Amarok; compiled with support for moodbar. this alters the used color scheme for the mood barometer.</seg>
<seg id="1213">Storing mood files in the music files: this feature is only available when & Amarok; with support for moodbar compiled. if this option is enabled, .mood files will be stored in the settings folder of & Amarok; usually ~ / .kde / share / Amarok / moodbar /).</seg>
<seg id="1214">External Browser: lets you choose which browser of & Amarok should be started when a browser is needed.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Use other browsers: here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Save playlist when you exit, save the current playlist automatically when you exit & Amarok; Enable this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist upon exit.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually saved playlists: when you enable this setting, & Amarok will use; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, otherwise the absolute position of the music files will be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keeping up-to-date piece when changing the play causes the playlists to scroll up / down to keep the each running piece in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Changing to the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can adjust & Amarok; s appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the fonts section you can select the use of different fonts in & Amarok. by selecting own fonts, the otherwise grey section is activated. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist window, player window and context browser. click Select... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the choice of Custom color scheme, you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme. use the color selection activated for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Resume play at startup causes & Amarok; after program start, playback will resume automatically with the piece at the point with which it was stopped at the last exit.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Setting up the On-Screen display allows you to turn on the OSD. if on-screen display is clicked, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shadow causes the text to be displayed in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Use own colors gives you the opportunity to customize the OSD colors for font and background. one click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection. if own colors are not activated, the pre-set & kde; colors are used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The Display text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering wildcards, the OSD can be adjusted to your needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The Screen option is intended for Xinerama users. this allows you to set the OSD on which screen of a multi-monitor environment.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The Audio Output Driver Card lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down box. some drivers still activate more settings in this card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The collection card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. this includes the folders and type of the database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folders that & Amarok should search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes to adjust how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes & Amarok; both the intersected and their subfolders will be searched for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: allows & Amarok; to monitor the selected folders for changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). incremental search is also performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import Playlists: causes & Amarok to add all the found playlists in your collection folders (.pls- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will appear later in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further installation in the MySql facility is required.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql device section will be used to set up the database for & Amarok. under Calculator: will the host enter where the MySql database is located. then, under Port: the network port is entered, under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use Username: and Password: to enter the data you need to connect to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The last.fm card supports the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations for the current piece if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you do not have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send played pieces and thus update the profile: this setting makes it possible & Amarok; to transmit the names of played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Retrieve similar interpreters: after activating this setting, the Amarok will get a list of similar performers to the played piece. you can see the list in the context browser. note: you don't need a last.fm profile to use this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package of kdelibs and no further KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & Amarok; needs some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we wrote a small tutorial on how to compile kdelibs minimally.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD presuppose that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by clicking in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the TagLib developer using bugs.kde.org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly this is because taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this error to the TagLib developer using bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of & Amarok; used libraries were compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable automatic switch automatically when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use 1 second value.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens with a crash). if it is a common crash and you send us a good backtrace, the bug is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta-information, but do not label them as Unicode. the following Perl script solves the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "File $ARGV [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib &gt; new ($ARGV [0]\ "unless $mp3 &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarocapp: symbol lookup error: amarocapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setpixmapERK7Qpixmap, then please check that Amarok uses the correct Qt library. you can see this with ldd 'which amarocapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf to customize the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are several possibilities. most installation problems are solved easiest by using an expert to your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in channel # Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for help. please enter only one error there if you have something to fix a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; only an empty playlist appears. how do pieces of music get inside there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is easy. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the interface intuitive, the Start sub-window has been converted to the Statistics window. you will find it under Extras Statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars represent the rating by the user, while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate pieces, the rating column needs to be displayed in the playlist. click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for one piece. you can also use the shortcuts Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove, then click Delete on your keyboard. or right click on your selection and then select From playlist from the drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let it fall, just like you would do with other files. it's that simple: -)</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you are using the Alsa sink, the device must provide a mixer. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause and solution. for Streamer, you may need to specify a different sink (e.g. ossedsink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">You can't just send a MP3 to ALSA, you would only hear a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer is reading the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open control center sound & multimedia sound system. enable sound server with highest priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">KDE 3.2.x has problems with KDE multimedia codecs that can cause disturbed playback. read this error report. enlarge the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either do not use the Arts driver, but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE-Multimedia to get the faster Arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably use the Arts driver. use another driver (the xine driver has been greatly optimized for Analyzer), or reduce the size of the Arts buffers in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system.</seg>

<seg id="1326">Creating a playlist is very simple. drag and drop entries from the collection browser into the playlist. the small text field for filtering the collection eases the search for certain pieces. if you are satisfied with the playlist, you can save it with the help of the button playlist. you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window.</seg>
<seg id="1327">When you have custom playlists, you can add them to your playlist. if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection, and you have enabled the playlist to import, then you will be able to access a playlist by right-clicking on a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1328">To play an audio CD, select Action Audio CD in the menu bar. it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format. simply drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the playback button.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The audio CD function uses the audio cd: / and is not compatible with all available drivers.</seg>
<seg id="1330">The Burn function is also available in the playlist. just right click one entry and follow the Burn menu. you have several options for burning a CD.</seg>
<seg id="1331">& Amarok; requires installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. additionally, some additional packages are listed which make work with & Amarok; more pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you must also install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. as any normal multimedia player also has & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to everyone else. the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The Player Window is your one-click & Amarok; Control Center. at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current play, bit rate, and samplerate of the current piece. one click on this section changes the display of the already expired playing time for the remaining play time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, even under the running text display. you can switch by the available analyzer by clicking the left mouse button on the pane.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, magnifying window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons can also be found under the scroll bar. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlist window, while the EQ button is used to set the equalizer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the sliders to adjust the play position or volume. using the playback buttons, you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous step.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own default settings.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the Equalizer check box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The Playlist of & Amarok; is the most widely developed playlist of all available for & kde; available multimedia players. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. however, don't let the abundance of functions deter you, they're all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left is the navigation area. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser shows different information regarding the current piece. its look can be adapted with the help of context browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, Text and Interpret. these three subwindows are later explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have earlier used earlier versions of & Amarok; you may notice that the subwindow has dropped off. the information presented there has now been distributed to other parts of & Amarok. furthermore, the information can be collected in the statistics panel (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover image of the album and besides a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to see the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Under the MusicBrainz symbol you will find more information about the current piece. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">The images may have any names, but pictures with the word front in the name are treated preferentially. the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will play immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpreter. this section displays the five most rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information should be displayed in the music subwindow. to do so, right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current interpreter that you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be opened and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This function is very flexible and it is possible to download the text for the piece from other web pages. once you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is running, you can choose which should be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Find button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - grouped only the top layer, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - first of all the pieces are arranged according to the interpreter and there is a further division after the respective album. if you want to see compilations or soundtrack albums, then this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Different Artists.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / Year - Album - Sort by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is used.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are displayed alphabetically by each other. the artist is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / interpreter - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping genre / interpreter / album - This setting works just like the above but is additionally sorted by album below the performer.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders. if you own many pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly below the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. instructions for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Below the search filter there is a selection box that allows you to filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. you can also choose from the last 24 hours up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="1368">Clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser gives you the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This empties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Append to playlists - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry, you will reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces to queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue. this will be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be prompted for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces to the queue to transfer to the Media Player. for more details, see the section on the Media Player Browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this performer / burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned either as a data or an audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) Move files to the trash bin... - Opens a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears under Various Artists.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Pick up a selection list - edit a record selected as a compilation album back into a normal album. after that the album will not be shown again under different performers but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes it easy to deal with a lot of playlists. among other things, it also includes Intelligent Playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlists browser contains the smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">You can also add smart playlists created by yourself. click on Intelligent Playlists to open the dialog to create a new smart playlist, where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow is used for connecting & Amarok; to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok; for example, your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod would be included. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sorted in the top list view of the media player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list of performers. by doing this, the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod. if the transfer is finished, quit & Amarok; and resolve the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">The search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all the files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser is an address bar with which you can get music from a given URL. if you enter for example tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz, you can access music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping. in this case, holding down the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired position. once you enter characters, only the pieces will be displayed, which contain the letters. to reset the filter press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search terms separated by spaces, then & Amarok will search for entries that contain all search terms. for example, if you enter one or two, search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter OR between the search terms, you will be searched for entries that contain either the one or the other search term. for example, one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found containing one or two or three (or a combination of it).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain spaces, then enclose the search term with goose queens: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that include Mike Oldfield, but not by entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you may also look for larger or smaller. for example, Rating: &gt; 50. This search for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variations as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this search for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of records by pressing the Ctrl key, and then right-click on the entries. the entries then get a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The playlist's toolbar is located at the bottom of the playlist. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left, you find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow undo and restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar is a unique, larger analyzer. the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as that which you get in the player window by right mouse button. over this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more available buttons for the toolbar, for example playback control and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on menu and selecting toolbar buttons...</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it shows the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieval can be changed easily by double clicking on the respective display area with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. by default, disable status bar in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The contextual menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the playlist in the playlist. through this menu you can reach the settings of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1404">One click on this entry will open the Windows Visualization Plugins. there you can select the Visualizations of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry is a sub-menu with shortcuts to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover management is a useful tool to manage your cover images. you can start it by selecting actions cover management in your collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover management includes a list view of all the albums in your collection. you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left side.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu you can choose what to display in the cover management. select from:</seg>
<seg id="1409">After you set a piece into the queue, a number next to the title appears in the playlist. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will be played: 1 will be played first, 2 second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">If you want to add a piece to the queue, select the item in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces to the playlist or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue administration.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are already predefined (the details for setting up these follow later).</seg>
<seg id="1412">Fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random items while playing.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Add pieces based on Last.fm recommendations (formerly: audioscale). this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist. you don't need a Last.fm profile for this dynamic playlist to work.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double click on the playlist you want, drag them into the playlist window, or right click on it and then select Load. in this way, your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1479">The headline is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the headline does not have a real function, it only looks nice and clearly separates the project view from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box for changing the key assignments for & k3b; after you have selected one of the available commands in the top part, you can adjust the key mapping to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; Setup Wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator privileges are required, so you must enter the password for the system administrator (root) at startup.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work immediately. this dialog is intended for personalizing and fine-tuning the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also, equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can, for example, be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line program or the slightly more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and type of task is more important, which of the two programs will give you preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the dcop command line program. to be able to use the dcop command line, you have to make sure that & k3b; started. then enter something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have all & kde; program in common, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface from & k3b; provides functions like copycd, formatted DVD and other functions to create new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo DVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () void spnCdImage () void BurnCdImage (KURL url) void BurnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively one can generate a project on the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectinterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectinterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which is applicable only to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name, QString Transparent) void addUrl (KURL url, QString Transparent) void removeItem (QString path) void renameItem (QString path, QString newName) void setVolumeID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDprogram) dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; -Selection for & kde;. with it, quite simply audio CD; s can be read and stored in mp3 or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the UI of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in wav files on hard disk) and by many encoders that encode these WAV files. currently lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) are supported by default (these encoders need to be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on your computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per caption) are compressed into mp3 or OGG format or even in other formats such as lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not installed yet, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggVorbis (for OGG) or other encoders have already been installed, so it is probably not necessary to compile something by yourself. however, only the encoders need to be installed which are needed. if, for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction on encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, uses & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device does not convert the protection, it is not possible to bypass any copy protection. simply avoid buying copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be done once (the setup dialog however can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found), afterwards the daily handling of reading a & CD; this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert to many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the internet or can work completely without a network, and everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the commands of the main window. see Step by Step, for example, more information on how to use this program, as well as screenshots with descriptions of tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB inquiry of the CD data according to the set up of request in the CDDB Tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must be established.)</seg>

<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoder, so that the selection can be read with a different encoder than the default. it must be noted that previously the encoder was configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already selected file is selected for encoding rather than a complete & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as logs, beeps) for program events (such as reading out the & CD; quit).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the Main Setup dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different flashcards (such as encoders, to set up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoder and compression ratios and helps you choose the right coding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss-free audio format is required. besides FLAC, there are also others such as' shorts' or 'monkey', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences become less important as both encoders generate very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is still supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high sound quality (at high bit rates), but compared to OGG low quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG recording devices is available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - when music is also to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of audio quality parameters and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression ratio up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. requires always 256 bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good enough for music by youths, portable devices and auto-steroids. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is entered manually or automatically fetched from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can hand over / needed with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the title to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudio creator must be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs instead of entering the information themselves. it must be noted that only text is spoken here: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (referring to the author) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to dial a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (fake) address as the one in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address will not be used when accessing the data from the server (This can only be the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; for the use of freedb, the geographically nearest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org delivers a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from CD; in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading out audio CD; s. note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For saving the read WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at first opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) can be added to the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoders package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for pre-defined encoders. further information on encoders is found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and read, and whether both cdparanoia and audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and our first & CD; read out. we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 called keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found, for example, with a search engine, as it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own write permissions (eg; trying to copy something into it with the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; something that will probably only be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to proceed to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each excerpt & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoders to use (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). because we are lazy, we tell the program to use the freedb to download the freedb to download the & CD; data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them at any time of reading a & CD; change if the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program to read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of device names for the CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The tab General Settings. here is not much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is loaded / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In case of incomplete information, select query, so that you will be informed when information is missing for generating key words (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: while reading the & CD, the computer must be connected to the Internet so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, a & CD; entry found, starts immediately reading the & CD;. this is associated with low risk, if you later are dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can be easily changed. the directory or filename is changed with Konqueror &gt; and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagcher.</seg>
<seg id="1558">You can work with freedb locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before. however, this is over 620 MB big, consider this twice if this is worthwhile. in order to use freedb in offline mode, the two choices must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following map.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data the CD should be received? read the section about freedb. put it all the way it is shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freedb.org page and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally as far as the server is concerned, since many firewalls boot the protocol 8880 by default, there might be more luck with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP; protocol is usually open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to transmit data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously interpreting pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know it, so simply try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">"" "CD; discard after reading the last piece:" "" "cross this to the & CD" "" "; discard it at the end of the process." ""</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you cross this, then / / the path / folder can be specified in which the WAV files are stored. this can be useful if there is only space on another disk. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Set everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something has to be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags to version V1 and V1.1.' ID3v2 tags can be deleted upon request. in case of subsequent change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: with a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine, you can try to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have cleverly chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; the folder structure, which is organized on the hard drive, is described in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is built up as we are comfortable and want to pick up data from the freedb. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each outgoing & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we do a & CD; use those not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a bit different from the data collected for a & CD; with success from freedb fetched data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; to manually insert data instead of retrieving it from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example can be found. it is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, then the & CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, then go to the section Questions and Answers after the Help or go back to the previous section concerning basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully fetched by the freedb, all tracks are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; a window will be displayed and you can select the database entry that best fits your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not select the check box for automatic query by freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the sample on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Actual Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the field 'Current Title' unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The comment field of the album will be used for comments that apply for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb, the CD editor is not empty, but it contains already the data as shown in the screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you can not only start with the artist and album name (e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment field. if you use ID3v2 tags, you will have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudio creator; this option is set on the encoding settings tab; take a look at the section 'Basic Settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also re-create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coding or file formats. please refer to the encoder for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of an aperture CD. in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; -data anyway. for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK', go back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-Editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data, which we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece definitely and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button on the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be displayed above the parts list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece. make sure that all pieces are selected, or press the All items button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was started by clicking on the selection button selection of the reading process, this window appears for confirmation. click OK and then we will throw a look at the window with the orders and keep track of what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the Order tab to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, right under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the jobs. the first piece is currently being read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message appears when you try to work with a encoder that you have not yet installed. items that were not successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Assignment 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 in the format MP3. thus, read and code parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. for powerful machines, the result is unclear. the machine used with an AMD64 seems to have no problem at simultaneous reading and coding (of course, two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last piece is read out while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver needed for GUS cards. alsa is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color so that it is easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag and drop so that you can drag & drop; any MIDI file from a & konqueror; window to kmid can pull.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports both existing standards to save text into MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid automatically determines the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Sitting Support. when you exit & kde; during playing a song, kmid starts again with the same song again next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window into the & kmid; window. this also works with several songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the entry from the menu item, or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece will automatically start as soon as you click on the & kmid; -window. (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played successively.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once you play a piece, you can jump to any location by using the middle mouse button and moving the controller back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly, you can click the arrows left and right of the tempo display and adjust the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double click on the tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar appears like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry Pause in the menu item, thus interrupts the playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; the play.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in one piece of music in two ways. some pieces use text, others use lyrics and others use both. some pieces don't have a text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the type of event is automatically determined which uses a song so you don't have to manually adjust the karaoke text. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set a type of event, select the menu items and song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you merge. these are played by the series. in this section you can learn how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find this in the menu Collection under the point Organizing.... Click here on New and specify the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the desired items in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not stored. remember this when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song by button Add a song. it again appears the file dialog with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to Collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic adding to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">When adding Automatically to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when a piece is opened.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the row from the submenu playlists of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select Next Song, next song item from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To reverse a song skip, select the button Previous piece, select the Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted, but it does not matter as it is not stored when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers which are not general MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map translates General MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano into events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately there are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand (using your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all the required transformations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the Keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of Keymap"... END Define Keymap "Another Keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so that I can offer support in future releases of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section describes how General MIDI patches are mapped to your specific keyboard. the general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you must not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all sounds that this instrument needs to play on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60) that sounds like a gun shot.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it takes a patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that the term Drums-Patch is meant to represent a different percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to indicate how tones are mapped on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as is its presence, so you must create 128 items.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple key maps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Key maps are used mainly to map tones on percussions-channel. take a look at the included key maps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is mapped to the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the key map with the name name for that channel will be defined. if you use the ForcePatch option, all occurrences that attempt to change the patch on this channel will be ignored. in this case, patch x is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">For example, the ForcePatch option can be useful to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio adjusts in what ratio pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if therefore a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, it is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal decimal in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM pretends that a keyboard that receives a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two sounds higher up to one octave. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to play a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole set of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played sounds. view the view in the Settings menu under the point of channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo-LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality. with a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; that happens because & kmid; compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all the files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">OK, therefore support & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add to & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Make sure to enable automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & kde; desktop a & konqueror; window with my MIDI Folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or attached (if I want to play a karaoke file), just switch to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, turn off the Automatic Add to Collection setting, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.Mmid, B.mid and C.mid. At first you just want to play the first file. so set the automatic addition to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! when I hear these songs or see the postcard, it encourages me to continue programming.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; laga (Spain). I'm studying math at the University of Maacute; laga (Spain).</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: lar.exe @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You can send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will contact me under Friends of & kmid; if you want to send me a MIDI file, you should contact me, as I might already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and won't get money from anyone. I would like to point out that I only get further programming because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that pitch at AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also goes to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Mr. Petter Bieker, Marc Diefenbruch, Peter Gritsch, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error notification or even a supportive e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, my thanks also goes to all those outstanding musicians who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you do not have a sound card, you need to compile and sound with the MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL parameter. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can't listen to music, of course.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If there are any problems, contact one of the & kde; -mailinglists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to playback video files of formats supported by MPlayer or Phonon, as well as for playback of DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>

<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE website on new versions, or send the question to The & kde; user Mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called docking windows. there is always a window with a central view. optionally, there is a window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections under the bookmarks menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category persistent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy level. if you click an entry, its group and all its subsets will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the associated entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The various files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / apps categories can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself. simply click on a name of a category, select from the View menu and next edit mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to select the playlists from the Play menu and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without using the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation at startup and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / kmplayerrc and altering [General Options] No intro = 0 oblast option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & SMB; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. this would be annoying in the end animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">Smiley; & lt; & lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / bodygt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer;. here the path can be set from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the 'Console' button in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer intentionally.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything has to be configured by manually editing the file ~ / .kde / share / kmplayerrc, like setting up the backend via mimetype. here's an example of how a 'flash' is played with the swf codec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & SMB; it can even play the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">In order for the & SMB player to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as a service provider for the application / x-shock wave flash in the Setup dialog file assignments of KDE must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">To always use a pre-specified backend for a specific mime type (of course only if this is determined), this must be done by changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& SMB; can play from TV cards, either via MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be seen, the device to be used must be configured and the TV channels have to be configured. to do so, the scanner can be used in the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring VDR (Video Data Records) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in Settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port should be detected. there should be found ports to be used (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb contained in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of recording of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension for the X server must be functional. therefore, for the XFree86 server, the following must be contained in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, various names are used by KMPlayer for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, this dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introspection, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdren. when they are activated, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any evidence that I can quieter my CDROM drive when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom is as user root to run after the device has been installed. it is absolutely necessary to make sure / dev / cdrom is on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts up slowly, why does my CPU have to be tested for performance every time?</seg>

<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), letter (DIN), letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations). they should always be used in the preparation of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry about it. it is just a brief description of the features and further information on this will be given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; offers - as well as other source editors - the highlighting of the commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). if you see green areas of a green text on the screen, it is with great likelihood that some mathematical environment is not closed. however, you will be spared by the modest appearance of the output file. however, you will save time and money by highlighting.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic completion of the environments will be created when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {Command}) by & Kile; automatically a blank line (for entering the text) and the associated line to lock the command (e.g.\\ end {Command}). this function can be disabled in the menu Settings... LaTeX Commands.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows to subdivide the document into the following elements (the highest and subparagraph of the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of a mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files may be very helpful. once a DVI; file has been created, jumps & kile; by a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer to the corresponding row in & latex; -source text.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the default output of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; -files for various systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When selecting the link, the elements of the DVI; file are used with the editor and as soon as an item has been clicked in the DVI; file, the exact opposite of it. as soon as on a section in the & latex; source text was clicked, the corresponding position in the DVI; -viewer jumps.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with several files. with a master document, working with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide Master document can be set over project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick Building: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there is no error in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File Monitoring: in this mode, the DVI; file is called up-of-the-line, and there is no call from & eyepiece; after the quick-release.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit toolbar, the three large selection boxes should be noticed. the selection boxes were developed for the quick classification of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; statements for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box Other is for inserting items such as keywords, joint notes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a name for a section, an image or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a specified term (selection on a selection box possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">At & bibtex; for editing & bibtex; files are required editors. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last field of selection with the name GrÃ ¶ Ã ¶ e is used for defining the font size. it can be specified for the font size for the main text, the joints, etc. the following font sizes are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written from bottom to hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the font size. if the font size is not specified at the beginning, this can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code sample has to be entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is using the Menue Build or the button quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling. & Kile; automatically removes the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the document compiling fails, it should be searched for errors in logging. if this is not the case, logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font size. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ crow and\\ end {environment} will then grant a copy of the fonts within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes will only be verified within the environment (of\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many ways to maximize the readability and ease of use of the document. you can, for example, add certain fonts, bold print, italics, submissions, etc. these commands will either end with the\\ end command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for italics and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or any other environment. a single word in a set can be represented with\\ uph {Word} italics.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ ratio: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {rate} and ends with\\ end {rate}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source text with the & latex; markup language was presented, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard, a few adjustments should be made for better readability of the document. this should include a quote, a few passages in bold and bold print and a poem to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, editor-view or Ctrl-E can be returned to the editor (with the internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file was created, the document can be printed or converted into a PostScript; / PDF file. simply try it and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (engl. D e V ice I npc). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file the same steps as for creating the document are necessary (see). in the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document can then be printed using File (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows converting the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; file is made of the & latex; source code was created, the conversion into desired other formats can begin by using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The pre-select search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; -binaries. to do this, only Modern under Settings Kile has to be set up... Tools Building can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To do the job search, the mouse-cursor must be positioned in a line of the source text and then be clicked on preference. the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI; the viewer is then done.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; -Document of & Kile; open and bound to the corresponding line.</seg>
<seg id="1796">If there is no error when using fast construction of the & DVI, an error can be present. should an error occur, this will be displayed in the log in the log message or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log message file indicates the error source in the source text. in the editor, the buttons of LaTeX errors and NÃ ¤hster LaTeX errors can be used for leaps between the errors. the error in logging must be clicked on the error in the log and & Kile; jumps to the defective line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once you click on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template you want to use for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document. for more information, see the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">¤ufige users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or created a new file. & Kile; can create a new template by executing an existing document and selecting a file template from document... Create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template by file New, some strings are replaced with other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings... Settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entry into document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, the own template can then be selected instead of the default ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any and natural latex; files are created. in a simple way to create a template, search for a template found on the Internet and the steps described below are searched.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & kate; as internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting from many different types of text files (including also & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & kate; and its possibilities, the manual to Kate should be consulted. users of & Kile; can be there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate; start.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference which can be called over the menu LaTeX Reference. it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in & latex; use and syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-clicking with the Ctrl key to select the & tex; word. this means that in this way you\\ par\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with the left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys on the Shift key, parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse and highlight the most varied types of source texts. for example, the & latex functions; statements from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional jump marks. it is a separate type of bookmark within the text. the menu entries edit jumps or the corresponding keyboard shortcuts make the jump to the next or last jump stamp.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & Kile; although & kate; already excellent features have been added in & kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code always added & kile; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">This extended meaning does not include a text with continuous lines (as in other text editors). this expanded meaning excludes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source text. the only exploiting thing in & Kile; is that the paragraphs are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, as this command also supports & latex; commands with a backpack (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, it can be removed first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & Cate; provides the keyboard shortcut Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed. & Kile; provides with own commands here for a faster possibility. under Edit, the following commands are included for deletion of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is included in the description of the paragraph paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been pointed out that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore offers & kile; for further orders under Editing Environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is).</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is before or within the\\ begin {Environment} command, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested environment commands, you can quickly lose sight of the environment. this command completes the most recently opened environment, so that the nested environment structure is not disturbed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kipling; also provides special orders for the & latex; groups defined by brackets {...}. under Editing TeX group are some important commands that correspond to those from editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is).</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is).</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the curly bracket of a & tex; group #, jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested groups-braces it is possible to get lost quickly. this command completes the most recently opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple quotes are used as bed tags. for practical implementation is used in & boxes; the sign "used for two simple quotes." & Kile; knows this case and fills two close-up signs for & latex; a.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of the double quotation marks can be set up under Settings... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used for specific settings (such as naudi or french) and therewith German or French characters. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When you press Shift, enter & kick; an intelligent line break. if the current position is located within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), it is not only a line break but also the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Close up & kile within a table environment; the current line with\\\\ with an adjacent line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is smart enough to support pre-set & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be added under Settings Kile; set up... LaTeX can be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables -environments and thus all Et characters (amp;) to each other. while pressing Shift; Alt; amp; search & Kile; after the next tabulator in the above line.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & knot; already provides a good source code completion, this in & box has been extended. there are three different modes installed. these work three as needed and the other two are for automatic completion. all these modes can be set up for different modes of work under Settings Kile... can be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning of a new environment using the\\ begin {environment} will be & kile; automatically added to the command\\ end {Environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input is removed and, unfortunately, the complete list of letters becomes more complete. on the other hand, the list can be reduced by entering a further letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, by & Kile; also jump-marks are added, so that a simple jump to these positions is possible by editing jump-marks Next jump stamp and the desired parameters can then be added.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; set up... boxes; complete can be adjusted to these lists. there can be different Walls for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as wiews of the general language-use can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for complete environments. a few letters with\\ begin will always have to be entered and the call of complete mode will result in a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & kile; a special mode for the complete destruction of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">The command to open the environment is automatically inserted and it appears\\ begin {. after that, the environment can be continued in the simplest way and can be stopped by pressing the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment will be closed again automatically. once & kile; recognise that it is a listing environment, even a first\\ item command is included.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Kile; set up... boxes; complete can be done to these lists. this mode uses the List of Remuneration Mode for & tex; - and & latex; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kipling; support custom lists of heaters which are immediately replaced by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings Kile... boxes can be set up. for example, a cwl file contains the file example.cwl, in which for example the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word 'complete' mode is introduced over the Edit menu or the key Ctrl + Alt spacebar, the character L will be replaced by the\\ LaTeX string.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large stretchers are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been found that many offices are written in a document more than once. therewith offers & kile; the completion for all already written calls.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the menu Setting Kile... to complete the box. here, the threshold for the display of the complete damage can also be specified.</seg>

<seg id="1852">The Graphics dialog allows graphics to be used as simple as possible. to view the basics to the graphics formats, the paragraphs and paragraphs should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as known as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for naming and reordering pages. if the PDF output is used, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted to a PDF file with ps2pdf.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to be able to examine the results of the work, the source code must be compiled. all tools are grouped in the menus in the Create compiling, Creating and Generating View.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source text for viewer like & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used the keyboard shortcut Alt; 2. afterwards, the DVI; file can be viewed in the standard viewer by Alt; 3, using alt; 4 the DVI; file can be converted to a PS file and viewed by the alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the Quick Building instruction, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no embedded viewer is used, a new window will open each time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project is about the project New Project.... This is where the following information is requested for the project:</seg>

<seg id="1863">& tetex; and & textil; comes with a lot of documents. included are documentation for the included packets and an additional & latex; reference.</seg>
<seg id="1864">This is not just a description of all programs (but a few important packages are described) but rather is a complete instruction manual for the & latex; commands contain and is thus ideal for searching for a specific formatting. since this is a very large document, it is divided into & boxes; in three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Due to the amount of documents delivered with those & tetex; / textil; the finding of the right document is not always easy. as possible help offers & tetex; / textil; the small application texdotk, which contains a database with all to & boxes; delivered documents and for a graphical surface area.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the big advantage is the search for package names or keywords. by & Kile; then only the results are displayed.</seg>

<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a part, we start with the Edit Plugins menu. this opens the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all of the included plugins and add new ones. we describe every & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a location & quantaplus, this path is used to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for uniqueness identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the Setze + button. the currently selected member (its identity) appears fat after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of their own identity are important with regard to news and notes. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to the overview of their team, there is another benefit by capturing the team members: an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something is happening. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something is happening in the project. an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project, so later it can be looked like a file is backed up, or a script that plays a file in CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the event configuration page of the Shift; F7 Project Project Properties Dialoges events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the addressees selected in the recipient list. the addressee can be a team or sub-project manager.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">To enter notes is simple. either the note entry can be selected from the editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword is entered in a comment field followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname is the nickname of the team member, role plays a role in the project from the following options: team Leader Subproject Leader Following the area and sub-project leaders, the corresponding area or sub-project names should be given, as in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are independent of upper or lower case, but spaces around the brackets and the name: make the note invalid.</seg>

<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up using Settings Quanta... This dialog extends over a few pages that are treated consecutively.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; concerning tags including car completion can be modified with it. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lowercase of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal Groß / lowercase means the tags are inserted as described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically added attributes. normal Groß / lowercase means the attributes are inserted as described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags: if checked, tags for which the closing tag is optional, will be added immediately after & gt;</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags automatically: as for all other tags except for simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Start and finish date automatically: when turned on, the corresponding tag will be updated and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic setting of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters to the corresponding coding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetyps for the detection of different types of files.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created files or other files opened with file opening (where the encoding of the file can be bypassed). however, this setting is carried out by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been recognized. however, this setting is carried out by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that the document can be restored from this backup during the next launch of the program. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in its own view (or the documentation in a tab), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the PL- and source code view in shared mode. see the different modes.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree representing the representation of parser nodes in the document can be adjusted in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the structure tree settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the update frequency of the tree when editing and how deep when changing the structure tree is to be opened automatically. empty nodes are the blank areas in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s valid. this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the Ifclause Abbreviation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plugins are part-applications of third party, which can be re-used by any part-capable application, the most known and konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plug-in if it is not located at a standard as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is given to the plugin when starting, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"" "load component in" "" "read-only" "" "mode: check whether the plug-in refuses to load the load. only-read Parts usually refuse to load if this option is not selected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is checked, then test & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting has been completely redeveloped. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was set, as well as the support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger plug-in concept was implemented which allows different implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, which adds support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the Debugger plugin for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin select field, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is activated for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. normally appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions. normally appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (like in HTML) of the debugger is shown. normally appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, anything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to debugger, if necessary, is made, or it tells the plugin to listen to debugging needs. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened, which uses a debugger, so that normally you do not have to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugger session Starts the session. closes the connection to debugger or ends the listening according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug requirement. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and send information on the monitored variables as well as the current line. if this happens, while the script is stopped, execution continues.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens, while a script is stopped, execution continues.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger executes the next statement in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger executes the next statement in the script, where it is blended into functions and include if possible.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if there is not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered that is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">This dialog allows you to enter a variable or set a new value of a variable.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work of Keith Isdale as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a & kde; front end and a part of xsldbg which they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many other works of Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can and quantaplus; adapt to your needs and how to help & quantaplus; help get better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document Type Editing Packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to give support for markup- and scripting languages as well as & CSS; they enable & quantaplus; capabilities like car completion and node trees to make. their simplicity and flexibility makes from & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two ways, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages respectively & CSS; and TagXML files with extension .tag. tool bars are handy, symbolic links of image buttons (above the editing pane) that insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">Tag XML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day shows. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars enable fast insertion of tags in a document without a risk of a write error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they only contain the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders carry the name of the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tag XML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags but contains nothing else than just element type.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The tag type is a script function. when used, & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for class class class. the name of the base class for this class. (family only 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only applies to the type method. specify the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2005">When yes, the day has a common attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to any other day. (family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text into the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. additionally, there are further tags describing how this attribute should be displayed & etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Returns the source code used to fill in the tag editor dialog and the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; will be used to reach the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that assembles the elements of a list together. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can happen only once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each and lt; label &gt; tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be specified. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a day. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Whitespace affects nothing, but make sure & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, and & lt; text &gt;. this will not cause a leg break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is at the top of the & quantaplus; start window and select TagXML. a further dialog will appear, its simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available yet. currently, checking is performed only when loading TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 tag XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 tag XML file. in this file, a & PHP; upload function is described. the filename of this tag XML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tag &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "function" status = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tag &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD Edit DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = User 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD specification. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be created by setting actions... clicking New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The keyboard shortcuts assigned to this action. by clicking on the Custom button, a keyboard shortcut can be assigned; with K1, the current keyboard shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful type of action. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited), which change the document or use as input (or parts of the document), can be started. examples from & quantaplus; even the quick start dialog or the various see in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way, & quantaplus uses: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / from the document name removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with PID of the running & quantaplus; process. if by & quantaplus; only one instance is running, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; from the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above listed methods, a script can input & quantaplus; at the default input. in the input field input can be determined what to send to the default input.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">There are two types output: normal output, written to standard output; error messages, to the default output. it can be specified, what should be done with the text written on the standard output by setting the value of the output selector:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary for each group to create their own toolbar. in given case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the pop-up.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts the editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use it, select "Edit Tag" dialog when available to allow input when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol, that the action is better represented, we will use & kicondo; select from the & KMenu;, Graphics Other Programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels as standard, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size to others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the day start, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green will usually be interpreted as loose, starched, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will indicate that clicking this symbol will add a & lt; startdate; tag will be inserted in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it must still be connected with the action. this happens via the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. besides the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, so it still exists, or confirm with OK to finish.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separators into several groups. open the toolbar to set up dialog using Settings Toolbars. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like a quick way to access the Konqueror Preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator supports grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar has to be tested by masturbating all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After NeweXML does not exist, it will be created imroot folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust its toolbar (s) to be loaded (will) when a file is opened from the appropriate folder.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; -documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in the & quantaplus; repository whether someone has already done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = your description for these documentation e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = func2.html tag2 = tag1.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; documentation so:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntac.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known boundary for the box depth (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing, but make sure & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">For example, when writing a function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help the documentation should be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (context list) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of Context-separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc simply to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc / doc.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information such as which documentation were used to the & quantaplus; repository for use by the & quantaplus; community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the outgoing resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by e-mail to friends, partners or anyone else. at different points, there is an e-mail menu item, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all others & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions are reviewed and only made available if our team uses them as correct and useful for publishing. to make a contribution, we recommend that the source of resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for your private gpg-key after your passphrase (the passphrase is not saved), or in the case that you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the dialog New resource, the input fields must be filled out (URL Preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), upload tool bar toolbar, and begin in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examines and quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing. in case of problems, it warns and it can then be aborted. if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed, a message appears with the indication of the resource of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in tag XML format. there is a simpler way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD Load and Convert menu. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to be used. then the following dialog will appear:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions line: the string that is in! Doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd to appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine tuning of DTEP after conversion: if enabled, add & quantaplus; after converting the file descriptionrc; editor, with the details of newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. to be able to understand these and to take full benefit from & quantaplus; therefore, one must first familiarize oneself with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts without their understanding and quantaplus; little benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the work area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available to anyone who uses & quantaplus; everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to anyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which is the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the cartons with information and the toolbars. please insert in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tabs with the right mouse button in order to receive a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all file tabs, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, jumping to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the Editor area leads to another context menu regarding the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), edit the file under the mouse pointer, or open the file if the string is called a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus; the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bars is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; insert into your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. now you can insert the data for that exactly inserted day. if they want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow you to navigate to & quantaplus; to navigate, to open and roam them. in the representation with tabs are available for files, project, templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, upload or deleting the files from the storage media can be done with the then displayed contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, an entire website & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates are available only for the appropriate user and templates in projects are only usable in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. clicking with the left mouse button lets you access the available information to a script. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one displays the internal structure of the active document. by clicking an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right clicking an element, a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, it can quickly change attributes and namespaces. the entry system, aligned to the content, allows to change all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development. you can download prepackaged documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added, edited and viewed by project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window can be reached via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed indicate all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The toolbar buttons are extensively expanded and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbar is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar Archive over & kmail;. if you receive a tool bar in an email, you can save and load them in & quantaplus; like any other.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; files on your system. therefore autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting & quantaplus; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also you should make sure that is not an older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH in front of its bin folder. the same goes for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE desktop. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; a standalone, extensible markup language editor would? well, this would make it the absolutely greatest Web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer restricted to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now already well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for that the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be captured that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community based. & quantaplus; following, in good use of free software, the idea of Why developers, what someone else has developed, but it allows users and developers to expand and quantaplus; so to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by program-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More detailed documentation is available with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and looked after by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, with the oldest entry being taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. look in the section on templates. should they attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts the special characters to & HTML when inserting from the clipboard, so they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as a formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard to & URL, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s is. first and foremost to insert & URL; s used in the anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switch off the block selector. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes directly to a line number. this is very helpful when your & PHP; -script outputs error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Search a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you can see the display of script actions and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Removal and switching of the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with entries Previous or Next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear grouped in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from disk. & quantaplus; projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows for example, to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project is managed. in the chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions must be added by setting actions... Add tool bars are saved by toolbar buttons, or you will be asked when you exit if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete it from the disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you will be asked if you want to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows uploading tool bars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; you or anyone else has made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be refreshed without updating the whole & DTEP; if this is global and does not exist in the global KDE folder, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag creation dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activating or deactivating the intelligent inserting of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; inserting by tool bar is denied when this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plug-ins are listed under the above-mentioned menu items. click on them. click on an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on derkate; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line-ending identifier. very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms for development. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; with the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries the switch can sometimes need time or cause unnice graphics. it is recommended that card card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode that corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open sub-window. selecting an entry will enable the corresponding subwindow to be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Enables displaying the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog will affect any application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Aligns the behaviour of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate; you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar, or add which can be added and the sequences can change.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the mouse pointer's environment, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high-quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project, developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, as e.g. after completing the project name, the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can later be adjusted using Shift; F7 Project Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering Name, file is filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you enter the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the remote host's setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates for the project are saved. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the tool bars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to add files from the local file system to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content that you would like to download and modify. in case of serversal scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Check if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project will be included. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook it up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder are displayed and you can make an exact selection according to coupons.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This displays a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hooks or, by removing the tick, clips out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be changed in the Project Properties menu in the subwindow profiles or modified using the Shift; F7 key shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders possible), which are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to above, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read in more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the debugger to be selected. currently, only Gubed is supported. more information on Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the sub-window profiles, upload profiles (see in) can be set, as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile, by creating an own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can disable event actions and add, modify or delete events. event actions are executed when a previously defined event occurs, such as saving a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project that was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project menu or the Project Symbol Project open from the toolbar. the Project Properties dialog will appear and allows selecting a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantaplus; changed files will find. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing and open with... in the context menu available with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if there is only one profile, then the button is blinded to prevent removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forgotten at program time. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the disk save option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-loading profiles can be created, so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should select from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or danger. use them at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so that it cannot be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plaintext.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, that is, by simply changing the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened, opened, or deleted in the Project or Project Toolbar, accessible via the toolbar's toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows the adjustment of & quantaplus; to your own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, tool bars are in & quantaplus; it is best to use the toolbar buttons. use and add differ. adding toolbar buttons is discussed below in the Adding toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the icons can be set either by context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which with New Action, a New toolbar can be created, which results in the dialog where you can specify which actions on this or other toolbar can be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries add action and edit actions that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings Toolbars... and set Settings... Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically factual skeletons, code schnitzel and files to link. & quantaplus; you can copy, move or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in example the limitations you set for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some templates provided with & quantaplus; templates delivered have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents by links (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be of any text document type. on the basis of these templates new documents can be created. typically, more specified documents are written in appropriate subfolders. you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in a proper way to be efficient.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful when not creating a new document based on a template but the same text area again and again in the documents. you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are found in template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and choose File As Template Save As Local Template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has happened, you will notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. check the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File Save as template to save as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can simply be dragged and dropped onto the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. it can be used for all file management functions, such as drag and drop or insertion into the konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in project files, you can select a folder on the right and choose a site template, enter and back up a name for the template. by default, the project folder will be saved, but of course it can be saved as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates provide a very goal-oriented approach. you can set headers and footers or dynamically with & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. additionally, you can keep an eye on some things while using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / templates / Quanta / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, right-click on the folder and select Properties in the Properties menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three types previously described; files, text or templates.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the default folder view. if a root folder is set to such a way, it would generally disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. if nothing appears, one is likely to be in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows pre-set or copied text for templates in this folder. this could be general header lines or footers for all templates for a particular project and allows to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers by copying content templates into a folder with special headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, the context menu (pointing to the right mouse button) has a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one location to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; provides two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & Source editor that can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -Page and a cursor appear. then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor where necessary changes are made in the VPL; editor in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document that contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP; to edit it, the source text editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first, except that at the same time the changes are both in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor is activated, this mode is already active, this mode activates the active cursor from one window to another, while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor can be set up via Settings Quanta. after choosing VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation can be set in addition to the interval. generally, the recommendation: a small gap for fast hosts and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so you can choose tools document properties. this allows the editing of invisible tags when working with the VPL; editor. this is used to reduce the manual coding. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document yourself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. Meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword Keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of shaping the pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the Meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style sheet by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is possible as in a word processor, by moving with the arrows. under rare circumstances the cursor will behave strangely. the mark works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and by using the back button or the distance button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way across the toolbar, as in the source text editor. it is to be noted that inserting tags before inserting tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded with text, each other tag must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as tables assistant or lists assistant are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; work, in this release, the tables or lists toolbar buttons need to be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">In contrast to other styles for style sheets, the search for certain elements is possible and the style of the style sheet can be pursued.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. why so & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made a lot of changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed exactly within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare quickly text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it into one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and at the same time displays the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other one distinguishes itself in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both of them differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder chub3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Open dialog allows you to manually insert file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Through the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons and merging of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, for B and C a folder, then use & kdiff3; the file name from A in the other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is enabled, the input field becomes active for target and can be edited. however, it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting with the merge / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. you don't need to select any files in the Open dialog, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it across a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the thought behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you would first have to create two corresponding files, they in & kdiff3; load and then compare them. now you can copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can't remove anything from & kdiff3; only the drop down of text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while over the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, one can see in the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files. this is to be seen in the next section (merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + +, for example, white signs are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows. if the line break is enabled, the line is dotted with broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the title output:, the filename and [changes] when you have edited the result. usually, it contains already text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons Springe to the next solved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, any difference at the same time is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the group will be highlighted and the first line of the group will be shown.) This group will then highlight the current group. it will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and on the left a black bar appears.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes by automatic merge or manual editing no further line remains in the group; then it is displayed in these lines of text & lt; no line in the queue; displayed. this text appears neither in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you might copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; conflicts of merge; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy this text from the result window. carefully proceed with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources to ignore the options numbers or ignore ignoring C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, page on, page, beginning, end, Ctrl-Start and Ctrl-End, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the output window, you can also use the other keys to edit. by inserting -key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as explained in the Conversion and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-image upstream / Ctrl-image off) or to the next / previous conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the selection to the clipboard, you need to copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Paste). if this option is checked, whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copy is omitted. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally overwrite the clipboard contents.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line feed character\, and Win32-based systems use carriage return + line feed\\ r\. Kdiffusion keeps the line ends of the source files so you should not use & kdiff3; also not using binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of last used files will be saved automatically when loading and restored at the next start. (setup Menu Settings - &gt; Kdiffusion...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with a fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences will be displayed in italic script. if the selected font doesn't support this display, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered astert.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press Enter or Return, the return of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is checked, each selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copy to the clipboard will be omitted.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line end type you prefer to store. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step white marks can be ignored. the second step does not ignore each line. in this step white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a carriage return character '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of one line, while others save only a line feed '\'. however, if this option is checked, the back-up characters will be visible, but like a white character. during merging, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis numbers and corresponding characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective for complex and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before jumping on to the next unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white marks are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time, then use better the Choose A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter on the scanning of folders and executing a merge. see documentation for directory comparison and merging for details.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, the original version will be attached to the suffix .orig. if already such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further fuse.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapt the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you must & kdiff3; quit and restart to make the change active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language there is set globally over the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set for each entry separately. if you enable this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">A short notice of what the local encoding is on the selection fields for the encoding. (this can not be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this will affect how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually configurable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding to be used to save.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they may not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the default command can only be used with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Disable this in order to suppress highlighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ignore C / C + + comments are activated.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences between two of three files will be displayed. however, sometimes you just want to see the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; & gt; C or B & lt; c; C will appear next to the normal still a second oversight column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply stop the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click will merge the merge and use the filename of the last source file as preset name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last file used will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor that exactly matches your requirements. you can use this function, for example, to cut off annoying parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed on to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command has also been specified (see above), the output of the command is used only in line sequence. you can write your own pre-processor that matches exactly your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user greater flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">*\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">The\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may begin to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiffusion. but it is good as an example for a further pre-processing command for line equival. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so quasi deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl. perl -p -e's / regexp / replacement / SCHALTER 'However, perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for displaying and merging. other operations will only change the data that the line-comparison algorithm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you are using a normal preprocessor, the newline pre-processor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The pre-processor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences you may inadvertently detect certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the suggestion before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate cohesion and display the simulated changes without actually performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the File dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, Folner1 is used as a base. if no destination folder has been specified, use & kdiff3; Folner3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not the merging. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folders, a small message window informs about current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders, only the files that were compared to that point will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is finished shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the + / - click on the object or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions: fold out all subdirectories and fold up all subdirectories with which you can open or fold the folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the comparison window will be started and a comparison window will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the type of file in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the Details Pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge action is started, you will be informed again about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is identical even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then also folders have the same color. with folders, the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green, then yellow and later, when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same type of file (e.g. if a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of file (e.g. if a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The Synchronize mode is active when only two folders and no explicit destination folder have been specified, and if the option directories are synchronized. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action so that afterwards both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B; copied directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and select new file instead of merging (unsafe) enabled, then examine & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the same date, then an error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical.. While such errors are not eliminated, the merging of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, one file will be executed after another. you'll be finished when merging is successful, and according to other messages when something unexpected occurred. if merging is completed, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the Setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis, Kdiffusion will display additional columns. these contain the number of unresolved, resolved, not white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not specify a destination folder then it will be used as the target in the three folder merging mode. B will be chosen as the target in the two folder merging mode, and A and / or B will be used as the destination when synchronizing.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder should also be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that may be skipped in the folder structure. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merging / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keyboard shortcut). to merge only the current record, select Action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the conflicting file types still exist invalid merging actions, a message appears that indicates the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the options passing, simulating and breaking.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window will open (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select / continue / continue the directory merge, or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, an appropriate dialog will appear. then proceed & kdiff3; its work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">When & kdiff3; encountered on an error, a message appears and detailed status information appears. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem. so you have the option to select another action for the entry, or solve the problem in another way before proceeding with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, these entries (in the current session) will not go together again. even if merging has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered completed. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The settings menu of & kdiff3; (Settings - &gt; Kdiffusion...) has now a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the given pattern are displayed in the elemental tree. multiple patterns can be entered. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid wildcards: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elemental tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elemental tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would be ignored by CVS too. many self-programmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder specific can be set with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hidden attribute. in other file systems, a previous dot will mark a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the elemental tree or not. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When the option is turned on, symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is turned on, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the links like normal folders will be treated and recursively searched. (note that if the option is enabled, a link to a folder containing a link on itself would lead to an infinite loop and & kdiff3; crashes down.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that do not contain any text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it might be faster to compare just the modification date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain amount of security.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the change date. no real comparison takes place. the files are considered identical if they are equal. this can, for example, be useful when copying the modification date. please use caution. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enables syncing when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that afterwards both folders are identical. also, the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, the copy of the newer file will be suggested as an action. (this is considered unsafe because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified too. you should check this in any case.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version will be renamed and will get the extension .orig. If an old backup file exists with the .orig extension, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merge of individual files, not only the merging of entire folders. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merging view remains visible during the merge of individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want it, you can switch the Folder & Text window option to switch off main window in the Windows menu and switch between the two views by alternating between directory and text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merging. as soon as you save the result, the status will be deleted and the file will not be remerged once you start the folder merging.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you re-read the directory: directory -Menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. Kdiffusion uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things you should consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, esp. &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes using the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can't be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then one file will always be accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change date. therefore, the permissions or change date deviate from the original. (note the option Confidence of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start Kdiffusion, press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select In Kdiffusion 3Part displayed from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally requires & kdiff3; two full input files. if it is applied as part, assumes & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then boot & kdiff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror, you can click a patch file and select Preview in - Kdiffusion Part. note that this does not work if no of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; executed as part, it supports only comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in Part mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">There are already tools with the name KDiff and Kdiffusion. in addition, the name Kdiffusion has already indicated that it can merge like the diff3 program from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I've been using GPL programs for a very long time and have learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or want to go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from sources and probably not informed the configure script to KDE. in default configure installed in / usr / local, but then KDE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are first treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line will be treated as not identical.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor remembers for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra one own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort required for this has so far been too large. you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to edit larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src has been defeated; appeared and the text can't be deleted. what does that mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; use & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use Kdiffusion on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of recent changes under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde, use the following command in the basic folder of the & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir specifies the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">As & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should not have problems when compiling. however, if difficulties occur, please report on the & kde; -mailing lists of them.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) copy to the clipboard and delete the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) add the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position or replace the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to re-read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also leads to the fact that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they will be missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present), they will be removed when clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a thumbnail of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on work surfaces, change their size, quit or move them. this works both inside a desktop as well as several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on desktop and at others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both inside a desktop as well as on other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & kpager; clicked, the context menu has only the two entries Pager set up... and exit. if, however, click on an application inside of & pager, the context menu will also appear and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, maximize, On Desktop and Finish. the commands do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows within the & Kpager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is checked, the names of the virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field lets the & kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is crossed together with name, the names are provided with Ordinary Numbers, & eg; 1st Desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is checked, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the field.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is checked, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the window. otherwise, only empty spaces will be displayed to enable them to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with their default symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & kpager; main window can be determined: classically let & kpager; in a 2xN pattern, all virtual desktops appear in a horizontal and vertical line in a vertical row, which is very well suited for viewing laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with their contents. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & Kpager; and then select selector switch... allows the dialog Settings to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment this can't be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vice versa. if you do not have any write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or log into your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & Kpager; part of the kdebase package, you need a functioning installation of the basic KDE-packages.</seg>

<seg id="2480">& kmag; is a screen loupe. you can use with & kmag; a part of the screen as if you read a magnifying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo. this application is interesting for different users: this includes artists, web designers and people with a visual impairment. this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of & kmag.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new functions. it is optimized for use on low-performance machines.</seg>
<seg id="2482">The main window of & kmag; shows the enlarged area of the screen. the image shown in the magnifying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as the drop-down window below.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting, & kmag; the area around the mouse pointer like a moveable magnifying glass. alternatively, you can & kmag; cause a selected screen area in the magnifying window (select window mode) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid the mouse cursor to be displayed in the enlarged window, select the setting mouse pointer. please note that & kmag; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default node; / Qt; -Mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse cursor in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifying window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the & Shift key or the & MMB; use it, you can move the selection box.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer, save it to a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts / stops the ad update. stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (Very low, Low, Medium, High, Very high). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a select window will appear. the selected area will be displayed in a window.</seg>
<seg id="2493">& kmag; automatically uses your set short commands to save files, opening a new window, printing, reloading (using the button document again in & konqueror;), enlarging and reduction & etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2494">Also known as & kmagnifier; is a screen loupe. you can magnifier and magnifier; to use one area of the screen, as if you look at the small print in a newspaper or a photo. this application is useful for different people: from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click once the mouse cursor persists for a while at the same location. it is intended to help people who suffer from the repeating Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain. furthermore, it can emulate the dragging with the mouse. this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can bypass the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, due to the mere moving of the mouse, pain may also be caused. if you suffer from pain related to using your computer, you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic relief devices, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and executes a mouse click once you break the motion briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Moving the mouse, it waits until the end of the movement, before releasing the mouse button is executed. in this way, you can execute dragging with pressed mouse button. this allows you to drag the dragging with pressed mouse button. the intelligent moving requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool.</seg>
<seg id="2504">When Intelligent Relocation is enabled, the shooting time is activated (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button wait, before releasing the mouse button again, if no moving of the mouse happens in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">This movement is stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, when & kmousetool; the first time it is started, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound appears delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the response time. go to the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select there sound system and here the rider General. there is a slider sound buffer, which you can set to a lower value to shorten response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">When this setting is selected, & kmousetool is started; at each start of & kde; started. this function is currently only available under & kde; available. for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to launch a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the user, the settings will be reset to the stand after the last pressing of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first of all with the presets. in particular, you should leave the smart move off. if you have got used to the automatic mouse click, you can later accept the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware at which places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window, which do not represent a link, does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick in doing so is that you do not just clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to take the mouse ball out. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear quickly when you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you'd have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can easily scrape the dirt and dirt with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you use the intelligent moving, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you can perform a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and move the cursor to another location.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor where you want it. but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to have it. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbar and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent moving, but I don't manage to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Intelligent shifting is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is very likely to mark text, copy it to clipboard, or execute any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Don't use the smart move if you just start using & kmousetool; select text instead: run a mouse click at one end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this is repeated every time you click & kmousetool; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. later you can use the intelligent moving without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool, the XTest extension for & X Window needs to be installed. this should already be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer persists. this program has been developed for people suffering from the RSI syndrome and causing pain to those of the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to have a certain time waiting for a pulling process to begin before releasing the mouse button. this way, drag and drop can be done with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text is edited before being sent to speech dispatcher's program. they are useful for improving pronunciation to replace misspoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and speaker, or to circumvent specific shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the functioning of filters, it is important to know how the program speech dispatcher works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other applications and stops them. if the output of the screen reader is read, the stopped jobs are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after issuing the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the next highest priority. a message breaks normal text. & Portsmouth; is an example of an application that sends messages. while you & eg; a long text read on a web page, you can talk to & kmouth; notifications are also news. read more.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order you send from the card card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text jobs. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts which do not have any particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues except for Screen Readers. when an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one such preview, this output is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text assignments as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there can be even more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Placeholder Replacements replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. it is delivered with predefined string player filters, which allow the creation of chat emoticons such as: -) by text or for reformatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable way.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use an XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert and XML; from a format to another format. included in the delivery of & ktts; are some XSLT files for translation of & XHTML; contained in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speech selection filters you can send orders to a speaker depending on the content of the text or depending on the program sent by the text to & ktts. if you have set a female voice on the card board speaker, you can read text from KDE messages about it. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules after which it is applied to a voice output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, it will continue the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktts is sent, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page. processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of normal filters set up. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and will not be used. filters are executed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and you will see the next setup dialogs below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the establishment of string substitute filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns. if these patterns are found in the text, the text will be exchanged for the corresponding substitute text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name in any way, it just has to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column matching and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column. the list is executed in the order shown from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list from a file, the entries from the file are attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter will only be used if the speaker for the text order speaks one of the languages listed here. you can also select multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl key at the click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separately by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID of running programs can be obtained with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; -numbers have to be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copy-3432 shows, you may only type copy.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replacement filter is applied only to the text, if all conditions with an entry in the box do apply filters when matching. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>

<seg id="2678">The xsltproc User Language program is used to support SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc using the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile, you need a recent development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later), including packages of kdelib and development files for the speech-dispatcher program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have the source code of & ktts; from the source code archive for kdeaway or downloaded the tarball currently created every night, compile and install the program using the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use & tts; first check whether speech dispatcher works correctly with your voice synthesizer. to do so, you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of speech-scheduler; the program kttmsgr should be developed in such a way that speech dispatcher is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is broken down into individual sentences. the user can go back punctuation or paragraph, let repeat, pause or cancel the output.</seg>

<seg id="2689">Some voices such as MultiSyn voices require several seconds because of their size. if you select this check box, these voices are loaded at the start of KTTLED, so that the first set is synthesized faster (with greater memory consumption).</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or forget to click Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window kttsmgr will be displayed at the start of kttsmgr. otherwise, only the icon kttsmgr can be seen in the system segment, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>

<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other applications and stops them. after reading the screen reader, the received orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next highest priority. this level is important messages such as & eg; processor is subject to hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Messages have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & Portsmouth; is an example of an application that sends messages. if you have just read a long text on a website, you can talk to & kmouth; nevertheless someone who just enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text message is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen reader, it adds & tts; the audio output to queue.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional detection filters (SDB filters). SBDs can start reading text into individual sentences. this allows you to quickly start reading or stop the first set, since only the first set has to be synthesized, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">At the first start of & ktts, a set-level detection filter is automatically set up as a default. you can change its settings or add further puncture detection filters, but beginners will not be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn is to select the speaker selection by trying out. turn off the speaker selection and select text to read. switch on the choice of speakers, change some properties and check how the choice of the speaker is changed. of course, you need to have more than one speaker, otherwise the filter will be ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then start faster with reading, since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">If the voice synthesizer does not support this function, you can pause or cancel text messages on the card card.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal puncture detection filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set Level detection Filters match text with a regular expression for propositional ends and insert a tab character (Decimal code 8) at the set limits (tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the standard propositional label filter keeps the punctuation.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters will never be applied to & kde; messages (notify), warning messages, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the standard set identifier from default, you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ sbdrc contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card selection card you can overwrite the speaker settings for the application. the card card will be displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top on the card holder). in other words: no microphone properties are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker, which has all the features of a speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & ktts; select this speaker. otherwise select & ktts; the speaker that best matches the originally set properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speech characteristics by clicking on one of the buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select here the characteristics of the speaker you want. if this feature doesn't matter, enter nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property should have priority over other properties. you can also set multiple flags here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since language is a critical factor in the issue of output, it is always treated as a primary feature. you will rarely use this feature. the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is available if you know that a particular application will be sent text in a different language than the default language in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To delete all the features in the speaker area, the most likely to delete the following, click the Default Monitor button and then use the speaker which is most likely to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr crashes immediately when it starts. I have compiled Debug support, but I do not get traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashing and running; you probably have to register GStreamer. if the problem is not solved by GStreamer 0.8.x, a non-compatible version of GStreamer is installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application. if I stop a text application, it freezes & ktts; one. on the console, a message appears that says: unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, there is a problem that conflicts occur at ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have invited an additional voice for festival from the internet. I have installed it and can use it in festival, but kttsmgr doesn't show that voice.</seg>

<seg id="2751">In order for this to work, the program must be installed sox and be discoverable by the environment variable PATH. some Synthesizer module such as Festival Interactive offers a setting for speed even on the card board for speaker system. depending on the chosen voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">(this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; to & XML; (see) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML-converter filter, and set up the speaking speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage websites being read with a female voice. I have set up a female festival orator, but & ktts; reads the web pages with a male voice.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetwork.dll;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; which allows management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & controlcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetwork.dll; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After the installation a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; displayed. the module network settings (knetwork.dll;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & network Network Settings in & KMenu; start.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetwork.dll; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to enable & knetwork.dll to display the device at all and allow the setting of the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and set up when installing & Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module is loaded when the Network Settings option is selected in the & kcontrolcenter; Index. when the module is started, it tries to automatically detect the used platform on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which corresponds to the distribution and the Releasestand. by selecting the setting non-re-questions the definition can be hit permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are displayed gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, the change is not possible. in the system administration mode, click the system administration mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be carried out by the rider network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The Network interfaces displayed on display can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button... in the Device Dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The automatic mode selects TCP / IP settings from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out at the same time with the start of system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information on every system start, so no further setting is required.</seg>
<seg id="2812">The manual can be used without dhcp or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration. in the IP address input field, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is checked, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are shown as the properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address on the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the network console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be enabled or disabled according to requirements. switching on an switched off network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface...</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off depending on your needs. turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the host's IP address in the local subnet, which communicates the physical connection to remote networks and is used as standard for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the computer asks http: / / www.einedomain.org then DNS will resolve this name to an IP address such as 123,45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be placed in the list by selecting an entry and adding or downgrading in the list with the Hints or Herman buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the Add button... from the group calculator to the name resolution, a DNS server can be added. the Add New Name Server dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to name resolution, select an entry and then click on the Edit button.... This will display the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of names known by name describes hostname-to-IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used when booting, if no DNS servers are available. in small, remote networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list of names in particular contains some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. this still in the test version of IP should replace version 4 in future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add.... Add New Alias dialog will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button. if the known host has multiple alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name known by name from the list and select Edit.... The dialog known Calculator will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be done one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkcon.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installing binary distributions (mostly rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a software console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not only, but also the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile and compile the following commands.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, and in the second, all of the configuration files changed by & knetwork.dll may be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section does not replace any further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about integrating the PC into a small (home) network is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv4 has never found any big dissemination. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. therefore, this description is currently focussing on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned. in external networks, at & eg; Workplace, the network administrator is the point of contact to assign a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up an own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks of up to 250 hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all computers are participants in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.027; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the default route is required for IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface that works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part you will find the configuration files that are affected by & knetwork.dll and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed in DSL connections so it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections there is another content to be found there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand than expected can occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which furthermore provided the capability of dds2tar for fast, selective packing.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be integrated by & kdat. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; train the tape back and read the pre-tensioning information of the band. recognize & kdat, the pre-tensioner on the tape does not, you will be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & kdat, the header, searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if this is not found, you will be asked if the band index should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything goes smooth the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been mounted. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by unfolding the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; gives a change to the symbol for the band that the integration for the band has been solved and shows in the status bar a corresponding message. the band can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band can be used by & kdat, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A tape drive must be formatted before you can use it to store data. if your tape drive requires formatting of tape before use, it must happen before you can format the tape before use. floppy disk drives usually require formatting of the tape, while DAT drives are not formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and capacity, continues & kdat with the formatting of the tape. all data on the tape is lost thereby! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you must select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only save this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Save...</seg>

<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu item Check....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure is started, the dialog appears for verification. in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the working folder for verification.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you confirm the verification settings, the dialog appears to check. this dialog displays the progress of the review process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can reconnect, the files to be recovered must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive entry. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Recover in the menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process is started, the Settings dialog appears for recovery. in this dialog you can check your selection again and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you confirm the restore settings, the dialog will pop up. this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recreate the band index file using the tape contents. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the currently selected folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed in backup files, only the files in it are backed up on the same filesystem as the folder. folders located on other file systems can be entered separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independently of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Performing an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings in the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to device file for tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmitted & kdat, before the tape is mounted the command mt load to the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try & kdat, to lock the ejector at the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, the tape is automatically disconnected; the tape is automatically ejected. do not use this option on floppies.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is on, try & kdat, to change the hardware side block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must inform & kdat, in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat, a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is the hostname: seconds, with the hostname being the full name of the system on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time in which the band was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information on problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& kSystemlog; helps users understand what your computer makes in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified display of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users can quickly access information about problems that arise on their server. & kSystemlog; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & kSystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, provides & ksystemlog; functions available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystem log; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - to open. if you do not see it, and it opens up instead of a small message window, so you have & kSystemlog; most likely do not have access to system administrator rights. the protocol files usually find themselves under Linux in the folder / var / log, for which normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or by entering strings. in the default setting, the list box next to the filter will show the entry All. then a log line will only be displayed if a string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course also select another entry at this point. for example, the string of the filter search term will only be matched with entries in the selected column. for example, in the log file system log, select the name of a process, then show you & ksystemlog; all log rows sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more noticeable color as protocol lines of level hint. the colored representation of protocol lines can be disabled settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (for example in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the launch of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the main window context menu, in order to display all new log rows that are added.</seg>
<seg id="2953">To use this feature, use the entries in the Windows menu to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& kSystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more up-to-date information on the Sources of & kSystemlog;.</seg>

<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and also named so) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">System V Init quickly became the standard for the control of program start-up when running the system in the & Linux; this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binaries is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine on System V Init without installing a new installation and reformatting. therefore, you must make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.d. There you will find rc.sysit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for each system service you want to start when running the system or switching to another run level. system services do not include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls are according to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file even if there is not much use for it. you can also set a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel selects in different places after the program init and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. in the beginning, you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can edit / etc / inittab manually and change the 3. if you have messed up something together, you can fix it by restart the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script will be invoked with the stop argument. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument boot argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server running level that can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user -runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or other pointing device is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it at this level (or to stop it).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move the script between Runnig or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. this will only be removed from its original runlevel (or position). this will only happen if they pull out an entry in the field of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you move them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new Runlevel, you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the contextual menu and paste them into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorter number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorter numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different work ranges (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it into the clipboard by cutting it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired Runlevel with pasting (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the sort number or name of an entry, press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to preferences are saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard Runegs and now the machine is constantly starting new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default running level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplifies the configuration for the proprietary implementation programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not conform to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check that all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service (and whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) just quit without notice, if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel to allow it to be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter customization of & kuser.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes you have to save it. either use the corresponding toolbar icon or the Save In menu item.</seg>
<seg id="2992">The main window consists of two tabs, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group by double-clicking on the entry. it appears the user and group properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some maps will only be displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have configured space restrictions (quota) for users, a map will be created where you can customize individual settings. if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card will appear in the case of Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd as installed in BSD domains.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if, for at least one filesystem space limitation (quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here parameters can be changed for each user, with the space limitations of each file in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current filesystem is selected using the File System field with space limitation</seg>
<seg id="2997">The tabs group informs about the group affiliations of the selected user. the default group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the field Primur Group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. edit or delete the selected user or group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO Selector, add, remove and change boot password, change time to boot of the default operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
