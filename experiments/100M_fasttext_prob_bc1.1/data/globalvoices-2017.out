although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can L@@ etter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous plot of an oil @-@ magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the US .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love letter about its size .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much was written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , as he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never thinks behind the mountain , as you say so nicely .
he says exactly what he thinks , like a former colleague puts it , and openly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , the people have responded to his statements and voted in favour of him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections was the highest number a candidate nominated by the party ever reached .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the Journ@@ alism Programme , who receives people from all over the world , a deeply beli@@ ever person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung agreed not to agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at play .
Tr@@ um@@ ps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who struggles for life long the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like their son .
she still adapts to Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es &apos;s commitment , which always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Le@@ aks , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump re@@ marked his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out however that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the argument with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they either shared his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
maybe it is unfair to describe the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as ra@@ cists .
to arrange the people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and suggests an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that those voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to raise a man looking down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( NB . ) : &quot; like the white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities , &quot; pu@@ n out white in all@@ usion to the white and whi@@ plas@@ h , as the big Van Jones described , has killed exactly what America has done so splen@@ did@@ ly .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have , America means everyone welcome .
for this land chose as its president twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ man whose story , as he himself says , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge portion of the white American that promises and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this , I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of his election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd responded with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your Americas ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is Tr@@ um@@ ps Land now , the news said .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find any place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish .
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca in common with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
the fact that the music played in both places has not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with garbage
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a big garbage dump , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists , but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for several years now the La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( musical ban@@ ger ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and ban@@ ker violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth so a rare gli@@ mmer of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
as soon as they get out of school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they come always smiling and with shiny eyes and play in the hu@@ stle you learn day by day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pani , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ manufactured instruments made of local solid waste materials are produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the leadership of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all of which were made of garbage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , rec@@ alls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in tr@@ ash . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a piece made out of tr@@ ash .
today there is an entire orchestra playing instruments made of re@@ manufactured material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of garbage every year .
those who live with him and him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
fill harmon@@ ics follows the orchestra with its inspiring performance of rub@@ b@@ ish @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played its music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that op@@ poses wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practiced solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the shared use of content .
in West Africa it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia &apos;s waters before it searched the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a law@@ break@@ er of this kind on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles have quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u rec@@ alls , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan F@@ ish@@ eries Authority . he is part of a team who discovered and persecuted the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia , because of the pl@@ under@@ ing of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries ) .
the members of this network are alongside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that had driven the prime minister from their waters back then .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries which are like @-@ minded people and work together . they exchange information and stand at each other where illegal fishing is concerned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to track down . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing in regions .
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing legislation through which certain habitats and species are to be protected can damage the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once imped@@ ed by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also by the sn@@ ail stamp , with the information circul@@ ating between individual countries , the actions nowadays occur in real time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on suspi@@ cious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , suspi@@ cious cycling routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship transports its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal record .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then , on the basis of this information , refuse to accept such ships in their ports . which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm which supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated $ 20 million in lost revenue , which the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i lose every year because of the illegal fisher@@ man who inv@@ ade East African waters .
East Africa is one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region is attracting commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include , among other things , activities such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , ph@@ ant@@ asy name , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ interrupted control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &apos; You cannot run my port &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the closed front has so far been working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of suspected ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed counter@@ f@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found fle@@ eing ships .
due to his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international crime control authority , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and preserve information on illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspect ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , helps to detect the illegal ships that are willing to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this we try to cross , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers technical support F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that links different levels of information . F@@ ISH @-@ i is supposed to help to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the NGO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform , together with Google and the Oc@@ e@@ ana marine protection organization , a platform that provides satellite data and is able to display the position of each tracking ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with neighbours to get a better picture of who &apos;s doing what - that &apos;s simply meaning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project that allows a global system to prosec@@ ute ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only det@@ ecting criminals but also deter@@ ring them .
ships that had been f@@ ished without a license and hardly expected to face consequences will now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i meanwhile have a 33 % increase in fishing sales since fishing boats are buying more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track down Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets where they were forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars are lost annually by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
six countries have joined forces there in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are also comb@@ ating illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . . &quot; safety is the goal of making even more of such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia sign@@ alled its first major triumph : in October , there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was on the road under false flag . and not only did the ship travel without a license and were used tra@@ w@@ l nets that are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded into forbidden waters , reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working in the entire world sea .

their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; rec@@ ap@@ turing the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are in protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the im@@ pe@@ achment of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
this picture of María Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the opposition &apos;s motion to a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into void while congreg@@ ating on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the regulator of Venezuela ) you can find pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
the debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - including in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions of Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central north of the County of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is steadily deterior@@ ating , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the im@@ pe@@ achment of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but in the end the reluc@@ tance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence rate is among the highest in the whole world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum held for many as the only way to give the country the chance to re@@ conquer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance , Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Unit ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces to support the majority of representatives of the opposition in 2015 , and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , was planned to continue on November 3 .
the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :
it is so far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday country @-@ wide civil strike and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .
continue to say ! pic@@ .@@ t@@ wit@@ ter@@ .com / 9@@ Zy@@ V@@ G@@ ld@@ N@@ ry

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
the first demonstration in the frame of the action programme &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the pictures of the Mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and pro@@ pon@@ ents of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most shared pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Venezu@@ el@@ an cri@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter there are pictures that talk about disputes , as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
particularly large waves hit the news of police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the prot@@ esters with@@ drew into the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement in front of the police and armed pro@@ pon@@ ents of the government .
hours later , they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear a skir@@ ts , because otherwise one could see something that many National Gu@@ ards do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already shows the extent of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an im@@ pe@@ achment procedure - this was now proved in the eyes of many by the presence of inn@@ um@@ erable people on the street .
my@@ t@@ ek &apos;s Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado argue that 1 % of signatures are fake .
here is your im@@ pe@@ achment !
on the road !
others regard these protests as another step in the struggle against a government that has taken a little against the devastating economic crisis from its point of view and pre@@ fers to refra@@ in from taking critical voices :
they took us so much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike rather than work or go shopping .

this is an adap@@ table version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take part in the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of Cor@@ doba .
now as an adult male , Qui@@ j@@ ano said in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cor@@ doba against his father .
the trial ended on 24 August 2016 , with crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the secret of his family .
in the situation at that time I thought it was al@@ right .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turers and a mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ ie . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
they all called him K@@ ent .
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have befri@@ ended one of the ERP .
just give up that they will not kidn@@ ap you one day and I &apos;ll have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , the revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the Military Arm of the Argent@@ inian Revolutionary Workers Party .
so he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me that I would become a magi@@ cian .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be al@@ right .
on the base of the military base I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

the prisoners are tor@@ tured there &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
on the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ rack where cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - were simply everything possible .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great l@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen objects were placed and kept me with a guard post .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
over there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I sp@@ ed in and saw a couch where people were tor@@ tured .
it looked like a field bed and metal feathers .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied there .
she un@@ le@@ ashed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , flooded it with water and hun@@ ted him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was terrible ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I never could forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied and bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
he spoke with &quot; Chu@@ bo &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying with the face down - all were tied in hands and feet .
near the entrance , people kept quiet on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told them at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero attacked and killed a man there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to reports from survivors , Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process , beaten the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the memorial La Per@@ la , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the path on which the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came to be laid .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen stuff .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as it called it - was .
but when I was at the military later , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military cra@@ y@@ ons that you take off an enemy whom you fought .

but when one goes into a house and ste@@ als the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... it is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could take part in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you who steal the cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
so my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
when I testified in the process , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ t@@ len@@ eck jum@@ per made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but still brought clothes to home .
at that time , the defense was acc@@ using me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to testify .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ ses is the last vile act &apos;
now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have executed people during the dictatorship . but why do the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why children kidn@@ ap ?
one day my father brought a girl to the house whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have been put into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why would their bodies disappear ?
didn &apos;t these people also have families to whom one could hand over their mortal remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a human being .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but anything remains of course .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought of showing my father was during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him blame for all the atro@@ cities I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly amazed and wonder@@ ed why all the exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they supposedly defended were actually good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me about that ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Just then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I saw the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can reproach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age .

the sentences in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera Process ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims eventually in August .
43 Rwand@@ ans were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences of sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the originally 54 def@@ end@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ per@@ la@@ enge : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ War@@ terrorism
all def@@ end@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped along with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling is an historic milestone for all human rights organisations working for the victims for years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process lasted more than three years , but the research for it lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government sur@@ rendered the country on which La Per@@ la was located , in order to establish a memorial , which is now run by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes elderly people in K@@ YO@@ TO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error in a centre in Kyoto where one can extend his driving license .
the photo was circul@@ ated in the social media .
adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving licence , witnessed a particularly mis@@ erable translation in the last month .
the Japanese word ( kor@@ ean theor@@ bo ) , which means &quot; older drivers &quot; - was wrong@@ ly translated as &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ ori@@ sts . &quot;
the incorrect translation was to be read on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself from September 1 to 20 .
adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in social media .
the mistake appeared to the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also the one who drew attention to the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , a daily newspaper published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that nobody has read the translation corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and simply unacceptable in an international city such as Kyoto , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bad English translation was removed first . the term &quot; terrible drivers &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , although gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct title &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture was ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported on the ap@@ ologies as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by the insufficient correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News made a little more detailed dealing with the phenomenon of &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; elderly drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of elderly drivers who are involved in accidents across the country are quite a cause of concern .
in the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 deaths were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 , which corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
the notably non @-@ known repor@@ ter published comments on the light published on Yahoo &apos;s article , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to have against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo over the translation error has , among other things , the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How defective the translation is actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as their mother tongue to translate into English . this may be due to a lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons , or the relatively low number of English native speakers learning Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees themselves , still make translations internally . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made for the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences which arise from machine translations show that this technique can &apos;t replace any human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English phrases in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic prints that often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but by large corporations or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
hopefully the city of Kyoto will use a more serious source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
main page of the website &quot; Nav@@ al@@ con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible .
other online transm@@ it@@ ters made recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by opposition groups that oppose the government of Nicol@@ ás Ma@@ du@@ ros .
the protests began at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was cut and advised the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet .
# Zen@@ sur : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again disabled .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offerings such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reluc@@ tant to report on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
I signed up with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net without cable TV and informative national TV channels .
it is astonishing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ Z@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which DNS servers respond correctly to certain domains .
if an Internet site is blocked by DNS , the server rep@@ lies er@@ ron@@ eous or refuses the request when calling such a web site .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ le capit@@ ol , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , the transmission was suspended on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV c@@ amer@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who transferred the protests into Car@@ ac@@ as , was det@@ ained .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also been informed that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , making dental vene@@ ers more difficult to access multimedia reports on the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today T@@ ina is fighting for the rights of children and collecting testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ don@@ tas , who became victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a structural report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation from the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house proudly said about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old she began to work as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay , the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school are called Cri@@ mean tas .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money passes their under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , more ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that children do not have to pay for many days of house@@ work , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for several years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ mean tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is in@@ oc@@ ulated by the Cri@@ mean delta is generally not silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , whose daughter is in the belief that she can complete her training , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out of herself , &quot; is transferred to another family .
on the other hand , the family who assimil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies the exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that wouldn &apos;t otherwise be educated and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will experience it many years later .
sometimes they never know of it .
in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon that takes place in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of severe be@@ atings . shortly thereafter she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military family Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3.000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra attacked Mar@@ ín as long as he suffered le@@ thal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ p@@ son .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela bl@@ amed the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the girl &apos;s death .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people gathered in protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be &quot; no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; more cows are registered in Paraguay than children , &quot; said T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers , it is much easier to inf@@ ringe the rights of children without imp@@ unity .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a rapid investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o to be sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ mean .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be pioneering - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes in court .
the daily life of a Cri@@ mean
the Cri@@ mean tas are exploited not only as labor power , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the calf in which her father worked , had to en@@ roll in bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked in her employer &apos;s house between four and six hours every day .
she had to share the time in such a way that you still have time to learn .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
on Fri@@ days , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the sooner it was finished with learning , the more free time it had .
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the house &apos;s library as a food out of the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
on some evenings the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them not to believe the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent , but did not talk to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while he spoke about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I was going to learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her masters feared that they would lose the education that they had allowed her to lose again , she explains .
but she was perfectly clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
also at school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken are bul@@ lying and the har@@ ass@@ ons exposed to cri@@ p@@ pling when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ m@@ son .
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to my home . I had no friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships are created , I felt particularly clear that I was not a member of any group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which you can share vac@@ an@@ cies for cleaning staff and girls in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administrator is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and afternoon .
to learn .
please feel free to contact us .
starting Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .

bill proposes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians recently voted to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regul@@ ators for use and benefits of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if adopted by the Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up , which is tas@@ ked with allowing citizens to give permission to social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months of acceptance of the law , users must be registered on the site of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a fin@@ es .
the bill consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video messages and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted , as the draft gives no indication of how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose registration to the users who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation on the level of social media enterprises .
Ri@@ y@@ ad@@ Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and Sup@@ por@@ ters of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Senior Research Techni@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) at the Egyptian initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot; &quot; &quot;
I doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take it seriously , it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and safegu@@ ar@@ ded that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; Ra@@ o@@ of says .
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill of law against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was provided for those who are found guilty of threatening public order &quot; and &quot; to protest &quot; to protest . &quot;

high up in the Kur@@ dist@@ an mountains in the north east of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the NGO Nature are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of the Leop@@ ards , who ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ op@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , they are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of wild , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find always less boot@@ y .
why is this particular species of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and flour@@ ishing of the ecosystem also depends on a big pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard actually in the wild is small and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a big cat in the camera trap , R@@ aza shoots out in sheer joy .
as a bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza likes to show passion@@ ately a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies for wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring that protective zones for wild animals are set up in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

early March 2017 documented the progress achieved for North East Japan , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress achieved over the past six years in order to re@@ construct the lives of those affected by the &quot; thre@@ ef@@ old catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a real pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast that had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ecture have been ev@@ acu@@ ated as the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map .
in addition , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture has experienced a nuclear accident , which alone is why 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
from a local point of view , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics from the Japanese reconstruction authority as well as survey results of those affected .
housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( s ) were completed in the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recorded the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light by 70 percent .
at the same time , six years after the catastrophe , the ev@@ ac@@ uation of the shel@@ ters &apos; shel@@ ters ( that is , Kaz@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) is to be reloc@@ ated to final substitute @-@ houses .
after the triple catastrophe , almost 80 000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes .
almost 40 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated ones from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma were still living in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated homes , which were lod@@ ged after the disaster in temporary shel@@ ters , were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses .
the figure for I@@ w@@ ate is 34 percent here .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ecture
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial re@@ building in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident caused extensive involvement in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of agricultural land , with only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of the land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma destroyed by 5 400 hectares are located in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely , but again Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is far removed .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 per cent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can exhibit only 75 percent here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to be able to determine the overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ated ones .
in her introduction , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents found that still not enough was done in matters of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es .
how it is about those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper strengthens its attention also on the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the tremendous earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness of the worst , disa@@ strous , atomic accidents that Japan had ever witnessed .
nearly 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture of 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
at the beginning of 2016 , more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been res@@ ett@@ led into permanent sub@@ stitu@@ tions .
after the 2017 stand , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside of their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in disaster areas , most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated ones are older than 50 years old . they are well known because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are building projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people from other countries meet who speak a different language , the differences seem to be larger than the simil@@ arities .
however , after a while , one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva in a widely distributed photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer had killed him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ ya with a strike on his head . millions of demonstr@@ ators nation@@ ally took part in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the German University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on this Saturday and now put him in an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local picture journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures , the police officer &apos;s face was also visible , who attacked with a bat@@ on . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police reported in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service until the end of the investigation .
the pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ da@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen on television for six months and the whole repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ eur@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ ya , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the web in which one can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ e@@ dic@@ s shortly afterwards ha@@ sten to him .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family , who lives in another state , Internet users now have donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the costs of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ ana while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further acts of violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás has experienced a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , because he had been sab@@ ot@@ aged by an occupied school with a gas leak . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a stick in his face .
police Hand@@ les
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only State in Brazil in which brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators occurred last Friday .
police officers set up protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the Euro MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) asked the police to refra@@ in from violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media covered street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo focused specifically on a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their titles with a photo .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a brand @-@ set bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more on a broken window pane than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly opposed to any form of material damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets an absurd and dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on the confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Vill@@ ages For@@ gotten from Ent@@ in@@ du@@ str@@ alization in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba concluded the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular congregation of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ ab@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site .
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ sed .
after the fall , the sugar cane industry remained quiet in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the framework of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and commu@@ te daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active period are in operation again because they were obtained .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene rec@@ alls specifically to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane mill would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administration decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the municipality already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity . 155 sugar cane mills were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 published report &quot; Agricultural prospects &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the de@@ commissioning of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents agree : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they constituted a full @-@ time working group .
the first letters began to come before the first half of the year .
these were officially recorded documents , which were distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all of them were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was re@@ port@@ edly and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was in charge of the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane manufacturers still in operation , &quot; he says .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved against his will at the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 work years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important working de@@ generating set has been wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , no alternatives were created for the work places and services that the plants were generating in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know if during the M@@ amm@@ ut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president saw in the eyes of the persons present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the folk congregation Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said , when they began to mi@@ tig@@ ate them , they also stopped to asp@@ ire the street , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with an advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without any prospects for the future , many young people also left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created whose production serves not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ eso per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a follow@@ er person , yet he does not forgive the lies that one told him .
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
N@@ ene is reti@@ ring at 65 years of age , not because it lacks power , but because it is em@@ bit@@ tered .

first Nations young@@ sters use hip hop to express themselves and get their own culture
a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo taken with permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
young people of the First Nations communities throughout Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do this via hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e hip @-@ hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop thus lear@@ ns that the young participants explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young@@ sters are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the territory of the tribe of the Kit@@ h@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; a section in Western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to medi@@ ate how important the preservation of traditional customs and habits is despite the influences of global@@ isation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages even though the young@@ sters do not always speak of the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation added , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved received a little help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ script as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day you will hear our cry
because as a youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and also move forward with our youth
so they can do what they have chosen the Creator
in the comment section , the reader and advoc@@ ate of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a contribution and adds the verse to Sil@@ en@@ ille ( which is also published on his blog and re@@ published here with permission ) :
in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( imp@@ ec@@ cable ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu are displayed near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) of each dish served in this restaurant .
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
there are a large number of small companies in the Tat@@ ras district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend turns them into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ omas , the blo@@ gger has published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new mobile tapes decorated with plastic trays as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have turned into kit@@ sch coll@@ ec@@ ti@@ bles , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new boom in food products is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case an ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) has been transformed into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as a mobile phone stand .
we also made this part of the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple attached to your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design .
and this is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some cell phone stand and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or nit@@ rous oxide is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anybody who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with laugh@@ ing che@@ at ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members un@@ pleasantly .
our latest cell phone stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands of dried salmon .
further bizarre plastic dishes can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the city of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry , for example with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking , &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics , but they do not at all reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every cor@@ p@@ se , behind every bone find find in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never heal .
that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico founded the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , which tells these victims a voice and tells stories of people involved in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project in this way :
organized crime can not only be feared for our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the P@@ ain of Vic@@ tims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear@@ ful life changes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells us exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews in just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we are preparing for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October , he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th , he should be back , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me too .
at the moment she has no income .
you stand up to the insurance of my father , but it does not pay for it , because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where shall we get that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a veter@@ an of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I &apos;ve known illness and sensational journ@@ alism for several years now .
every day I pass by newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the title pages with images that can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is reluc@@ tant or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different to this or consider this to be normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) when he is big . and it is not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
the in@@ som@@ nia of people is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified by being &quot; de@@ pressed . &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they do not move and remain silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four @-@ month black@@ mail in the main town district : how a family was pl@@ under@@ ed with threats from their business until the end not only destroyed the business , but also tore up their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain of it never passes , the trauma stays , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also have changed .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when to kidn@@ ap or kill you .
in these terrible days I wonder@@ ed if tears would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega has published the paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , fry potato , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every age of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood had passed by two years before when he was just a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloody cor@@ p@@ ses of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looks like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as a force ma@@ stered by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world based on the number of mur@@ ders , according to the Government Council for Public Safety and the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor had 3@@ 103 deaths . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; animal Pol@@ í@@ tico founded the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , whose goal is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the past four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this article and the pages to which he links contain images on which violence is portra@@ yed .
the fact check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to illustrate trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; false description &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; false context &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant careful coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images on news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank truck tra@@ vers@@ ed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people lost their lives .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected and devast@@ ated for years . the roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to drive .
tra@@ gically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to this .
officials described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses including a cin@@ emas near that was full of people watching the soccer world championship .
houses ro@@ uted and char@@ ted cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to infin@@ ity .
a picture with the title &quot; Das belongs Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident depic@@ t the horrible scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ coal bodies lined up on the floor while persons are looking at them .
but here the story doesn &apos;t end .
over the years , the same photograph was written several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed real but not related trage@@ dies , particularly occur@@ ren@@ ces in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye witnesses dras@@ tically reported atro@@ cities they had to flee from .
houses and stores were burnt down and bodies were buried in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one was left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one inhabit@@ ant of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
the follow @-@ up time could only be illustrated by satellite images .
the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt by B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of false supplements ; Africa Check has documented supplies to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a privilege for mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely fal@@ si@@ fy the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the picture taken from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly prosecution of Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning report , published by the United Nations , those who were able to escape pun@@ ches , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts appeared like the following , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an aci@@ dic news page , which was fal@@ sely claimed in 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein , said that monks and politicians were involved in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the picture from the DR Congo to share this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations , who called AF@@ P their source , had also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein Sein , but did not have the picture taken in connection with the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false cas@@ ings go back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can exceed boundaries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) that are very similar to the mentioned picture from the DR Congo .
they come from a mix of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have re@@ directed false reports , some have tried to expose for@@ geri@@ es .
we have included examples of the ab@@ u@@ sive use and associated them with the respective countries on the basis of which page they have been published . this way we want to portra@@ y the range more clearly than by language alone .
several examples of mis@@ use can be derived from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also have been linked together ) .
here are some cases that can now be completely sen@@ sed ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News frames .
country examples of incorrect connections of the image from DR Congo to Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications .
the countries in Gra@@ y are examples that , according to the metadata and information available through Tin@@ Eye , are likely to show off fal@@ si@@ fication examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a link to the picture from DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Iran , 2012 .
a German association of the@@ ology ( mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the N@@ asi@@ m news agency and used to illustrate the picture of the DR Congo .

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo taken from the DR Congo was given as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of the ab@@ u@@ sive use of the DR Congo image , on the one hand a tweet that expresses sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to del@@ ude the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being used , since the photographs are mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a right to judge what they &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately fin@@ alized news and photos , which came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings on Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this correction , which has only been published in English , also contains links to fake images of rum@@ ors that are used by H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to explain that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often dis@@ semin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a bu@@ g@@ nosis of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bu@@ limi@@ a disease &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a presum@@ ed problem ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this post , which addressed the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the picture of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims killing Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page wrong@@ ly claimed that the President of Myanmar was admitted in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained therein .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news page An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , now deleted by the Catholic Church , has explicitly stated that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar &quot; jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was put into circulation later in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the El Pa@@ is newspaper tried to dispro@@ ve that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ and@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world is asleep ) .
the picture of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massac@@ res of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events , which took place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saved ) , but the messages related to it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a ho@@ ax .
from the message in which the picture from the DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ers mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated .
there are further confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the Fol@@ der in Gra@@ y ) , Tin@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image files in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Musli@@ u . )
in all these cases , which appeared significantly after the original piece of 2010 , the picture may ultimately describe a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and Images
there are two strong themes or frames that pass through these posts . the first frame focused on religion .
the photograph was used with regard to greater discussion of the silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the mur@@ ders of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is important both . therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens if readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are tens of people who inad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy .
does this mood of mis@@ information and mis@@ information suggest that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and the real horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the distribution of violent images has already been widely deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . at times , these images are even demanded of the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent pictures are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing readers and viewers and taking the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study which investig@@ ates how violent media is acting to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons used according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( irre@@ plac@@ eable ) tries to offer voice enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to translate .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( such as the famous Portuguese Saudi ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish Sob@@ ota ) .
but everyone stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand precisely what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while .
most of these lists handle Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find for example words from the Mw@@ och@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - get your parents in recognition of how you have been striving for you in your younger years .
and words in the Hun@@ s@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after warming yourself in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes , how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page would like to publish even more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are .
speakers of the Treas@@ ure Languages , which are highly valued by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite songs here .

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slide disaster in this decade .
initiated by the mon@@ soon , which is normally employed by the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ la@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya came across the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to a statement by the Sri L@@ ank@@ an disaster of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly 100 people are missing because of the floods and slu@@ dge winds .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and around 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places of residence .
the rainf@@ all occurred on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
the health and hygiene conditions of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ding in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates on the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods ag@@ grav@@ ate the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on their way .
today the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus arrived in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water p@@ eg@@ els of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five are made for the transportation of emergency supplies for the inhabitants trapped in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ ing@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 today if you need help in this area .
the call @-@ call @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ op@@ enz@@ entrum will be informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me has launched a &quot; flood control &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . they were then sent to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by floo@@ ding and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka where multiple social media platforms are fully utili@@ sed bring residents in need of security and provide assistance .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I took part at the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
I entr@@ ust her to her four year old daughter , she entru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in one minute we still call slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next , we add rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are located in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the i@@ con@@ ian image of a woman with a head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , others chant slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have been familiar with me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; who have built themselves up in their imagination .
they ent@@ ail me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all put in the same one .
this pi@@ ge@@ on@@ hole is so well constructed in our collective imagination that once Muslims , as I do not fit in there , are ab@@ used .
to be dem@@ or@@ ised
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you get in mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the western conception the religion of Rum@@ is was er@@ ased , as well as from the most popular translations of its poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a great deal of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims which have been col@@ oni@@ alizing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid er@@ ased the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images still stand forth today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ er them .
I worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen these powerful , flaw@@ ed narr@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US did not even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this narrative fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and Saudi , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body that these are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mighty group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative we@@ aken Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has st@@ aff@@ ed our collective imagination in such a deep and flaw@@ ed manner that Si@@ kh men and children often become targets of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ings .
because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the other .
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rations which help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed f@@ abul@@ ously to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed to find out where seven million Muslims represent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ Israeli Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

approved use .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan was re@@ covering the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ willing Muslims and Americans .
but am I now an absolute Muslim and an American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of extrac@@ ting my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs that all Muslims bear in themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ p@@ ah W@@ utz . &quot;
I jo@@ king , we don &apos;t carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be chosen for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ vers@@ ed Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for false information , which have manipul@@ ated our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger that tears a woman &apos;s head@@ sc@@ arf .
or as the terri@@ fying card of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its most ug@@ ly forms sei@@ zes our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity , which is so broad , so versatile and complex that it cannot fit into a drawer .

approved use .
I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but being a Muslim was only then born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a temporary mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : belief , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf see that I am Muslim if she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air separating our houses .
she would see the ritual with my daughter when I held her in my arms and whis@@ pered the Arab verses to protect the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim belief is always part of my shadow .

approved use .
belonging to me is the image of my grand@@ mother on mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; as she decades ago , she won a contest for the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi .
it is the image of her that I will see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete paintings of painted Su@@ fi saints ; and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book of one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers she told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that - for centuries - was col@@ oni@@ zed by an &quot; Empire , &quot; a company with the name of hon@@ orable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dia @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie founded it , has a deep meaning to call God , my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
approved use .
belonging is to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cri@@ es .
in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan cried out over his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , a family that he was not allowed to close in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by colon@@ ists who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; col@@ oni@@ zed &quot; all to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first pilot bom@@ ber of history was thrown off a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , caus@@ al sub@@ tan of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

belonging to my Muslim trunk of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous story .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed across every continent , apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , have gone to Iraq to hunt weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy asks the US and the susp@@ ects we@@ ars a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first call for prayer called Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slave .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people over@@ crowded the airports to fight against Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ages , but fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of 1.7 billion bears more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ er , but is represented in the reducing duality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
being a mother means caring for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people er@@ ect structural Islam hos@@ tility on this duality .
structural Islam hos@@ tility consists in the Muslim registri@@ es , which began with President Bush and were extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration li@@ aison officer , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that closes its borders towards people from precisely the countries that bom@@ bard them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ Fly @-@ List &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the wars that we lead and the bombs that we reject on Muslim lands .
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically correct image and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims received the least score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations That We Have To Lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply involved to include Muslims or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back decades to recognise the roots of our fears and the flaw@@ ed and dangerous image prints we perpet@@ u@@ ate in our news editorial departments .
at least there is a growing movement headed by American Muslims in the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history with hy@@ ph@@ ens .
the Pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; S@@ ay Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print more Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super @-@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global time point we are in .
and this moment has consequences beyond 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ ori@@ sts who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally , because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years before , she had not yet given her ; now they have ma@@ stered large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history of which I was un@@ aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who today made me become an absolute Muslim .
things I have left here like a bread@@ cr@@ umb in my speech .
things that may evo@@ ke memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that constitute our humanity may l@@ ur@@ k a story where someone is being made to another .
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations are taking place within the context of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics discuss our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or that we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why I &apos;m telling this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are w@@ aged and people are dealt with by creating the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation , four decades ago even scientist Stan@@ ford was himself .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions on the role of being aware and un@@ consciously the &quot; other . &quot; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because of the fact that we had no president , the chocolate cake , while he already bombar@@ ded broken countries and &quot; other &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban linguistic diversity
stor@@ y@@ telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of Treas@@ ure Language stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the insur@@ moun@@ table blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of languages of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already held events since 2015 , the risk of small and not so small languages is not passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the cre@@ ators of the project :
the mass ext@@ inction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to it often connected with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; purpose these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to appreciate , to make sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers will first present their story in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers , their devotion and their presentation will lead to the fact that the audience sett@@ les on it .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotion , as if the language no longer has a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ du@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us tells the f@@ ables of the rab@@ bit and the Bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his parable , John Ny@@ am@@ us is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad smile , he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico calls for re@@ establishment of sovereign debt from the USA
with the goal of a revision of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took place at 72 million US dollars , several religious and bourgeois organizations took part in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 ; the march started at the South African Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da . &quot;
the advoc@@ ates of the re @-@ establishing of the debt have also filed a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico are calling for politicians , bank@@ ers and government officials responsible for debt to be held ac@@ coun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a line committee without personal interests in public debts , with a fixed , our working conditions appropriate remuneration that acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with dec@@ lining pension payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - the territory of the United States , not incorporated into the state alliance , is suffering from a severe financial crisis .
for this reason , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state view .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without the participation and conviction of the citizens , measures imposed from outside will run the risk of being rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration bore the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night Gu@@ ards for Light and Truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Syri@@ ac @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue to campaign for freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on digital culture , hosted in Berlin , dedicated an event to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , a publisher of books produced in France within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective Inqu@@ iry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective Post @-@ Research ) .
the book published last year and is available free of charge , contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is an homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge , and what is the real cost associated with it .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ m , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been det@@ ained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was painted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was lod@@ ged on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information whatsoever about his current state or place of residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book titled &quot; Coll@@ ective Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce &quot; gives his friends and his family a voice that is pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us are beginning to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what have we decided for ?
what have we given up in this process of sometimes extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in charge of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military tri@@ bunal from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 who claimed themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his residence and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and at the moment the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prototypes was more for@@ esi@@ ghted than the work he began with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civili@@ s@@ ations and here Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he started working , the IS would make everything possible to wipe out this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but of the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent all my life dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
he taught me English , even when he was in prison .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he has taught other det@@ ain@@ ees to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other det@@ ain@@ ees how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a commission she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
she s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available free of charge .
envelope by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is happening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens every time you visit ,
that I s@@ unk in the world of your won@@ dro@@ us eyes ,
that I lose sight in the moment when we embrace ourselves ,
that each of the dangers is clear to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , fet@@ ters and guar@@ dians
I forget the prison of the prison
and I enter every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes are saying good@@ bye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to rec@@ laim all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ sels &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests against the Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
by 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in detention since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we reiter@@ ate our call today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambique : Director of corruption due to corruption
Moz@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger to a sei@@ z@@ ure of corruption in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence , in which corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and together with four other def@@ end@@ ants was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ end@@ ants .
the money came from public funds from the Moz@@ ambique airports , whose Council was Chief Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re @-@ election to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic who rejected the request , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to rel@@ inqu@@ ish his old post as the company did not perform any disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many inhabitants do not welcome the action .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish its director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that even the company should have initiated disciplinary proceedings against the re@@ fut@@ ed .
however , the company apparently remained silent and did not take appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contradictory &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant , after being sentenced to a prison sentence and half of it .
he could give paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could consult and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
re@@ fut@@ able !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director has no moral :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because it insul@@ ts him . I can &apos;t believe that you are rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so massive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za is lacking mor@@ als and serving the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served themselves in the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself became we@@ ary of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ us@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic Red@@ ner .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man was able to sell , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that this is not the case . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reactions were also negative in Twitter :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was 10 years of age and was free .
and today , the company , in which he exp@@ els funds , puts him under contract again . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Stat@@ utory Fra@@ ik@@ ul ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) 12 May 2017
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo from the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( German : @ truth ) states that crimin@@ ality pays off in Moz@@ ambique :

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although it is still discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an &quot; Indian &quot; ad@@ j@@ ective .
Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or of the local ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word itself does not automatically evo@@ ke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word have been cens@@ ored in order to express their use .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings that have the same sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ keeper A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty fashion whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question mark ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before del@@ eting all posts that are suspected of rac@@ ism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ e@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the adjacent words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spl@@ its ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat proved that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new policy by Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post from Facebook was removed and I was forbidden to read , post and share content for 24 hours because the post &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post has been removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community ask for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work .
to cens@@ or such words will bring even more hatred within the different communities .
in addition , it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support , and thus bann@@ ing words such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ a curr@@ y . &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts .
if they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great turnover , it would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has ensured a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t contain hate speech , but were removed anyway :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat a pe@@ a curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
just to try out if Facebook is removing the mail containing the word &quot; Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , the role of hate speech in social networks is to heat up violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where clas@@ hes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts forced thousands to flee .
Facebook was critici@@ zed for his failure to control the prolifer@@ ating hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better , more likely to be looked at in context than initiatives focusing on code and learned from them .
Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago finished with the chil@@ dr@@ ens

the children &apos;s to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law to prohi@@ bit this practice , so that the marriage @-@ ready age is now at 18 .
before this change of marriage , some members held Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 it came to a great public scre@@ am . at that time Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Women &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every man under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were married to 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 girls under 19 were married from 1997 to 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements aimed to aboli@@ sh La@@ dies &apos; laws followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this result .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children , they should try to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition spark@@ ed tensions in this un@@ complicated matter , and at some point there was a question of whether the opposition would agree to the draft bill at all .
however , at the beginning of 2017 , the draft bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent committee that could be discussed - so that a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country has to agree and announce the law .
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave a status update on Facebook , which once again posted Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle to Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ res@@ at : the draft bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and no one against it .
once it has been decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of social media users were thri@@ lled because the laws on inf@@ anti@@ cide were finally changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which has covered the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost any price .
while Abel Jackson was of the opinion , it took me long enough to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally came :
public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , Out@@ standing news !
the marriage law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
following the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , Follow the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) said :
the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years irrespective of religious affili@@ ation .
the amend@@ ment to the amend@@ ment of the married couple was approved today , on 9 June 2017 .
there were 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 were present in the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all Members agreed to have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the children &apos;s to@@ e is prohibited by law in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # shiel@@ ds shiel@@ ds .
many thanks to all activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat @-@ Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hin@@ du organization of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to deliver his promise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users desired to address the debate on the subject differently .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so broad@@ ly , in a way that can only evo@@ ke panic and dis@@ grace , if we , instead of talking about the problem that the state protects our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men , who are in advantage to them , &quot; would you then be prepared to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s marriage is legal or still the norm in different levels , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

by mirr@@ oring websites , Turkish users can look at Wikipedia content
the Wikipedia page was published on January 18 , 2012 , in contrast to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based on Wikipedia .
day after day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series resist the block@@ ade .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using b@@ yp@@ assing tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second best known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirror sites ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. machine calcul@@ ator connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes complete cens@@ orship difficult .
however , the content is accessible despite legal prohibition .
in a blo@@ gger , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after listening to the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we decided to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the contents in a decentr@@ alized and distributed way .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edi@@ a Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edi@@ a was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edi@@ a Italy has issued both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedia , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Le@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar M@@ irr@@ ors if prohibited in the respective country Wikipedia .

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for conservation
a Su@@ h@@ len@@ der Rhin@@ o , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ red with poorly positioned motives and washed colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera with him and to try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal &apos;s animal world to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when I suddenly called me to Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to kin@@ dle pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know it , for he already stood face to face to tig@@ ers :
a tiger can &apos;t distur@@ b the opinion of the sheep when sleeping ! !
late in the evening . light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness on the way home when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ z@@ he@@ k appeared . he immediately starts to see us and he star@@ es at me through the S@@ al trees ! !
&quot; &quot; &quot; to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and lived mostly in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ters at Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations .
see below some of these photos .

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and initially appeared on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version has been re@@ published as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure , and fear of the consequences should they ignore the norm , keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a pseu@@ do court and exp@@ elled from her family and the village community after having addressed a married couple with names .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer permits to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ let in P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , performed a unique club and became the main topic of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and sets up for the disman@@ tling of the patri@@ archy .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ola has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices , such as child marriage and ban@@ ishment of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected people , and manages these clubs .
she tells us how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors for change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was women who don &apos;t call their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem that women could easily identify with .
not to mention the names of their hus@@ bands , is a custom which they all have du@@ ti@@ fully maintained and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without morality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home , as it is running .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this confidence in the baggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini presented a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to get started the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us how they want it means that they do not respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women never have to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she was only ch@@ ick in front of herself ; another decided to release the whole fru@@ stration of him and his family by curse him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ aline rush of having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands at home .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another member of the club decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation resulted in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zin@@ ap@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead that indicates the sp@@ ouses :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would carry the zin@@ ap@@ ian point if he did it too .
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing him .
the other women have not stopped completely , but think they are now in a better position to choose to not wear it on some days .
for many women , the Dis@@ cussion Club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what they hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last few months they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so sincer@@ ely about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to tell you certain things , no matter how small they are .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with clothing .
some women in the group have only taken sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of them it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ one @-@ cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pair of pants ; they did not dare .
after a lot of contro@@ versy and discussion about the benefits of their own choice of clothes , the mor@@ als combined with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini mu@@ g@@ gled her own couple of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ inhibit@@ ors ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini are sure they &apos;ll manage it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly rolling :
so far , we have only made small steps up to now .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped telling the name of their husband .
some of them , including me , do it , but only when they are alone and not other members of the family .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the Dis@@ cussion Club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as sliding around more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult @-@ to @-@ navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first visit to Japan by the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official Beat@@ les YouTube channel .
on June 29th this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag of the &quot; Beat@@ les Memorial Day &quot; was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the Beat@@ les visit in Japan in 1966 is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post@@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , marked the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here have quickly become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail@@ er Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! . today is the Beat@@ les commem@@ oration day in Japan .
also today songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools .
the Kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les Com@@ mem@@ oration Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pupp@@ et John L@@ enn@@ on should represent or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the familiar places associated with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , that &apos;s your 5 places you absolutely have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lan@@ e
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be qu@@ ir@@ ky enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les Com@@ mem@@ oration Day .
exactly today in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran on Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course some companies use the fan community in terms of market conditions , such as the R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! . today is Beat@@ les commem@@ oration day .
and what could this be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to me today &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat ra@@ ke no@@ od@@ les near Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the day is going to run today .
so , we hope you are there !

bald men are dra@@ gged and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the people that bald men could be targets of attacks in Moz@@ ambique .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of family members for organ traffi@@ cking , probably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , is worried by the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from Malawi &apos;s border .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
there is a local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a man of bald man could contain gold or bring wealth , said the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia on BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the goal of murder for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN Security Council carried out a mission in the South African country in order to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
attention to C@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambique by bald men in Moz@@ ambique are the target of ritual attacks , the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police warned according to the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
hus@@ ky Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police have already followed the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate the riches .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country .
on Facebook Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared the chron@@ ic@@ le of the B@@ log@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulties faced by Moz@@ ambique :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE DE IN Moz@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME ashamed a country in which people would have shame to pursue good marks , and even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for ab@@ hor@@ red purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; would be hun@@ ted that aim to attain fast riches .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunities for mac@@ ab@@ re hum@@ our could not be missed .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ hir@@ oth , and the police spokesperson Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald @-@ headed :
Moz@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of bald people .

a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) plays a key role in expanding public access to the internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our Arab blo@@ gger meeting in 2009 .
in November 2015 , B@@ essel &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that her husband had been sentenced to death , but gave no further information .
Bas@@ sels &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a learned from Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we show the honour of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of open web movement .
and we appreciate the efforts of all those individuals and organisations that have worked for his release over the past five years .
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested by the regime or disappeared by force are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , not less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in custody , so the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o caught attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ment ) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ u case as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man that he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this issue with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to appeal to the international community to release Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some foreign reactions .
United Nations United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to permit a treatment abroad .
Norway and Norway
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and foreign minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ z &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway was das@@ hed after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that ultimately it was nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were only resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after spreading the news that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his award in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union : European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ bor , as she stated in an explanation on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity to treat abroad , in so far as he can assist him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
the US Embassy &apos;s request drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement of the Foreign Ministry that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told us that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and liberty , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his election , to which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz also adopted a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally .
I urge China to release Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condi@@ tionally so he can move into a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany and Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokesperson , Steffen Sei@@ bert , wrote on July 3 , Berlin hopes that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese president X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on July 7 and 8 .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had major concerns whether the vor@@ tex of Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China urged China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um says further :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and freedom to exercise these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France and France
France &apos;s foreign ministry demanded China in an explanation on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where he needs . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information whether France will eventually receive it .
Taiwan and Taiwan
the Council of Rural Affairs in Taiwan urged China to release Li@@ u on 27 June and show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to call for political reforms and democratic development .
Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu M@@ ei @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama The Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader of Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed himself very concerned in an explanation on June 28 about Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was strictly punished could have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt personally moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem foolish , as Singapore is recognised at an international level as an independent state .
but according to Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this re@@ mark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed Singapore &apos;s domin@@ ance of the only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries .
he ass@@ ures that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cav@@ ali@@ er@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious country , one hears that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of fle@@ eing from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; in the face of that , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally towns which are permanently guided by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core of the topic , the good old ly@@ re pl@@ ung@@ es from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic because it fits better to their power .
in the end , the responses given over the last week of sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were given to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ responses .
he addressed relevant questions in a rational way with non @-@ responses .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point if he was paid high to be part of the government of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out the critic@@ isms that one should begin to read the entire story of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
please read the tran@@ script .
when he said Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections .
he compared Singapore to cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities witnessed a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , which makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement as leader of a growing generation .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore had said ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard who expected me - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he really believes and is aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the vulner@@ abilities of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have a good faith &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a joy@@ ous spokes@@ man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are viewed only as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , to which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore back ?
Singapore is unique , it is both land and city .
since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but don &apos;t they defend their town ?
who needs to pay bills to our Prime Minister ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the Journey of a Dec@@ ade , for Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , tends to be a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country above all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect about your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ors exposed about certain parts of the world and a different fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question asked me most in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
the standard answer is usually follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans perhaps cook inside with anger when they are kept for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who does not know , there is little that distinguishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans get a Canadian flag clearly visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
the Americans , on the other hand , ... .
so it was already when I started traveling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons at our disposal !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very often . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country in respect of ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
firstly , I have many American friends whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if someone would conf@@ use me with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first , to be called &quot; nice &quot; means to be sp@@ ook@@ y - like the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle yet tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure of N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The S@@ imp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian dual @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing to push .
to be harmless is to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
this can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
thank@@ fully for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau stepped onto the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dies in Thailand &apos;s j@@ un@@ ta
a pop band in Thailand published a music video that par@@ o@@ gues the j@@ un@@ ta , which seized power in 2014 , and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells the prescri@@ ptions about his girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not politically , the music video still indirectly refers to the continuing military rule of the j@@ un@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation in the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
in the first three days alone , the video uploaded on Facebook was shared 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes .
last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the j@@ un@@ ta rule .
take a look at these recordings of the video , which refers to some of the political topics that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which grants absolute decision @-@ making on important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change of imagination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered critics by the Jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army to monitor online content and to prosec@@ ute people who were accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
Thailand employs a strict law against &quot; read Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic insul@@ t ) .
martial law was proclaimed in Thailand on 20 May 2014 .
two days later it came to a coup d &quot; é@@ tat of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money is unnecessary .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before bringing them into intern@@ ment camps , another problem .
some journalists are in prison , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; which was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost towns in eastern Asia Minor

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society pi@@ cks up very slowly in East Asia Minor , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ bot@@ an war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shakespeare , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ í@@ ava are located in the coal @-@ basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups , like Russians , Greeks , Dep@@ u@@ ania , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians , lived and worked together to Soviet sites in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today the majority of Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
during the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people after barely one decade .
in 1989 , approximately 43@@ ,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ ch@@ uk@@ ov@@ ka , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are in decay and very rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha village I met a native elderly man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , it is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens that all served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded glory @-@ buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha there are about fifty inhabitants .
approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which still accommodate one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed home .
when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother for@@ ba@@ de us to let ourselves be photograph@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was simply forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence farming ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal consumption ) such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable growing .
it is difficult to get over the l@@ aps .
in winter the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina hasn &apos;t left Asia Minor to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will stay forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly rentals are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if holidays are , we will visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we can &apos;t do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she calls to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could cultivate Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s conversation partner Nat@@ ascha , together with her husband and the five common children , lived in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she rec@@ alls the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ch@@ asia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but that will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 child benefit for every child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once stood , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
it tells us that it was initially a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time it lost its anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and everyone lived how it was right for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation ends , a little boy runs past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases after him .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children are now pursuing the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the ru@@ ined buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure authenticity in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it otherwise .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Afrika &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses migrants on their long journey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border from Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bridge frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear shape .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Afrika .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for approximately $ 2.@@ 50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
sometimes , Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez talks , people come into full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they begin shou@@ ting : &quot; Mama Afrika !
where are you in Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cardboard .
she does not want to reject anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy drugs that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Afrika is an appropriate nick@@ name for Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family arrived from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it fits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister , hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Afrika . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Afrika is a well known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declares Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans are often traveling together and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez &apos;s W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his trip to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Afrika is our mother and we will never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send her text messages when they went away to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her labour .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chi@@ ckens like in Ghana .
Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have included migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled Honduras with his wife and his three children from people who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
he asked for an accommodation in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and an unknown person , a single person , offered him their roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Afrika is all again full of guests .
in the ais@@ les , travellers should consult their phones quietly .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez appears to be happy that her house is full but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone .
like a proud grand@@ mother she brow@@ ses in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care that she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly as she puts her in front of me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; you have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message , it is said that the app should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities also called on the app to use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group shortly after they had installed the app .
the police informed that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information , &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app for min@@ ors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in a variety of ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those living in distant , repres@@ sed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit disturbances and dis@@ satisfaction in the areas of conflict , authorities often arrange extreme en@@ grav@@ ings and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ inely Internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlet , &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen asked the residents random@@ ly to check whether they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
you have forced the people to use devices intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the recovery technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( P@@ ack Trust ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can raise the password request of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council to minim@@ ise the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and institutions connected with the Party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office on the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a current Freedom House report , a US human rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , authorities issued a decree to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible off@@ enses , including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane portra@@ ys his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and discover that you are alone in a place where everything important has disappeared .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly identi@@ fiable , both from the inside as well as from the outside .
one that makes all honor to their name .
one that has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if the reality reco@@ vers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the act@@ ress , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters transform into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es out after death .
all doubts dissolve in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even when the earth moves on the axis of evil . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone have erected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have arrested me and my father thri@@ ce , but that was not enough to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
during a peaceful protest , five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to tear the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the neighbor@@ hoods were cov@@ eted , but my own not .
for the first time it was silent , mo@@ tion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a town that is stu@@ ffed up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice resist@@ ing the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me , and we turned to a glorious picture full of my expectations .
at such a moment you are aware that you release the gh@@ ost from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the slightest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military safety building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you have scre@@ amed them all the way up to the security service office .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only cour@@ a@@ geous enough to cry out if we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are really gri@@ eving to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I then did has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was because of my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity , perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my case when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hadn &apos;t thought you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped watching you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement with his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father immediately with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed set still lies in my nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a psychological torture that I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I conc@@ ur all the details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they have allocated a bigger cell to me this time .
I have to share it with only one other prisoner and may set me immediately without waiting for permission .
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the civil servant left the cell and I res@@ or@@ ted to an old proven communication method : beating his fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first fruit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me ultimately .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man , who looks like me and called &quot; Doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , no striking features can be seen on me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive out all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ ored at the fruits of my head &apos;s garden .
from afar , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be at about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ es are heard every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th floor of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to protect the state security from us and to prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ it@@ ors and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ an dialect - thus they played out their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world@@ view .
this is not a house , which is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and stock@@ y man ; at least he is coming to me .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the expressions that der@@ ailed to him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join these Ta@@ ge@@ di@@ vines and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
I really can no longer say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , although I had nothing done to deserve this punishment .
of punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to pull me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the kno@@ bs .
your exec@@ ution@@ er delights in your cri@@ es .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cri@@ es .
my scre@@ ams didn &apos;t bo@@ ther him enough , so they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
at my first arrest , I wonder@@ ed if the investig@@ ator used to work as a waste collector or if it belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to present us those , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
within one hour , three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in the turn .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and didn &apos;t take pleasure in it , which is why he moved next to an electrically charged bar .
electricity flow@@ ed my whole body , enough to supply my whole district .
my half @-@ naked body lying stretched on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which happened to me like minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted adol@@ escent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and go away , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always let me go .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he locks to his screen , sometimes to his computer , sometimes to his couch .
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel accomplished its occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family to escape from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as fel@@ lows ( for example : farmers ) .
for six years now H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist , opposing the conservative majority and ques@@ tioning its well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking , and he can sympath@@ ise with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though he does not admit it openly , he over@@ looks the American foreign policy as a special a@@ version .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , has anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian wing@@ ed second generation &quot; - so he describes himself , even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine before .
&quot; I don &apos;t think so , because of my own circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he po@@ urs in water sol@@ dered Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the consumption of food during the Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness in breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protests against Islam on a hot young day .
in principle , the s@@ lag of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ rons of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose are primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan is like a prison under the open sky , especially when you look at the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - just like drinking water in the public during Ram@@ adan - in order not to land in jail .
recently , the Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front @-@ singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert statement .
the MP and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was &quot; just &quot; cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also asser@@ t that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activ@@ ism which in@@ question the proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la under@@ estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who continue to use &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement might not be just plain rhet@@ oric , but actually reflects an ever @-@ clear cryst@@ alli@@ sing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b re@@ treated traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should trust .
over the past few years , the number of &quot; mur@@ ders &quot; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary mur@@ ders in 2016 reached its zen@@ ith ; however , it is still difficult to say that Jordan is lacking institutional infrastructure in order to support women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a law to fight crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of inner @-@ family violence can &quot; be kept in prison in@@ definitely &quot; and for their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee from the family that nothing will happen to the woman .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known not to shy away from issues that have long been considered tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit all@@ u@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , cannot separate from politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was told politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in the nucle@@ us can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song one verse repe@@ ats quite often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
in the course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians , and that comments on equality between LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were strongly cens@@ ored by 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to note later that his comments were torn from context , twisted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed only a modified version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als is not un@@ related to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ eva , a poet of the eighth century , still today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ eva , who was later to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service adopted several former government officials and members of the teacher association , with the reason@@ ing that they had cri@@ tically addressed the problems associated with the deep @-@ rooted corruption .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a permanent giving and taking . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - that is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , deliber@@ ate and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
finally , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region will be approached by a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions , and arti@@ fici@@ ally induced demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue ra@@ ging and consequently resist@@ s .

uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
another theory states that the solid wag@@ ons , the drums and dancing have been handed down over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies mar@@ ched from west Japan to the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the emis@@ hi , into their knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two solid wag@@ ons are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high solid car was unbelievable .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

external appearance and body care were rare as in this history , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dresser .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for es@@ thetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens go into the seas@@ oned hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers , who can recre@@ ate these complex hair@@ styles .
the un@@ parall@@ eled demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
experts face each other in order to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( see more videos about current competitions on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions like the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dres@@ sers and to receive training in the hair@@ dresser &apos;s art instead of bad advice , which enables them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of you@@ ths have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion .
before the school year started in March , the school offered special educational workshops and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because out of love for the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : letter of love to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel exp@@ elled ?
this is precisely the question of the young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to write to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la Guadal@@ aj@@ aci@@ ón ( letters on reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
only recently was their country the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the treaty of peace was considered so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
however , before the Colom@@ bians , there is still a long way to talk about true reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years , who were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carrying their weapons around the clock , must now re @-@ integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society in turn , accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take in its ranks and support it in building a new life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would have to join together and help in the integration process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ as to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to briefly speak to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more urgently .
he was planning to share his love with people who needed the most urgent response this year .
the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for the former fighters of the F@@ ARC who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; she says .
so far more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo , travelled to the camp to deliver the letters in person .
the F@@ ARC members got up as they had done before to receive orders from their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter brought me through the camp of the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life has anyone wrote me such a beautiful thing , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of the war , was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society out there that wa@@ its for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to handle weapons .
but now that peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
at the start , students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders came together to make a discussion .
the students were all grown up as already in war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice made on the part of the State on all the Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help to shape society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear these people who have never heard heard and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and hated even people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who killed and caused so much harm , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
for example , Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter to Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i :
the Colom@@ bians have been prophesi@@ ed that peace would reign after dis@@ ar@@ ming .
but that is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to resort to arms , to rise and protest for their rights . and that is also totally justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC are now bet@@ ting on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . for those of us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties will be im@@ min@@ ent .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
activists have witnessed the reporting of the recent months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community there is not only about the night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya won the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports were published that addressed the deport@@ ation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ as@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspected tor@@ e@@ ere men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a woman woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was grown up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
out of fear for her life , she moved to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day someone told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while trying to help her , someone from whom I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents , and spread it everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents went through the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App round .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
when I was about to bring out a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned around I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you flock ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I just know that it was a young man , not thirty years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital .
apparently some women had got everything and began scre@@ aming .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung .
OC Media : in which hospital wing were you laid - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out of date , my male name is still on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I first read his name on his office , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for dealing with me respect@@ fully .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they asked me absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by running up without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender , that everything was only bad news , and Photos@@ hop .
I have size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still difficult for her .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has humili@@ ated not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it became too much for my mother and she lay a rope around her neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later stood under the window a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 mag .
after it happened for the third time it became clear to me that something was la@@ zy .
my human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help , I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without registering , without knowing anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it in the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my cell phone .
at the moment I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you &apos;re sure , just because you &apos;ve left the country ?
our people know in which hotel you are in . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about gender equality , this is a tab@@ oo topic .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I desire , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when chat@@ ting with camera , I really care how the person looks at which she rec@@ alls from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : last week I filed a report in Washington .
for him I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who had imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he told us that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not exclude a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
in this way , I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced satisfaction with blood .
OC Media : are gay men still being held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine told me that there were not so many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to put themselves to Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can later be presented as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but pur@@ pos@@ efully immersed in order to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone imprisoned for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there was nothing new since then .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was himself when these people were taken along .
until now they were not introduced as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why otherwise would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already familiar with Gro@@ z@@ ny when I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to bring us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civili@@ sation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , but ultimately pushed us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had tin@@ ted lashes , bore tubes and short tops .
the Ministry of Health of Sh@@ aria has never even bent my hair .
in front of the Russian theater in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
there is a saying in the Che@@ chen language : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to have children funny when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes from you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began talking about morality on television .
he spoke not about us per se , but mainly about the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people in the city started to change .
he who smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at first looked at you with suspicion .
in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came home I was able to feel how the situation in the republic was steadily deterior@@ ating .
OC Media : what activity do you follow now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ins , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I do not tolerate c@@ ents for it .
I discovered these people myself when I cleared the type of refuge .
I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is sil@@ ly .
this is the nature which has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to tell you foam in front of your mouth that there are no bo@@ ils in them .
the Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ es have what the Cab@@ ard@@ ines have , the Russians have also ; on the whole planet there are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
know , many think about transitions to men who love men and they believe that you change their sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide among the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian ancest@@ or region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last months there has been a strong rise in su@@ ici@@ des .
the photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 recovered the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran , characterized by poverty and unemployment , in the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al Tha@@ w@@ ra in the province of Ah@@ ra@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ ra@@ zi &apos;s human rights groups working in Ah@@ ra@@ z and want to remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could no longer do anything .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ bin Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have imposed this month .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and pursue a safe work because of the persecution by the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to deny their livel@@ ihood .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy assumed power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy is still developing only slowly , and the local population receives little of this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime is systematically den@@ ying the Ah@@ ra@@ zi @-@ Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a large number of dam@@ s , which re@@ direct water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are located .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness in the region , and to destroy the local farming as well as the fish and palm industries .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ chi@@ zi people rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ ra@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of secondary school and completed 45 % of university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ ra@@ v@@ ts@@ i .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process .
as officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and for@@ cing them to earn their living outside of their homeland .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ ra@@ zi and be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi had to endure , human rights def@@ enders beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world w@@ akes up and takes notice of it .
the main reason for suicide is depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional don@@ or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should be all fem@@ inists in general .
for example , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men nowadays .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later , and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all of this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I come to speak on skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black women &apos;s women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention the way we have been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to keep silent .
however , they all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to &quot; lift their voices and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about the fact that , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence , which we are exposed to black women in a tw@@ o@@ fold manner .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to the school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of having domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all people of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot join a movement as a black woman who refuses to take into account any injus@@ tices in her mind , which refer to the sex as well as to the skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has always and again rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a dem@@ ented and margin@@ alized being in a historical sense . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation in order to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of bl@@ ending skin color and gender . some of them will continue to be silent about the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins and isol@@ ate themselves from the white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to dis@@ soci@@ ate myself completely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana ossi@@ anism : claims that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they can be completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which constitute the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement affected by the black woman .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures , as in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I am recognized as part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment in which my life is neither ignored nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine reported in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled over the past seven years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NGO - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance , working to protect the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work on a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the focus of her work is on trac@@ ed , poorly paid sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with whose help supp@@ ressed congregations can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Cur@@ riculum . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # ref@@ us@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the persons affected .
a police inspec@@ tor told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her extra partner , who had become violent to her .
since the end of their relationship , some time has gone by and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena pointed out about abuse , the display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez also took advantage of nothing .
a few days later , the second woman drew her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
when women reimbur@@ se at all , they generally receive no support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women , who admit being victims of violence , are at all reported to the law enforcement authorities .

it is hard to find out how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studio , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are several statements and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the available numbers , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney General filed 9@@ 600 ads on domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads on domestic violence in the courts of peace . here again 86 % of the ads of women came .
in the ads 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Minister of Women Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; there are 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners every year .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the co @-@ ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to her estimates , every ten days a woman died in Paraguay because of violent acts by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that under@@ mines nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then gave up . this should be regre@@ t@@ table forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise :
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read it earlier , I always thought that it happened only to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they let themselves be deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about abuse by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told him how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he wonder@@ ed whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had dropped so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that the victims of abuse at least had a certain complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that her former partner ab@@ used her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ o te Cre@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the women &apos;s statements seriously .
in Victoria &apos;s case , everything began with a psych@@ ic abuse .
her prosper@@ ous partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began beating them .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they received no support .
she led a process against her former partner , who developed into an un@@ man@@ a@@ geable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the abuse of abuse is a road full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft law was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # advoc@@ ate ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ invasive ) are part of a campaign supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original bill of the law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ ale is to explain and pun@@ ish@@ able criminal off@@ ences as already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia is the case .
thus , the bill was changed in some points in order to also win members of the law that feared that the road to de@@ crimin@@ alize abor@@ tions , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay , will be punished with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had intended to pay most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs which the victims of violence currently have to bear , if they just submit an adver@@ t and want to receive secure accommodation to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , mal@@ treatment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here a re@@ thinking has to take place so that violence is no longer seen as something normal .
those who are silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ate themselves and contribute to the fact that the perpet@@ rators are punished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to report such a long ad until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate was passed . however , parts of the law had been changed , among other things a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence have called for reconciliation .
opinions about the changes are dis@@ cer@@ ni@@ ble .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law are regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman one year after a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned Zeitung Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Korean authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking Az@@ am@@ n newspaper because of its coverage of corruption in the Sultan .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , will continue to be in prison , where he will serve one year of imprisonment .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and brought to court , but later returned free .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after completing his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at .
since then , alongside his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has held the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Secretary of State , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is marked by the insist@@ ent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic intelligence , public fre@@ edoms , including freedom of the press , restric@@ ting human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
the authorities systematically reduce peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and hin@@ der citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in public authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and detention by three of its editors last year is a hard blow to freedom of the press in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper published since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on Cor@@ ruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of having pressur@@ ised judge of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in a case of inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the magazine Az@@ am@@ n on July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a member of the editorial committee , was invited by ISS to the special department and arrested on his arrival from the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS played the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely , after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and dis@@ semination of the newspaper was prohibited on any way , including online , from August 9 , 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place before the trial in Mas@@ k@@ at .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closure of the paper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , for dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a prohibition of publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 Korean ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) , and a one @-@ year ban on profession was imposed on both journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i a security deposit of 5000 Korean Ri@@ al was fixed ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the pron@@ ounc@@ ement of the sentence .
the App@@ eals Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after the death sentence of his six months sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to be in prison , where he served his one year sentence .
the App@@ eals Court also pointed out the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Ken@@ yan government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the Minister presented himself once more against the decision of the Court of App@@ eal to restore the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the paper are not the only cases in which the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated in Oman .
further injuries include closing the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and exercising pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to susp@@ end its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Korean authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that its journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ anes .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization supporting human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and adjacent states by promoting freedom of expression and association , and the right to gather , peac@@ efully , and protect them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with its consent
medical research in Africa is rarely or even mentioned in the media . it is a growing area addressed to one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent are missing .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , when the AIDS epide@@ mic had first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the S@@ á@@ mi health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ laim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Sam@@ bian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I am also star@@ ing at a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GM : what do you think is the most important science topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
that has to change , otherwise we will always remain a receiver instead of being makers ourselves .
the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported in a variety of ways .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I saw great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , beginning at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , space exploration , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of living as a scientist in Africa compared to western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often , it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has bred salad since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties such as Out@@ ra@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many kinds of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were pat@@ ted and that he could not use it further for breeding .
the patents remain not only for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
in recent years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cart@@ els . due to this trend , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton still breeds let@@ tu@@ ce , but it needs longer since his work gets more and more complicated by increasing restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like a b@@ oul@@ der in a river that I have to shrink . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand in court , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot; he continues as much as possible and tries to extract those features he wants .
however , he is very careful and tries not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the United States and all over the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red red@@ dish salad of the Out@@ ra@@ geous variety in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus permanently usable for plant bree@@ ders .
in the context of the initiative , briefly called O@@ ss@@ i , US bree@@ ders can obli@@ ge that others can use the seed bred by them freely .
this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; bree@@ ders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not to sow it immediately - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the emer@@ itus Professor at University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the opportunity to grow new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection .
according to him seed plays a role in greater co@@ hesi@@ on like biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , corn , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; says he and takes on the ever more frequent mer@@ gers in the global agriculture industry . &quot; whoever wants to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables should also know that the way this vegetable is grown is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seeds is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ple@@ dge to keep their seed freely available to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasingly abundant intellectual property rights to plant material , which is thus always restricted .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all cart@@ els features are protected as intellectual property , making it usable for plant bree@@ ders either not at all or only difficult to use .
for other plants , such estimates are not yet available , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are in an even larger style than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are grown in such a way that they have specifically desirable characteristics - from those by which their taste or color is improved to such , because of which they will thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bree@@ ders is decreasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much less predictable by climate change .
in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokesperson C@@ arly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to recognis@@ es that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions like the United States Ministry of Agriculture set up the company for the preservation of genetic diversity .
it contradic@@ ts , however , the view that intellectual property damages other bree@@ ders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by making more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees it differently : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to grow plants that are adapted to the changing environmental conditions , you would have already lost the fight .
but the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders neither have time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make farmers work easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it becomes impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all in all Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the features ourselves .
the plants form it themselves and as a bree@@ der we finally have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Caro@@ l Dep@@ p , plant bree@@ der in the US state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i member of the board , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; if you breed a variety , you also breed its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for their cultivation , need mass @-@ wise her@@ bi@@ cides that breed into its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly gent@@ ri@@ mental . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( those who move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) have patents , they manage to survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton looks for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton also believes that bree@@ ders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks as if I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
I always need new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is protected against competition for 20 years , which makes it easy in my opinion . &quot; world @-@ wide resonance
although the US seems to be a leader in Open Source , the concept is spreading rapidly all over the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , introduces a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed programme . to preserve the seed of traditional vegetable varieties , the centre co@@ operates with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German organization Agre@@ col works on an Open Source license which is ultimately a form@@ less and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s commitment to bree@@ ders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i obligation can not simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it is opposed to the current practice of the European Patent Office which permits patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patents for seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for open @-@ source seed systems explains that the organisation is currently building a worldwide alliance for open @-@ source seed systems , which should be the official starting signal for the scheduled next year .
a consortium of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - a network of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - published a report .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes to see more people soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role in this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people realize that there is more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest C@@ ens@@ orship objectives in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above .
the Voltaire Network published a statement on Facebook in which it sharply critici@@ zed Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as it is now . AN@@ Y@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted , in order to overcome the block@@ ade and not to give up . we ins@@ ist on fulfilling our task .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based network of Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era because of alleged &quot; support for terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of website locks to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
apart from AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to Egypt on the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada made use of his blog for the dis@@ semination of columns and articles that he writes for not accessible websites and media in Egypt .
now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider with whom Zi@@ adas blog is located , on the other hand , is more accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while reporting about the student protests and taking a video on how the police practiced physical violence against two students .
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government &apos;s block@@ ade and reflected what this means for him :
to block blo@@ gs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though the blo@@ gging of blo@@ gs might not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It was possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a siege , an arrest , attempted murder , sum@@ m@@ ons to the National Security Council , the locking of blo@@ gs , and any other website for which I was working .
2 ) They proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , al@@ beit only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post items to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship .
but now , after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave ones walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked up 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , such as Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the block@@ age of providers through the circum@@ vention of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the locking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such a practice suggests the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that could have access to Egyptian users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ oring decisions are being made behind closed doors , causing the Egyptian population to have no legal basis by which they can proceed to court against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go on cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

day after day , newspapers in all Brazil report with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer will be murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bed pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 troops to the army , Navy and Air Port to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio in 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even sum@@ mon@@ ed the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports about violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explained the motives for their decision like this :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every big city on the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything that happens in the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , explained that this decision is not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognize war at all .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 territories that are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the paper continues to write :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police who only shoot and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ ina Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it more difficult for the police to account for account@@ ability .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as has shown extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio , in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ pleasing negl@@ ect of public service .
remember : Rio de Janeiro State is larger than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the statistics of 2015 , Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie in the north and north @-@ east of the country according to statistics from 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities are located in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the mur@@ als in each state , Rio lays on No@@ .@@ 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
specially the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ ina stresses , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the federal state of Rio in 2003 , was also part of these security policy measures .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decline in violent deaths . for several years , however , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio matches the criteria defined by the Geneva Con@@ ventions for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also raises serious consequences for human beings .
this requires the state to use means and paths that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
it is now a week since the police cleared the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot of the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the start of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victories World@@ watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and surrounding area , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege .
the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre by the Assad regime was perpet@@ rated on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been under siege both outside Damascus , which resulted in local inhabitants being dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points .
due to the many years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not among the traditional foods planted in Syria and are only rarely part of the Syrian food . however , their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tly of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and wa@@ iters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , who has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed his relief that it is now more and more &quot; gaining popularity . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to acquire 125 families knowledge of planting fung@@ i , says Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of writing this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do by Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
on account of the fuel shortage , locally produced plastic fuel is used to supply generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds origin@@ ating from regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom @-@ yard in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have spread fung@@ i throughout eastern Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
spreading a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cart@@ on , etc ) for the production of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creation of new work@@ places for people with disabilities , who are bound to their home .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege become visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts of Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ra@@ mp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government called for a state shower last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire erup@@ tions that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June there was a similar tragedy in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European For@@ estry Surveillance System , which monitors the forest areas via satellite ima@@ gery , in 2017 alone , some 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can give you a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire only in 4 districts .
all Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a . ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017
some images shared by Twitter users :

numerous videos spread on the web and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the Saturday &apos;s protests was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al of the Bund der agr@@ arian of Portugal declared the paper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for anything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open streets surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria there would have been a similar tragedy like in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned .
a wide @-@ ranging proposal to the Wal@@ dem@@ on , which the government had brought in after severe fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed construction activity from case to case if the applicant had funds for self @-@ defence - that was an open backdoor so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val carries on in the same article from the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees of easily inflamm@@ able wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , spread to fires of this kind .
to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on the 15th and 16th of October , when inhabitants were seeking information or attempted to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : it used fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt &apos;s own civil protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the server didn &apos;t stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the site was more than half a million acc@@ esses .

the journey from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur

in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan started by the Tali@@ ban .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat together in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan , for the last time with his family at dinner .
even if his mother did not say that , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe never again .
in the morning , the boy should break up .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Tali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara were suddenly sen@@ sel@@ ess .
the Tali@@ ban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his little wage , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than he himself to earn his livel@@ ihood .
back then , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ k rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we worked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were no services and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we could not freeze at night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous passage on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and landed on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ k returned to Italy in 2002 .
some time , A@@ shar@@ k was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy twice a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high twin quot@@ as . however , it is also true that the conditions governing asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can be drawn for months after the asylum application has been registered .
until then , people who don &apos;t have money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it took A@@ shar@@ k too .
but his im@@ mortal life @-@ sav@@ age helped A@@ shar@@ k to get rid of these conditions soon .
after several years of construction work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ k put his whole savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including dres@@ s@@ making , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pa@@ dua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Cab@@ u@@ lo@@ gna in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome there are also Afgh@@ ans .
but A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s objectives are far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and the retail trade and aim to return to the country that he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ k also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of a successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end stands stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ k has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
N@@ eti@@ zen report : bill dra@@ fts out of Egypt allow ab@@ out@@ tion of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in jail .
he reported on the clearance of the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya camp in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys N@@ eti@@ zen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament checks a draft bill that allows users to use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a government authority .
users must register in order to be able to use social networks within six months of the submission of a legislative decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number .
those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment or the tri@@ g@@ gering of a penalty .
the law , which has been applied by sixty members of parliament , is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another MP submitted a legislative proposal in which harder pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the president or a high official would be introduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under Egyptian law , the President &apos;s insul@@ t as well as state institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the legislative proposal , such an act would be punished with imprisonment and fin@@ es , the legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photograph@@ ed Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators fighting against the military coup that led to the im@@ pe@@ achment of the elected President Mohamed Mor@@ si .
as more than 700 prot@@ esters who had been arrested at the same incident , Sha@@ w@@ kan waited four years in detention for a court appointment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison management failed to bring the accused to prison in the cour@@ t@@ room , according to human rights groups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sha@@ w@@ kan has threatened the death penalty due to the fact that many human rights groups agree , including possession of arms , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal tri@@ bunal in G@@ iz@@ a spoke to the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of pro @-@ mor@@ si session block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the punishment of the journalist Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous case , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activists listen to le@@ aked documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours listening to Sam@@ i Ben G@@ res@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was inter@@ ro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would assure business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption attributed official am@@ ne@@ sty provided that they return all un@@ law@@ fully preserved funds .
this document , published on April 21 , on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the President &apos;s plans to support the bill look like .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources , stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which safegu@@ ards journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness .
does China want to force users of social media to present their identification ?
according to the new regulations of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require approval before they write or share news in social media .
it is also stated in the rules that registration will be required with full real name .
analysts suspect that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks . it is unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to en@@ force these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; do we see ourselves in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
not in Russia !
in May , Russia &apos;s state cens@@ orship postpon@@ ed the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat tran@@ scri@@ bed to register with the provincial government as the &quot; organizer of the dis@@ semination of information . &quot;
this designation is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to be responsible for the removal of content and to force them on request for the removal of user data .
these web pages currently include websites such as V@@ kontakte and Od@@ no@@ gor@@ n@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service Mail@@ .@@ R@@ u and dozens of other services .
Turkish court decre@@ es Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as block@@ ade in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication ensured that the site had been blocked because it came to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information source that co@@ operates with groups to promote a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain can &apos;t stop sni@@ ff@@ ling
after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a deliber@@ ate consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and to install malware programs that dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services on the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
