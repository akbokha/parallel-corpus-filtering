<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous plot of an oil-magnate, who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free according to Method Man," "" "I was as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish love letter about its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never thinks behind the mountain, as you say so nicely.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, like a former colleague puts it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people have responded to his statements and voted in favour of him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections was the highest number a candidate nominated by the party ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the Journalism Programme, who receives people from all over the world, a deeply believer person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps Weltanschauung agreed not to agree with Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at play.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who struggles for life long the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still adapts to Kristi Kappes's commitment, which always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leaks, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump remarked his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out however that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The argument with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair to describe the Trump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To arrange the people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and suggests an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commentates on the cruel decision to raise a man looking down with contempt on those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (NB.): "like the white against all other ethnicities," pun out white in allusion to the white and whiplash, as the big Van Jones described, has killed exactly what America has done so splendidly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have, America means everyone welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this land chose as its president twice the son of a Kenyman whose story, as he himself says, would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge portion of the white American that promises and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this, I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of his election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd responded with a loud "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your Americas?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they answered." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if someone who is not like you, would have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is Trumps Land now, the news said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find any place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="66">From misery to the stars: these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca in common with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played in both places has not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with garbage</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a big garbage dump, only 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists, but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now the La banda de MÃºsica (musical banger) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and banker violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth so a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they get out of school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They come always smiling and with shiny eyes and play in the hustle you learn day by day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village that is located practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with remanufactured instruments made of local solid waste materials are produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the leadership of Favio ChÃ¡vez have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all of which were made of garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and musician of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in trash. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a piece made out of trash.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra playing instruments made of remanufactured material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of garbage every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fill harmonics follows the orchestra with its inspiring performance of rubbish-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played its music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that opposes wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the shared use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia's waters before it searched the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a lawbreaker of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles have quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused," "" "Benedict Kiilu recalls, a senior employee of the Kenyan Fisheries Authority. he is part of a team who discovered and persecuted the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia, because of the plundering of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are alongside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that had driven the prime minister from their waters back then.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries which are like-minded people and work together. they exchange information and stand at each other where illegal fishing is concerned," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to track down. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing in regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate disregard of existing legislation through which certain habitats and species are to be protected can damage the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once impeded by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the snail stamp, with the information circulating between individual countries, the actions nowadays occur in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, suspicious cycling routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship transports its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then, on the basis of this information, refuse to accept such ships in their ports. which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "there are considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm which supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated $20 million in lost revenue, which the eight members of the network HISH-i lose every year because of the illegal fisherman who invade East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa is one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region is attracting commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among other things, activities such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, phantasy name, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an uninterrupted control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say 'You cannot run my port'." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me." "" "and exactly this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">The closed front has so far been working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of suspected ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found fleeing ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international crime control authority, FISH-i can share and preserve information on illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspect ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, helps to detect the illegal ships that are willing to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "and this we try to cross," "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers technical support FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that links different levels of information. FISH-i is supposed to help to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NGO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform, together with Google and the Oceana marine protection organization, a platform that provides satellite data and is able to display the position of each tracking ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with neighbours to get a better picture of who's doing what - that's simply meaning," "" "he says." "" "here's a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project that allows a global system to prosecute ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only detecting criminals but also deterring them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that had been fished without a license and hardly expected to face consequences will now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i meanwhile have a 33% increase in fishing sales since fishing boats are buying more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to track down Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets where they were forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars are lost annually by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">Six countries have joined forces there in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are also combating illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i.. "safety is the goal of making even more of such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia signalled its first major triumph: in October, there was Greko 1, a ship which was on the road under false flag. and not only did the ship travel without a license and were used trawl nets that are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also invaded into forbidden waters, reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "by taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "Bergh says." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working in the entire world sea.

<seg id="153">The street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are in protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the impeachment of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of MarÃ­a Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the opposition's motion to a referendum, the Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into void while congregating on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the regulator of Venezuela) you can find pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - including in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andean regions of MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the central north of the County of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country is steadily deteriorating, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the impeachment of the current President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, but in the end the reluctance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, acting at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation and violence rate is among the highest in the whole world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% to the end of the year) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum held for many as the only way to give the country the chance to reconquer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance, Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica or short MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Unit), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces to support the majority of representatives of the opposition in 2015, and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government seat, was planned to continue on November 3.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is so far as Venezuela: tomorrow National Assembly, Friday country-wide civil strike and on 3 November all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter there are pictures that talk about disputes, as well as reports of oppression and abuse.</seg>
<seg id="177">Particularly large waves hit the news of police repression in the centrally located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the protesters withdrew into the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement in front of the police and armed proponents of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later, they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country some demonstrators tried to stop the police, including this woman in the Andean state of TÃ¡chira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in TÃ¡chira do not wear a skirts, because otherwise one could see something that many National Guards do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic already shows the extent of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an impeachment procedure - this was now proved in the eyes of many by the presence of innumerable people on the street.</seg>
<seg id="185">Mytek's Media Labs:</seg>

<seg id="189">Others regard these protests as another step in the struggle against a government that has taken a little against the devastating economic crisis from its point of view and prefers to refrain from taking critical voices:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">Marches are increasing in frequency and intensity.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adaptable version of an interview by Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 on DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentinean news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take part in the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">Now as an adult male, Quijano said in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Cordoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial ended on 24 August 2016, with crimes committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the secret of his family.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I thought it was alright.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child of 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not see that my father was a thief, a torturers and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto Quijano had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmerie. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in prison La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10 year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijjanos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of the atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">They all called him Kent.</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black-and-white photo and called me to identify my friend on it.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you have befriended one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Just give up that they will not kidnap you one day and I'll have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, the revolutionary People's Army - the Military Arm of the Argentinian Revolutionary Workers Party.</seg>
<seg id="223">So he forbade me to go back to the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me that I would become a magician.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be alright.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the base of the military base I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="231">On the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to get off. he led me to a barrack where cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - were simply everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">All of it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small packet wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to wear it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great lump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were placed and kept me with a guard post.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Over there the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I sped in and saw a couch where people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied there.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving licence, witnessed a particularly miserable translation in the last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">The Japanese word (korean theorbo), which means "older drivers" - was wrongly translated as "awful motorists."</seg>
<seg id="349">The incorrect translation was to be read on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself from September 1 to 20.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake appeared to the translator Julian Holmes, a resident Kyotos. he was also the one who drew attention to the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, a daily newspaper published in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that nobody has read the translation corrected.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult to elderly people and simply unacceptable in an international city such as Kyoto," "" "said Holmes." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The bad English translation was removed first. the term "terrible drivers" was later replaced by the appropriate, although grammatically not quite correct title "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The Kyoto prefecture was apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported on the apologies as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are sincerely sorry that older people felt offended by the insufficient correction (translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News made a little more detailed dealing with the phenomenon of "awful" elderly drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "awful" was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of elderly drivers who are involved in accidents across the country are quite a cause of concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 deaths were caused by seniors in 2005, which corresponds to a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors caused 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has risen in the same period.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as their mother tongue to translate into English. this may be due to a lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons, or the relatively low number of English native speakers learning Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees themselves, still make translations internally. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made for the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and enigmatic sentences which arise from machine translations show that this technique can't replace any human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English phrases in Japan, including the enigmatic prints that often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but by large corporations or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">Hopefully the city of Kyoto will use a more serious source for its translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the website "Navalcon Libertad" (Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters made recordings of the protests in Caracas organized by opposition groups that oppose the government of NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved the parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a Traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was cut and advised the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the internet.</seg>

<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are once again disabled.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offerings such as Vivoplay are popular among Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report on protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations as the Commission saw this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">I signed up with @ vivoplaynet without cable TV and informative national TV channels.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is astonishing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEZfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transfers its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which DNS servers respond correctly to certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If an Internet site is blocked by DNS, the server replies erroneous or refuses the request when calling such a web site.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ le capitol, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third blocked channel, the transmission was suspended on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who transferred the protests into Caracas, was detained.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also been informed that the government regulates Internet connections, making dental veneers more difficult to access multimedia reports on the current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="417">"" "the article is part of a series entitled" "" "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" "", "which is edited and republished by Global Voices in Latin America." ""</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation from the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house proudly said about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "she said." "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she became ten years old she began to work as a Criadita for the family. in Paraguay, the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school are called Crimean tas.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a big family with little money passes their underage son or her underage daughter to another, more richer family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that children do not have to pay for many days of housework, which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice referred to as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for several years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Crimean tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated by the Crimean delta is generally not silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, whose daughter is in the belief that she can complete her training, improve her position in society and "make something out of herself," is transferred to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who assimilates the girl and justifies the exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that wouldn't otherwise be educated and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is abused, his family will experience it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know of it.</seg>

<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n came to hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed traces of severe beatings. shortly thereafter she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military family TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small town with only 3.000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira attacked MarÃ­n as long as he suffered lethal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a cripson.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela blamed the practice of Criadazgo, rooted in the Paraguayan society for the girl's death.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered in protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be "no more Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"more cows are registered in Paraguay than children," said Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to infringe the rights of children without impunity.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a rapid investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for the murder of the girl who was her Crimean.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n could be pioneering - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes in court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The daily life of a Crimean</seg>
<seg id="455">The Crimean tas are exploited not only as labor power, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the calf in which her father worked, had to enroll in bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="460">Alvarenga worked in her employer's house between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that you still have time to learn.</seg>

<seg id="463">On Fridays, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>

<seg id="469">On some evenings the host Alvarenga forced him to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>

<seg id="474">But she was perfectly clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also at school Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing about which almost never is spoken are bullying and the harassons exposed to crippling when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a crimson.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anybody to my home. I had no friends in the school or in the neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the Kurdistan mountains in the north east of Iraq, the animal rights activist Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the NGO Nature are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopard.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of the Leopards, who roams through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxopolor). in total, they are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered because of wild, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they find always less booty.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular species of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and flourishing of the ecosystem also depends on a big predator." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard actually in the wild is small and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a big cat in the camera trap, Raza shoots out in sheer joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a biologist, Raza likes to show passionately a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies for wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="538">Six years after the tsunami: the state of affairs in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011, and still the region is occupied with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">Early March 2017 documented the progress achieved for North East Japan, Kahoku Shimpo, the progress achieved over the past six years in order to reconstruct the lives of those affected by the "threefold catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi prefecture was a real prefecture in Japan's northeast that had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring Fukushima and Iwate prefecture have been evacuated as the tsunami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, Fukushima prefecture has experienced a nuclear accident, which alone is why 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">From a local point of view, the Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the life of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics from the Japanese reconstruction authority as well as survey results of those affected.</seg>
<seg id="550">Housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (s) were completed in the Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi recorded the greatest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light by 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, six years after the catastrophe, the evacuation of the shelters' shelters (that is, Kazetsu juutaku) is to be relocated to final substitute-houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, almost 80 000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated ones from Fukushima were still living in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuated homes, which were lodged after the disaster in temporary shelters, were resettled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">The figure for Iwate is 34 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefecture</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, affected by misfortune, opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial rebuilding in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident caused extensive involvement in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of agricultural land, with only 66 percent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of the land of Fukushima destroyed by 5 400 hectares are located in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered largely, but again Fukushima is far removed.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 per cent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can exhibit only 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to determine the overall picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated ones.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction, the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents found that still not enough was done in matters of catastrophes.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper strengthens its attention also on the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the tremendous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also a witness of the worst, disastrous, atomic accidents that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Nearly 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture of 160 000 evacuation from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled into permanent substitutions.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In disaster areas, most of the evacuated ones are older than 50 years old. they are well known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are building projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people from other countries meet who speak a different language, the differences seem to be larger than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">However, after a while, one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we look at these global connections. in our Into the Deep podcast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week: last Friday, a police officer had killed him during a demonstration in Goiya with a strike on his head. millions of demonstrators nationally took part in a protest march against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the German University of GoiÃ¡s, suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on this Saturday and now put him in an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is regarded as critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local picture journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures, the police officer's face was also visible, who attacked with a baton. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police reported in the Brazilian state of GoiÃ¡s that Sampaio had been suspended from active service until the end of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mateus Ferreira in Goidania (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be seen on television for six months and the whole repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Deseuralizador," a press channel of media activists from Goiya, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz on the web in which one can see how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics shortly afterwards hasten to him.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from a different perspective, is also immersed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the Mateus family, who lives in another state, Internet users now have donated 10,000 Brazilian Reais (about 2,700 euros) to cover part of the costs of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Goiana while he is in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="613">GoiÃ¡s has experienced a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish was assassinated by his father, because he had been sabotaged by an occupied school with a gas leak. and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a policeman who struck him with a stick in his face.</seg>

<seg id="625">The Villages Forgotten from Entindustralization in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba concluded the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular congregation of Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the fall, the sugar cane industry remained quiet in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the framework of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who rises every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane mills in the east of the region, which after a long inactive period are in operation again because they were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls specifically to have heard that in MaÃ±alich the sugar cane mill would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad administration decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the municipality already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity. 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 published report "Agricultural prospects" by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar exports would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "that was the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro in his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the decommissioning of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people, received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "when Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats most is" "" "scam." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents agree: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they constituted a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">The first letters began to come before the first half of the year.</seg>
<seg id="661">These were officially recorded documents, which were distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All of them were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was reportedly and the letters came more and more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was in charge of the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane manufacturers still in operation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, is waiting for retirement in another plant, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved against his will at the shutdown of the factory, in whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 work years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important working degenerating set has been wiped out.</seg>

<seg id="689">First Nations youngsters use hip hop to express themselves and get their own culture</seg>
<seg id="690">A song of "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo taken with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities throughout Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do this via hip-hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree hip-hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop thus learns that the young participants explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self-acceptance," or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the youngsters are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the territory of the tribe of the Kithkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of Tears," a section in Western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to mediate how important the preservation of traditional customs and habits is despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages even though the youngsters do not always speak of the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation added, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received a little help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcript as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as a youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and also move forward with our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they have chosen the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the comment section, the reader and advocate of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also adds a contribution and adds the verse to Silenille (which is also published on his blog and republished here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is exactly on the menu are displayed near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru ("plastic models of dishes") of each dish served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">There are a large number of small companies in the Tatras district of Kappabashi that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend turns them into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matomas, the blogger has published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile tapes decorated with plastic trays as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have turned into kitsch collectibles, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo-Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food products is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) has been transformed into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we have found a good use as a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part of the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple attached to your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some cell phone stand and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or nitrous oxide is used, a popular topping served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anybody who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughing cheat?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasantly.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest cell phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further bizarre plastic dishes can be viewed at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the city of Kappabashi, dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry, for example with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="752">Behind every corpse, behind every bone find find in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico founded the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with drug trafficking"), which tells these victims a voice and tells stories of people involved in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>

<seg id="777">KYHB, a veteran of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the federal state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've known illness and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">Every day I pass by newspaper kiosks and see the title pages with images that can only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is reluctant or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent to this or consider this to be normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) when he is big. and it is not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The insomnia of people is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the enforced disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified by being "depressed."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they do not move and remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four-month blackmail in the main town district: how a family was plundered with threats from their business until the end not only destroyed the business, but also tore up their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>

<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when to kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I wondered if tears would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "the journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega has published the paper" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a Generation of Violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, fry potato, make tortillas warm and make "chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every age of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood had passed by two years before when he was just a few blocks away from his home, seeing the bloody corpses of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as a force mastered by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world based on the number of murders, according to the Government Council for Public Safety and the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor had 3103 deaths. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," animal PolÃ­tico founded the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015, whose goal is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the past four decades.</seg>

<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>

<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images on news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank truck traversed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people lost their lives.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected and devastated for years. the roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker fell victim to this.</seg>
<seg id="828">Officials described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses including a cinemas near that was full of people watching the soccer world championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses routed and charted corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to infinity.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "Das belongs Nigeria." from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident depict the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charcoal bodies lined up on the floor while persons are looking at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story doesn't end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photograph was written several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed real but not related tragedies, particularly occurrences in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eye witnesses drastically reported atrocities they had to flee from.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and stores were burnt down and bodies were buried in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one was left to count corpses," "" "said one inhabitant of Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up time could only be illustrated by satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unclear, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt by Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of false supplements; Africa Check has documented supplies to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a privilege for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments such as this example falsely falsify the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture taken from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly prosecution of Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning report, published by the United Nations, those who were able to escape punches, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts appeared like the following, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an acidic news page, which was falsely claimed in 2012, the President Myanmars Thein Sein, said that monks and politicians were involved in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they had used the picture from the DR Congo to share this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and Images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames that pass through these posts. the first frame focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used with regard to greater discussion of the silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the murders of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is important both. therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens if readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Does this mood of misinformation and misinformation suggest that actual atrocities are untrue and the real horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The distribution of violent images has already been widely debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowledging the tragedy. at times, these images are even demanded of the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent pictures are desensitizing readers and viewers and taking the ability to feel empathy (such as this study which investigates how violent media is acting to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologist is experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against fake news. they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something that can be used aside from context or completely abusive.</seg>
<seg id="940">Any investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons used according to CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (irreplaceable) tries to offer voice enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (such as the famous Portuguese Saudi) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish Sobota).</seg>
<seg id="947">But everyone stubbornly resist any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand precisely what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists handle Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find for example words from the Mwochlap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - get your parents in recognition of how you have been striving for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness that you feel after warming yourself in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defuse other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page would like to publish even more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these little languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the Treasure Languages, which are highly valued by untranslatable, are invited to upload their favorite songs here.</seg>

<seg id="970">The island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flooding and landslide disaster in this decade.</seg>
<seg id="971">Initiated by the monsoon, which is normally employed by the end of May, the rivers Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nillaa and Attanagalu Oya came across the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country.</seg>
<seg id="972">According to a statement by the Sri Lankan disaster of 28 May 2017, 126 people were killed and nearly 100 people are missing because of the floods and sludge winds.</seg>
<seg id="973">Over 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (May 26) and around 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places of residence.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rainfall occurred on Saturday (May 27), and the water levels in some areas slowly declined.</seg>
<seg id="975">The health and hygiene conditions of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster:</seg>
<seg id="977">Flooding in Tawalama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters. Twitter users such as Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka Tweet provide regular updates on the flood situation.</seg>

<seg id="980">Today the Neluwa bus arrived in high water, water level up to 6 meters. village of Moragoda near Galle also flooded due to the water pegels of the Morogoda Ela.</seg>
<seg id="981">The Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five are made for the transportation of emergency supplies for the inhabitants trapped in their flooded villages.</seg>
<seg id="982">Various organizations and startups have also agreed to help.</seg>
<seg id="983">Facebook pages such as Help Flood Victims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Disaster Relief - Information Desk- Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg id="984">If any search and rescue teams require drones for their operations, please call the number 0774844639.</seg>
<seg id="985">For those who want to donate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -</seg>
<seg id="986">Today we are in the area around Keleniya and Himingana.</seg>
<seg id="987">Please call the number 0777449729 or 0777843841 today if you need help in this area.</seg>
<seg id="988">The call-call-App PickMe (Sri Lanka) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Katastopenzentrum will be informed.</seg>
<seg id="989">Last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Roanu, PickMe has launched a "flood control" button that allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations. they were then sent to the Sri Lankan Red Cross for free.</seg>
<seg id="990">They also introduced a "SOS" key, which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by flooding and landslides.</seg>
<seg id="991">The combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka where multiple social media platforms are fully utilised bring residents in need of security and provide assistance.</seg>
<seg id="992">This has prevented the loss of further human lives, whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normalcy.</seg>

<seg id="1002">I have already managed this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">People with whom I work or people who have been familiar with me for years separate me - the Sahar they know - from the widespread concept of "Muslims" who have built themselves up in their imagination.</seg>
<seg id="1004">They entail me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We do not see all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with being a Muslim, in different ways. but somehow we are all put in the same one.</seg>

<seg id="1017">Islam, the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the western conception the religion of Rumis was erased, as well as from the most popular translations of its poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting makes a great deal of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another consists in the reductionist images of Muslims which have been colonializing Western books for centuries.</seg>

<seg id="1025">I worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen these powerful, flawed narratives dominate our newsfeeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This narrative overshadowed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries, while the US did not even choose their first female presidential candidate.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognize that when French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and Saudi, Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body that these are both sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has staffed our collective imagination in such a deep and flawed manner that Sikh men and children often become targets of anti-Muslim attacks and harassings.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories, which we tell and because of the way we tell them, Islamophobia is not only fear of Islam, religion, but fear of the other.</seg>
<seg id="1034">To the 1.7 billion belong</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry, we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>
<seg id="1037">We also create narrations which help us to understand the world.</seg>

<seg id="1135">Storytelling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of Treasure Language storytelling (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the insurmountable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the variety of languages of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already held events since 2015, the risk of small and not so small languages is not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening to it often connected with it," "" "purpose these events instead" "" "listening to appreciate, to make sense." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers will first present their story in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and their presentation will lead to the fact that the audience settles on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotion, as if the language no longer has a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, storyteller Rassiduou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamus tells the fables of the rabbit and the Baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his parable, John Nyamus is asked: "how is this to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a broad smile, he shares his sense of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytellers.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for reestablishment of sovereign debt from the USA</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the goal of a revision of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which took place at 72 million US dollars, several religious and bourgeois organizations took part in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017; the march started at the South African Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda."</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the re-establishing of the debt have also filed a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syriac-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue to campaign for freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, hosted in Berlin, dedicated an event to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, a publisher of books produced in France within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Post-Research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and is available free of charge, contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is an homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge, and what is the real cost associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartoum, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted from the directory of the Adra prison in which he was lodged on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information whatsoever about his current state or place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book titled "Collective Remembrance" gives his friends and his family a voice that is pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us are beginning to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of sometimes extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in charge of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military tribunal from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 who claimed themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His residence and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist, and at the moment the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels's cultural prototypes was more foresighted than the work he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilisations and here Greek-Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he started working, the IS would make everything possible to wipe out this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent all my life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">He taught me English, even when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he has taught other detainees to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other detainees how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a commission she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests against the Bashar al-Assad regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">By 2016, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17.723 Syrians have died in detention since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: Director of corruption due to corruption</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger to a seizure of corruption in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence, in which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and together with four other defendants was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the Mozambique airports, whose Council was Chief Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re-election to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic who rejected the request, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to relinquish his old post as the company did not perform any disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not welcome the action.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish its director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a regression regarding the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that even the company should have initiated disciplinary proceedings against the refuted.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparently remained silent and did not take appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case" "" "contradictory" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant, after being sentenced to a prison sentence and half of it.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid talks and motivating speeches, he could consult and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he agreed to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Refutable!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director has no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">"" "" "" "Cambaza is rewarded by the state because it insults him. I can't believe that you are rewarded in such a way that has already insulted the state so massive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is lacking morals and serving the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served themselves in the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself became weary of this man who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeuste prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel will not only be remembered as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, single-edged and - by the way - prophetic Redner.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was when he vigorously confirmed that "an ambitious man was able to sell, even the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest."</seg>

<seg id="1281">The reactions were also negative in Twitter:</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users wrongly</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or splits.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although it is still discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an "Indian" adjective.</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or of the local (in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word have been censored in order to express their use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with different meanings that have the same sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookeeper Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty fashion whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question mark (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet believes that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before deleting all posts that are suspected of racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on faceook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the adjacent words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (splits).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to anyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat proved that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or an alternative spelling of censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he just wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new policy by Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post from Facebook was removed and I was forbidden to read, post and share content for 24 hours because the post "didn't meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">To censor such words will bring even more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support, and thus banning words such as "chair" or "pea curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great turnover, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has ensured a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that didn't contain hate speech, but were removed anyway:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and eat a pea curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out if Facebook is removing the mail containing the word "Kalar."</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post states" "" "If you are a doctor, then heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, the role of hate speech in social networks is to heat up violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where clashes between Muslims and Buddhists forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticized for his failure to control the proliferating hate speech on his Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">Instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better, more likely to be looked at in context than initiatives focusing on code and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was published on January 18, 2012, in contrast to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based on Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series resist the blockade.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to using bypassing tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second best known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirror sites (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System) when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine calculator connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">However, the content is accessible despite legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogger, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we decided to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the contents in a decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has issued both tr.vikiansiklopedia, a Mirrorpage from Wikipedia, as well as WikiLeror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar Mirrors if prohibited in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and member of the mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One accesses a different URL that is not the original. that what one sees then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server redirects the request to the right Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with poorly positioned motives and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera with him and to try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal's animal world to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when I suddenly called me to Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti River a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to kindle pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Neptune's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he already stood face to face to tigers:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't disturb the opinion of the sheep when sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness on the way home when suddenly the King of the Buzhek appeared. he immediately starts to see us and he stares at me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">"" "to promote the protection of wild animals Sagar placed the logo" "" "I click for conservation" "" "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos." ""</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and lived mostly in a tent to take pictures of Otters at Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure, and fear of the consequences should they ignore the norm, keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state Odisha by a pseudo court and expelled from her family and the village community after having addressed a married couple with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives also by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer permits to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Wallet in Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, performed a unique club and became the main topic of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community of Video Volunteers and sets up for the dismantling of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paola has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices, such as child marriage and banishment of HIV- and AIDS-infected people, and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She tells us how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors for change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion was women who don't call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem that women could easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to mention the names of their husbands, is a custom which they all have dutifully maintained and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is regarded as deceitful, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">"" "" "" "tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion." ""</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home, as it is running.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in the baggage, Rohini started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini presented a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to get started the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked all," "" "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can tell us how they want it means that they do not respect us?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenaline rush of having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided they would actually try to call their husbands at home.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another member of the club decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>

<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation resulted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zinapberred dot on the forehead that indicates the spouses:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would carry the zinapian point if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely, but think they are now in a better position to choose to not wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the Discussion Club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip at every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what they hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last few months they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so sincerely about some things, such as our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to tell you certain things, no matter how small they are.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is associated with clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only taken saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them it's okay, but some wanted to wear a Salone-curta, a wide shirt over a pair of pants; they did not dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of controversy and discussion about the benefits of their own choice of clothes, the morals combined with the saris and much more, Rohini muggled her own couple of Kurtas (Oberinhibitors) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini are sure they'll manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are slowly rolling:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far, we have only made small steps up to now.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped telling the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some of them, including me, do it, but only when they are alone and not other members of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the Discussion Club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as sliding around more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult-to-navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from Malawi's border.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently confessed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is a local superstition that the head of a man of bald man could contain gold or bring wealth, said the police spokesman of ZambÃ©zia on BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of murder for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN Security Council carried out a mission in the South African country in order to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of Southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in the city of Maputo.</seg>
<seg id="1595">He warned those who plan to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Attention to Cahle men who travel to Mozambique by bald men in Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks, the Mozambican police warned according to the latest killings of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Husky Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police have already followed the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of ZambÃ©zia, has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans (PRM), which also indicates that a faith existed, according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate the riches.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">On Facebook Angela Ferreira Samantha shared the chronicle of the Bloggers poor Snaippa, indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulties faced by Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÃCHTE GERNE DE IN Mozambique, THE SME ashamed a country in which people would have shame to pursue good marks, and even take their lives to earn their bread, a country in which neither the Albinos nor bald or bald-headed for abhorred purposes or "black magic" would be hunted that aim to attain fast riches.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some of the opportunities for macabre humour could not be missed.</seg>
<seg id="1605">Zenaida Machado, scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique, tweetete that both the chief of the district of Morrumbala, Pedro Saphiroth, and the police spokesperson ZambÃ©zias, InÃ¡cio Dina, are both bald-headed:</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo caught attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized due to liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009 Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state endangerment) after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto demanding democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Liu case as an" "" "an internal matter" "" "and told a spokesman that he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this issue with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to appeal to the international community to release Nobel prize laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some foreign reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to permit a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg and foreign minister BÃ¸rge Brende refused to answer questions about Liz's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was dashed after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that ultimately it was nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were only resumed in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After spreading the news that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his award in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union: European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for China to release Libor, as she stated in an explanation on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Liu's wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all the visits they desire, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also to release his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The US Embassy's request drew a furious response from China, with the statement of the Foreign Ministry that "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told us that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and liberty, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his election, to which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also adopted a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters that China had major concerns whether the vortex of Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada and Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum China urged China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer told AFP earlier that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum says further:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada urges China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and freedom to exercise these rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's foreign ministry demanded China in an explanation on 29 June to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where he needs. furthermore, his wife and family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information whether France will eventually receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan and Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of Rural Affairs in Taiwan urged China to release Liu on 27 June and show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to call for political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progress Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama The Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader of Tibet, the Dalai Lama, expressed himself very concerned in an explanation on June 28 about Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for Liu's well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was strictly punished could have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem foolish, as Singapore is recognised at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticized Singapore's dominance of the only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He assures that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog" "" "Cavaliero" "" "accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious country, one hears that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of fleeing from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries' in the face of that, he inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally towns which are permanently guided by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core of the topic, the good old lyre plunges from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic because it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the responses given over the last week of shanmugam were given to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-responses.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He addressed relevant questions in a rational way with non-responses.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point if he was paid high to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out the criticisms that one should begin to read the entire story of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Please read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said Singapore was rather a "city" than a country, "he explained why the Singapore elections were so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore to cities in the USA (and how many of these cities witnessed a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said Singapore" "" "is no country," "" "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about shanmugam, which makes such a polemic statement as leader of a growing generation.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore had said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard who expected me - I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he really believes and is aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the vulnerabilities of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr. Shanmugam" "" "have a good faith" "" "or was it a joyous spokesman?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are viewed only as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, to which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is both land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, but don't they defend their town?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who needs to pay bills to our Prime Minister?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>

<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have angered many people of Singapore...</seg>

<seg id="1740">Their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series, with rumors exposed about certain parts of the world and a different facet is to be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">"" "the question asked me most in Japan is:" "" "are you Americans?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1743">"" "" "" "no, sorry," "" "I answer." "" "I come from Canada." "" "since 1994 I live in Japan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on what situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">The standard answer is usually follows: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians perhaps cook inside with anger when they are kept for Americans, but that doesn't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians get a Canadian flag clearly visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All dear Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The Americans, on the other hand,....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I started traveling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried small maple leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care system!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons at our disposal!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Same-sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">Everyone seems to think Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">"" "we obviously say" "" "sorry" "" "very often." ""</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is said to be the most tolerant country in respect of ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as these guys south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Firstly, I have many American friends whom I admire very much.</seg>
<seg id="1763">It wouldn't matter to me if someone would confuse me with Johnny from Dallas for example.</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First, to be called "nice" means to be spooky - like the benevolent, gentle yet tragically insignificant figure of Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (who has his own Canadian dual-DoppelgÃ¤nger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really is a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing to push.</seg>
<seg id="1771">To be harmless is to be unobtrusive and uninteresting and to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good, if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from the things that happen around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders call "nice" is perhaps just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence across the fence.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm, open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Thankfully for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau stepped onto the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice."</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band in Thailand published a music video that parogues the junta, which seized power in 2014, and despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">"" "the new song" "" "Dictator Girl" "" "(Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the prescriptions about his girlfriend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not politically, the music video still indirectly refers to the continuing military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">In the first three days alone, the video uploaded on Facebook was shared 1,254 times and received 8,800 likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, the Charlie Chaplin video "The Dictator" was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially how it behaves with the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these recordings of the video, which refers to some of the political topics that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of girls" "" "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional Constitution, which grants absolute decision-making on important national issues to the commander-in-chief of the army." ""</seg>
<seg id="1790">"" "the 11th rule:" "" "change your attitude" "" "refers to the notorious program for" "" "change of imagination" "" "by journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are considered critics by the Junta." ""</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army to monitor online content and to prosecute people who were accused of having slandered the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand employs a strict law against "read Majeste" (Majestic insult).</seg>
<seg id="1794">Martial law was proclaimed in Thailand on 20 May 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup d "Ã©tat of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money is unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before bringing them into internment camps, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are in prison, because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should offend the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile the teaser of the songs showed members of the band who imitated the Salut from "The Hunger Games," which was already used by Putsch opponents during the protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink bridge frame and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bear shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Afrika.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For approximately $2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs RamÃ­rez talks, people come into full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they begin shouting: "Mama Afrika!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you in Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy drugs that they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Afrika is an appropriate nickname for Ms. RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move northwards.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other companions of Mama Afrika." "" "Mama Afrika is a well known name on the track," "" "declares Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitians and Africans are often traveling together and that Africans are already talking about Ms. RamÃ­rez's Whatsapp.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his trip to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Ms. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Afrika is our mother and we will never let her go again," "" "he answers smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells her guests often send her text messages when they went away to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her labour.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chickens like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for migrants travelling through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city leads a dead end to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter Valenzuela and his family have included migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants travelling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled Honduras with his wife and his three children from people who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">He asked for an accommodation in Tapachula and an unknown person, a single person, offered him their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Afrika is all again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, travellers should consult their phones quietly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. RamÃ­rez appears to be happy that her house is full but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she browses in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care that she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly as she puts her in front of me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeats every time. "you have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang of Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a mobile notification in which they instruct the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message, it is said that the app should" "" "prevent access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities also called on the app to use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group shortly after they had installed the app.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police informed that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information," including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app for minors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those living in distant, repressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit disturbances and dissatisfaction in the areas of conflict, authorities often arrange extreme engravings and surveillance measures as well as routinely Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet, "Images from mainland China," published censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen asked the residents randomly to check whether they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You have forced the people to use devices intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the recovery technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (Pack Trust) also published a Jingwang product description from which the software can raise the password request of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unlimited access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council to minimise the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and institutions connected with the Party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office on the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current Freedom House report, a US human rights organisation, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, authorities issued a decree to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" at local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible offenses, including those referring to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2057">I enter the auditorium and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he is coming to me.</seg>
<seg id="2058">He starts a "pleasant" conversation, in spite of the expressions that derailed to him: "my boy, you are still young, you can start so much more important with your life than to join these Tagedivines and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end."</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I got used to it, not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I really can no longer say exactly when insults and punches have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how it happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished, although I had nothing done to deserve this punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Of punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to pull me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the knobs.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner delights in your cries.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot withhold your cries.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My screams didn't bother him enough, so they exchanged the pipe through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">At my first arrest, I wondered if the investigator used to work as a waste collector or if it belonged to the normal work equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had four cables intertwined to present us those, from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one hour, three of them alternated while I was still in the turn.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner noticed the cooling down and didn't take pleasure in it, which is why he moved next to an electrically charged bar.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity flowed my whole body, enough to supply my whole district.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My half-naked body lying stretched on the floor was the perfect conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours, he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">A few hours passed, which happened to me like minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call for the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"" "the door opens and the morning light fills the room." "" "Raus with you, Arschficker" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2086">"" "" "" "be quiet and go away, you will be laid." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he locks to his screen, sometimes to his computer, sometimes to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel accomplished its occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaib's family to escape from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as fellows (for example: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now Hdaib has been a passionate activist, opposing the conservative majority and questioning its well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking, and he can sympathise with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though he does not admit it openly, he overlooks the American foreign policy as a special aversion.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, has anything to do with his identity as a "Palestinian winged second generation" - so he describes himself, even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine before.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think so, because of my own circumstances," says Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a man," "" "while he pours in water soldered NescafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the consumption of food during the Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness in breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protests against Islam on a hot young day.</seg>
<seg id="2107">In principle, the slag of lukewarm coffee and the squadrons of the Kent-cigarette in the nose are primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan is like a prison under the open sky, especially when you look at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - just like drinking water in the public during Ramadan - in order not to land in jail.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front-singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert statement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was "just" cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also assert that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activism which inquestion the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila underestimated the Jordanian people as" "" "progressive supporters of human rights" "", "who continue to use" "" "for intellectual and cultural pluralism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement might not be just plain rhetoric, but actually reflects an ever-clear crystallising reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib retreated traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, the number of "murders" has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary murders in 2016 reached its zenith; however, it is still difficult to say that Jordan is lacking institutional infrastructure in order to support women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law to fight crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of inner-family violence can "be kept in prison indefinitely" and for their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee from the family that nothing will happen to the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known not to shy away from issues that have long been considered taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I was told politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the nucleus can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song one verse repeats quite often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one, in his words, "can get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals were strongly censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, in order to note later that his comments were torn from context, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed only a modified version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance towards homosexuals is not unrelated to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nueva, a poet of the eighth century, still today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nueva, who was later to work on behalf of the caliph, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service adopted several former government officials and members of the teacher association, with the reasoning that they had critically addressed the problems associated with the deep-rooted corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a permanent giving and taking. Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - that is Hdaib - consists of slow, deliberate and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to "experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be approached by a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions, and artificially induced democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue raging and consequently resists.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Uta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">Another theory states that the solid wagons, the drums and dancing have been handed down over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies marched from west Japan to the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emishi, into their knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two solid wagons are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18 meter high solid car was unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">External appearance and body care were rare as in this history, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for esthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens go into the seasoned hands of hairdressers, who can recreate these complex hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unparalleled demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts face each other in order to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (see more videos about current competitions on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions like the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, which is located in El Callao, found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressers and to receive training in the hairdresser's art instead of bad advice, which enables them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of youths have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year started in March, the school offered special educational workshops and reported on some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because out of love for the children we have built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "", "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel expelled?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely the question of the young Colombian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to write to the campaign Carta por la GuadalajaciÃ³n (letters on reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently was their country the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the treaty of peace was considered so significant that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, before the Colombians, there is still a long way to talk about true reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years, who were exposed to war rhetoric and carrying their weapons around the clock, must now re-integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society in turn, accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now take in its ranks and support it in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "" "" "Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would have to join together and help in the integration process." ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrillas to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak to Kailash Satyarthi, awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more urgently.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He was planning to share his love with people who needed the most urgent response this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The plan was to write letters full of hope and support for the former fighters of the FARC who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," she says.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo, travelled to the camp to deliver the letters in person.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members got up as they had done before to receive orders from their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," said the political scientist Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter brought me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down because beside him on the bed was a MGL-Pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "then I asked him," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he said," "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life has anyone wrote me such a beautiful thing, so I answer it." "" "then suddenly tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. joining the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there that waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to handle weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now that peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start, students and some of the FARC leaders came together to make a discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already in war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice made on the part of the State on all the Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help to shape society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "" "" "for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who have never heard heard and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and hated even people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who killed and caused so much harm, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">For example, Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter to DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians have been prophesied that peace would reign after disarming.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to resort to arms, to rise and protest for their rights. and that is also totally justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC are now betting on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and sacrifice because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. for those of us who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties will be imminent.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got everything and began screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which hospital wing were you laid - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are out of date, my male name is still on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I first read his name on his office, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for dealing with me respectfully.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked me absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by running up without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Grozny and say that I had not changed my gender, that everything was only bad news, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still difficult for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has humiliated not only your family, but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It became too much for my mother and she lay a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later stood under the window a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 mag.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time it became clear to me that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help, I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering, without knowing anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it in the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't believe, you're sure, just because you've left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know in which hotel you are in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about gender equality, this is a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I desire, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When chatting with camera, I really care how the person looks at which she recalls from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: last week I filed a report in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who had imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told us that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not exclude a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">In this way, I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced satisfaction with blood.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still being held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine told me that there were not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives in order to put themselves to Kadyrows's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can later be presented as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but purposefully immersed in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone imprisoned for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was himself when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not introduced as bandits, but there were no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already familiar with Grozny when I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was applied, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia wanted to bring us to the" "" "civilisation" "" "originally, but ultimately pushed us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had tinted lashes, bore tubes and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Health of Sharia has never even bent my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theater in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">There is a saying in the Chechen language: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't worry about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to have children funny when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes from you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began talking about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us per se, but mainly about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people in the city started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who smiled and laughed at first looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time, I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came home I was able to feel how the situation in the republic was steadily deteriorating.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you follow now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teetreins, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I do not tolerate cents for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I cleared the type of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">This is the nature which has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to tell you foam in front of your mouth that there are no boils in them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestanes have what the Cabardines have, the Russians have also; on the whole planet there are - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many think about transitions to men who love men and they believe that you change their sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be precise, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of suicide among the impoverished Arab Ahrazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian ancestor region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months there has been a strong rise in suicides.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man called Jassim Moramazi on August 27 recovered the desperate situation of the Arab Ahrazi community in Iran, characterized by poverty and unemployment, in the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al Thawra in the province of Ahraz in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahrazi's human rights groups working in Ahraz and want to remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could no longer do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahrazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahrazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shabin Bani Tamim - have imposed this month.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families and pursue a safe work because of the persecution by the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahrazi is suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahrazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to deny their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahraz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy is still developing only slowly, and the local population receives little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime is systematically denying the Ahrazi-Arabs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a large number of dams, which redirect water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are located.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravating the devastation caused by dryness in the region, and to destroy the local farming as well as the fish and palm industries.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Achizi people rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahrazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of secondary school and completed 45% of university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahrazi human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," led to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among young Ahravtsi.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process.</seg>
<seg id="2424">As officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahrazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside of their homeland.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahrazi and be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahrazi had to endure, human rights defenders beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world wakes up and takes notice of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website AfrofÃ©minas.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves intersectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should be all feminists in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men nowadays.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later, and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I come to speak on skin color, on racism, on black women's women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention the way we have been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, they all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to "lift their voices and" Kumbaya, my Lord "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about the fact that, in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalised form of racist-motivated violence, which we are exposed to black women in a twofold manner.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to the school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of having domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all people of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot join a movement as a black woman who refuses to take into account any injustices in her mind, which refer to the sex as well as to the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always and again rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a demented and marginalized being in a historical sense." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation in order to advance their egocentric program." ""</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of blending skin color and gender. some of them will continue to be silent about the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins and isolate themselves from the white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to dissociate myself completely from feminism and join the movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana ossianism: claims that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they can be completely safe and in which the cultural, mental, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which constitute the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement affected by the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures, as in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment in which my life is neither ignored nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by Curriculum. the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# refuseinefraubin), which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police inspector told Ada BÃ¡ez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her extra partner, who had become violent to her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, some time has gone by and the police said their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another wife Balbuena pointed out about abuse, the display of Ada BÃ¡ez also took advantage of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman drew her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">When women reimburse at all, they generally receive no support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women, who admit being victims of violence, are at all reported to the law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content1 strokes and statistics 2 Unseen abuse and a legal system that has nothing undernimmt3 Paraguays laws: good approach, faulty implementation Strikes and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to find out how many women are really abused, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudio, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are several statements and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available numbers, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Attorney General filed 9600 ads on domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads on domestic violence in the courts of peace. here again 86% of the ads of women came.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads 40% of women said they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the real extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Minister of Women Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "there are 9 women who do not do this.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then gave up. this should be regrettable forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and not with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read it earlier, I always thought that it happened only to women who are too subservient because they let themselves be deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told him how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he wondered whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had dropped so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that the victims of abuse at least had a certain complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that her former partner abused her.</seg>

<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the women's statements seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victoria's case, everything began with a psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her prosperous partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began beating them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's advertisements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, they received no support.</seg>

<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a draft law was discussed in the paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# advocate).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Noninvasive) are part of a campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original bill of the law stipulates that Female is to explain and punishable criminal offences as already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the bill was changed in some points in order to also win members of the law that feared that the road to decriminalize abortions, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay, will be punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had intended to pay most of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs which the victims of violence currently have to bear, if they just submit an advert and want to receive secure accommodation to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, maltreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethinking has to take place so that violence is no longer seen as something normal.</seg>

<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is marked by the insistent efforts of the security forces, in particular domestic intelligence, public freedoms, including freedom of the press, restricting human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with its consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely or even mentioned in the media. it is a growing area addressed to one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent are missing.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research on these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up its own research capacities in Africa. a greater role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDR).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, when the AIDS epidemic had first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the SÃ¡mi health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Sambian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I am also staring at a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think is the most important science topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">That has to change, otherwise we will always remain a receiver instead of being makers ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>

<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I saw great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, beginning at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, space exploration, health care (non-communicable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of living as a scientist in Africa compared to western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it's the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">"" "the system that magazines are only accessible against payment (the so-called" "" "Paywall" "" "), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research." ""</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has bred salad since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties such as Outrageous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by its own ingenuity and the question of how many kinds of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patted and that he could not use it further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents remain not only for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cartels. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breeds lettuce, but it needs longer since his work gets more and more complicated by increasing restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is like a boulder in a river that I have to shrink." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do that now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand in court, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the features are already patented. "he continues as much as possible and tries to extract those features he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and tries not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the United States and all over the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red reddish salad of the Outrageous variety in the "greenhouse" of the station.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, briefly called Ossi, US breeders can oblige that others can use the seed bred by them freely.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open Source" breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties, and not to sow it immediately - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus Professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seed and the opportunity to grow new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him seed plays a role in greater cohesion like biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," says he and takes on the ever more frequent mergers in the global agriculture industry. "whoever wants to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables should also know that the way this vegetable is grown is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seeds is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative pledge to keep their seed freely available to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasingly abundant intellectual property rights to plant material, which is thus always restricted.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all cartels features are protected as intellectual property, making it usable for plant breeders either not at all or only difficult to use.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates are not yet available, but experts such as Luby suggest that mass-grown plants such as wheat are in an even larger style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they have specifically desirable characteristics - from those by which their taste or color is improved to such, because of which they will thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much less predictable by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto recognises that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions like the United States Ministry of Agriculture set up the company for the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts, however, the view that intellectual property damages other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant varietal innovations promote innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "thus, such protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them by making more material and know-how available to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees it differently: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow plants that are adapted to the changing environmental conditions, you would have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">But the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and continue to remain: "independent plant breeders neither have time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want to make farmers work easier." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it becomes impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">All in all Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant characteristics: "we don't really create the features ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as a breeder we finally have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Depp, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi member of the board, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "if you breed a variety, you also breed its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for their cultivation, need mass-wise herbicides that breed into its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly gentrimental." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (those who move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) have patents, they manage to survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks as if I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I always need new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitors will sell my grades in a few years, "he says." with a patent it is protected against competition for 20 years, which makes it easy in my opinion. "world-wide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in Open Source, the concept is spreading rapidly all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, introduces a "open-source" seed programme. to preserve the seed of traditional vegetable varieties, the centre cooperates with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also supports them to come to" "" "Open Source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agrecol works on an Open Source license which is ultimately a formless and legally binding form of Ossi's commitment to breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from country to country, therefore the Ossi obligation can not simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. thus, it is opposed to the current practice of the European Patent Office which permits patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">"" "" "" "however, an explanation is not a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line." ""</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the "open source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patents for seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' programme for open-source seed systems explains that the organisation is currently building a worldwide alliance for open-source seed systems, which should be the official starting signal for the scheduled next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A consortium of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest Censorship objectives in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">The Voltaire Network published a statement on Facebook in which it sharply criticized Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">Even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as it is now. ANYI confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted, in order to overcome the blockade and not to give up. we insist on fulfilling our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of Huffington Post and the Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera because of alleged "support for terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of website locks to victims. @ anhri is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Apart from ANHRI, there is no access to Egypt on the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada made use of his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles that he writes for not accessible websites and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with whom Ziadas blog is located, on the other hand, is more accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while reporting about the student protests and taking a video on how the police practiced physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly revolve around politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the government's blockade and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">To block blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even though the blogging of blogs might not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It was possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a siege, an arrest, attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, the locking of blogs, and any other website for which I was working.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, albeit only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post items to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave ones walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked up 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), such as Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blockage of providers through the circumvention of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the locking of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice suggests the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that could have access to Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is additionally worsened by the fact that the censoring decisions are being made behind closed doors, causing the Egyptian population to have no legal basis by which they can proceed to court against these actions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go on censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day, newspapers in all Brazil report with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day a police officer will be murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "Thieves robbed pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 troops to the army, Navy and Air Port to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio in 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even summoned the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "" "in which she announced to set up a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports about violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explained the motives for their decision like this:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every big city on the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything that happens in the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the heading "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, explained that this decision is not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubric in a country that does not recognize war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 territories that are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the paper continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover the atrocities of the police who only shoot and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecina Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence as a "war." this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it more difficult for the police to account for accountability.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as has shown extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio, in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and self-pleasing neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Remember: Rio de Janeiro State is larger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "when we look at the murals in each state, Rio lays on No.16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">Specially the company Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as Cecina stresses, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">The founding of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the federal state of Rio in 2003, was also part of these security policy measures.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decline in violent deaths. for several years, however, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio matches the criteria defined by the Geneva Conventions for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also raises serious consequences for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use means and paths that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for "collateral damage" and "lost balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the Favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">It is now a week since the police cleared the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident made headlines: a salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the start of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Worldwatch, a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, are located in Damascus and surrounding area, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region of East Ghouta is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre by the Assad regime was perpetrated on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas have been under siege both outside Damascus, which resulted in local inhabitants being dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Due to the many years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms are not among the traditional foods planted in Syria and are only rarely part of the Syrian food. however, their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Directly of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we chose cultivation of fungi because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and waiters." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices, who has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed his relief that it is now more and more "gaining popularity."</seg>
<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to acquire 125 families knowledge of planting fungi, says Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of writing this article, they have reached more than 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 â¬, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo by Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">On account of the fuel shortage, locally produced plastic fuel is used to supply generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started" "" "production of fungal seeds originating from regions" "" "before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom-yard in a tub. when this succeeded, they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"" "now they have designed a" "" "educational farm for the region." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have spread fungi throughout eastern Ghouta for free.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila stated that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many districts of Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government called for a state shower last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire eruptions that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June there was a similar tragedy in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European Forestry Surveillance System, which monitors the forest areas via satellite imagery, in 2017 alone, some 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2890">Back then, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Ashark recalled in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"" "there were no services and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we could not freeze at night." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashark left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous passage on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and landed on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Ashark returned to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time, Ashark was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "" "" "it is true that Italy is a second chance for asylum seekers due to relatively high twin quotas. however, it is also true that the conditions governing asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can be drawn for months after the asylum application has been registered.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who don't have money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it took Ashark too.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his immortal life-savage helped Ashark to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of construction work in the construction industry, Ashark put his whole savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of Afghans have emerged, including dressmaking, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience where the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Cabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome there are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">But Ashara's objectives are far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and the retail trade and aim to return to the country that he had forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are opportunities," "" "says Ashark with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Ashark also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques." "" "thus they can sell their harvest surplus on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but at the end stands stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Ashark has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>
<seg id="2928">Netizen report: bill drafts out of Egypt allow abouttion of social networks Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, for more than 900 days in jail.</seg>
<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearance of the Raba'a el Adaweya camp in Cairo, protesting against the decomposition of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Share a picture of @ Ciluna27 on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament checks a draft bill that allows users to use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users must register in order to be able to use social networks within six months of the submission of a legislative decision on the authority's website, stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months "imprisonment or the triggering of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which has been applied by sixty members of parliament, is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, another MP submitted a legislative proposal in which harder penalties for the insult of the president or a high official would be introduced.</seg>
<seg id="2937">"" "" "" "under Egyptian law, the President's insult as well as state institutions is already punishable. however, under the legislative proposal, such an act would be punished with imprisonment and fines, the legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy." ""</seg>
<seg id="2938">Should the law be passed, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian policemen while demonstrating violence against demonstrators fighting against the military coup that led to the impeachment of the elected President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">As more than 700 protesters who had been arrested at the same incident, Shawkan waited four years in detention for a court appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2942">"" "" "" "recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison management failed to bring the accused to prison in the courtroom, according to human rights groups." ""</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan has threatened the death penalty due to the fact that many human rights groups agree, including possession of arms, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal tribunal in Giza spoke to the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their coverage of pro-morsi session blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the punishment of the journalist Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous case, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists listen to leaked documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours listening to Sami Ben Gresbia, who is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was interrogated by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would assure businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of the corruption attributed official amnesty provided that they return all unlawfully preserved funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">This document, published on April 21, on the website of Nawaat, sheds light on how the President's plans to support the bill look like.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia refused to mention his sources, stating Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which safeguards journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he joined the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force users of social media to present their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new regulations of the Information Bureau of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require approval before they write or share news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the rules that registration will be required with full real name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suspect that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks. it is unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">"" "do we see ourselves in" "" "WeChat" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, Russia's state censorship postponed the access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">According to Roskomnadzor, WeChat transcribed to register with the provincial government as the "organizer of the dissemination of information."</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to be responsible for the removal of content and to force them on request for the removal of user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These web pages currently include websites such as Vkontakte and Odnogornki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the image board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service Mail.Ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court decrees Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the Wikipedias blockade in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the data that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "the Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication ensured that the site had been blocked because it came to" "" "an information source that cooperates with groups to promote a political diffusion campaign against Turkey." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website. it is, among other things, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain can't stop sniffling</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week, the UK government is in the midst of a deliberate consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and to install malware programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and secret services on the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
