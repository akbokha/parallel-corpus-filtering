that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before anybody heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly , that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally listened to phones by Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA translated Iran literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for nearly 10 years the government has been investigating Ris@@ en and called upon him to name his alleged sources .
in this train , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and to spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish confidential information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they are giving up .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many cour@@ a@@ geous repor@@ ters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they had been indic@@ ted for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to ri@@ fts .
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , the repor@@ ters and sources can always hide less .
instead of fail and ris@@ king to make statements , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secretly ordered his telephone bills ,
just like its e @-@ mail dates , financial and banking information , its credit history , and even travel information with the list of its flights .
amid this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers in his appearance , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned any more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional ad@@ dict , because the government has more and more ways to spy out all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to b@@ ypass the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
this is true of the moment in which they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness state .
today there are communication software , which did not yet exist when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls .
such a technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source revision system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and has been developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation I work with .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot provide any more information secretly , and many of the information they request would not be available from the outset .
however , Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only suppliers such as Edward Snow@@ den have a way to off@@ end mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the care of soldiers and wants to report about over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker who raises alarm to the contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ ders who warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; enormous sums of money have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to explain this week . &#93; this week we were sent by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot;
we actually see emails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works .
this has already resulted in very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ boxes in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of $ 2 billion will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others who are nerv@@ ously waiting for the next release , and on the next un@@ disclosed documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agent or John Gr@@ is@@ ham &apos;s novel .
it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should that happen to us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
all over the world , media and leading politicians like secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and veil their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people are very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a mat@@ r@@ yo@@ ff soup .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these fragile structures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the USA .
presumably because there were so far no prominent Americans who were present in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but through the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands , or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , in some US states you need less information to provide less information to start a company than to get a library card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has allowed frau@@ d@@ sters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this is in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a covered investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
it really shocked us that everyone except a lawyer made proposals to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anybody . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as a single case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior harder .
this may sound very us@@ ef@@ ull as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing ever changed , as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few years , we have seen proposals for greater transparency concerning the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU has been collecting in central registers on a national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the USA lag@@ ging behind it .
representatives of both parties introduced a draft bill in both parliam@@ ents , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama le@@ aks , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake labels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end this kind of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , we can finally end the transparency which now enables this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after finishing my design studies I made an end @-@ to @-@ end selling .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me enthusias@@ tically how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I became tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what am I doing now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the Peace Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I hung up there ?
a stranger sleeping in my living room .
what if he &apos;s mad ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed on ti@@ p@@ toes to the door , and shut down my bedroom door .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he had bought from me today hangs in his class@@ rooms . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers to me were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a time jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can make it possible to transform fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment is converted into a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they thought it was great and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ets ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we were touring with them through the whole city . when we said good@@ bye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed at us .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things were rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ us czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept .
this is what we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting .
they can then invite wild people over the Internet to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited for the ro@@ cket to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
no one who is still very con@@ sol@@ ation would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you are contempl@@ ating the things that one can do well . we have been able to design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now through design we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of which degree of trust we were striving for .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I &apos;d like you to unlock your mobile phone .
share your locked mobile with your left sitting neighbour .
this quiet touch of panic you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
so most guests feel like they stay somewhere else .
for this reason , our company can exist .
just so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es cell phone ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidates for the office of the president ?
you can now return the cell phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to share with you some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first introduced himself with his name ; if he told you where he came from , like his dog or his children ?
imagine you would have 150 jud@@ gements , all of which say : &quot; he can really hold very well @-@ un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your cell phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely .
in the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give off negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both the hosts and the guest handed over their testim@@ onial before ordering them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are in terms of age and residence .
we trust the people most that are the most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
it is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by assessments .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation stems from common ground .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted pre@@ dil@@ ections .
we also learned that confidence is dependent on how much money is offered .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your apartment ! I make holiday with my family holiday &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can design be created to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to take off those prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need that had not been met before .
for us the business runs very well .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who impro@@ per@@ ly celebrated parties or devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken .
there &apos;s nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve .
fortunately , only a fraction of 123 million overnight stays had a problem .
for people trust each other rightly .
if trust works , something wonderful can arise .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks based on se@@ d@@ entary activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save life even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring you books .
they leave one even longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay exp@@ ires .
but these relationships behind the pure cash transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing work together with monetary transactions ?
this is an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to call it just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing won &apos;t do justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relations .
people put a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travelling were a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if at any place you visit , a group of residents would wait to fill up a thoroughly and show one in a pub @-@ pent@@ ine neighborhood of which one has never heard ;
or if you could learn how to cook a five @-@ star chef ?
today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would create apartments from the ground up to toge@@ ther@@ ness ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would take the thought of sharing a common part ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul , this project has already begun .
have now been offered residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were transmitted to people whose children were pulled out . incu@@ b@@ ator programs were started ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries alone will be hosted by a stranger or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality also existed before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why has ours just worked ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this start@@ ling ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for Design in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply delay the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
this is how the media represent people who look like me .
one study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : Americans think most of them would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mo@@ m , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a car@@ rot @-@ fitness fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born that way .
I have decided to do that .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ten myself .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear my head cover for the hi@@ j@@ ab .
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence for me , compared to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only adopted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Koran .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
sometimes the beauty of rhythm brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understands you , and yet loves you somehow ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking News . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flow@@ ed into buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock quickly turned into indignation .
why should one do such a thing ?
I switched to the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into susp@@ ects from a citizen .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I drove me -- when we drove sil@@ ently -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time feared to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved to our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be alert , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do not be sam@@ pled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in the whole week in@@ doors .
then it was Friday this week -- the day when Muslims gathered to prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings were : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard from attacks on Muslims or people that were considered Muslims , dra@@ gging and beating outside .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumor in the U.S. body but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make America safer ?
maybe there will be some parking lots , but not stopping the terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant view of people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater citizen participation .
and as a director of the police in the Washington area , DC recently said : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
in the radic@@ alization process , it has been found that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extrem@@ ist group believes that terrorists are true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ it@@ or or denied by faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a man , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u Klu@@ x clan with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when one takes a look at them , it does not force what they read in their &quot; Sacred Scripture . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into scrip@@ ture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she wanted to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every minister with whom she spoke brought her silence , and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
nothing inspired and something that would have made sense to her anger was her main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution .
this Ima@@ m re @-@ establishes the connection to God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using them of their anger , he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect each other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian system of government , conformity and prejudi@@ ce .
one study shows : if people submit messages in which neg@@ atively about Muslims have been reported , they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumcision of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at when the mood against Muslims shot at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when assign@@ ing collective debt , it is not just about having to explain itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was at the Faculty of Medicine , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est and most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did such an accomplished young man come from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after Su@@ z@@ anne &apos;s visit to her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon .
he spent eight time at De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we opted for the mos@@ que .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took it out , pulled out my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the congregation were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come , not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had taken courage and compassion pan@@ i@@ ries and prejudi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who perhaps claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with a drau@@ ght , working in a noble think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fo@@ ol@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as allowed .
when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
if people like an exception appear to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billi@@ ard shop .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutes worldwide .
before air pack@@ et delivery penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft at Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre high tower of 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting each other , air@@ planes reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of spaces .
you can also build resili@@ ent structures on your own .
they have learned to bear burdens , deal with turbul@@ ence and in general react to laws of nature .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of possible in an autonomous flight .
in order for a system to function autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know coll@@ ectively where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ shoot of our labs .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the space , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called stern starter ,
a flight device trying to hit two flies with one flap .
like other star cur@@ sors , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters it can float , and therefore has great advantages in start and landing , and is very versatile .
however there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the flight device does not matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter .
such a question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled flight machines , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with just one worked .
this is the mono @-@ internal , the most mechanically simple remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently .
it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanically simple , inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room .
however , it does not have the elegant h@@ edge algorithm of the stern star@@ ters . to make it fly , I have to throw it right .
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of throwing it right , if all watch me is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the bu@@ n is an exercise in cont@@ ent@@ ment , this machine is here , the bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is very symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
in this way , it receives the external ability ,
move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course he is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some things can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at it .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely secure and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two prop@@ eller flying machines .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller comes out , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly if restricted .
we will now demonstrate this by making a half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration examines synthetic flocks .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took standard micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine over there would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for types like us the wage is in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , in a very distant gal@@ axy , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed faster and faster , transforming the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy .
for this short moment they ligh@@ tened more brigh@@ tly than all the stars along in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gravit@@ ational waves .
let us classi@@ fy events in the first place .
1.3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth .
since then , the earth has produced quite a few things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands by us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago a group especially cour@@ a@@ geous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravit@@ ational waves , which are caused by colli@@ ding black holes .
most thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy genius , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ ometer @-@ gravit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory .
in the following years , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved the detection performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to solve some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the detector was commissioned , the gravit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes ruled through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the f@@ arewell from my to@@ ying father .
in essence , they were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gravit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and their signals with observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals for 23 years . what are gravit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gravit@@ ational wave is a ri@@ pp@@ le in the structure of space and time .
while passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and the other is st@@ owed .
tut@@ ors in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity often lead to a really sil@@ ly dance .
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gravit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and spra@@ yed at hitting the waves . the stretching of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is called 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . that &apos;s why one explained the Lig@@ o associates for nuts .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite practical , because you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light around you from several points .
this is different with sounds .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
your child &apos;s face , for example .
instead we listen to certain characteristics like pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Alice is speaking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob is breaking them off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple images of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies lie in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
to listen to the gravity , can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very fast , you hear the same chir@@ p with an additional key change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement of movement , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14th , 2015 -- a date at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render sound &#93; Any@@ one who knows what to listen to , recognizes this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 times solar mass , which rotate approximately as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let us consider briefly what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling a hundred times per second before colli@@ ding .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
this is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe , as it has never been possible before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practical or basically -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we learned a lot about them all .
but the exciting physical processes happen in the nucle@@ us hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through because these are op@@ a@@ que .
the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big B@@ ang is hidden by his own illumin@@ ating light .
with the aid of gravit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back at the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that there are things that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt , which we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that cause black holes , like li@@ g@@ ament watching them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are the dust bones for our archaeological work so to speak .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different view of the events of the universe , the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as cour@@ a@@ geous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cus of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us ?
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to everything I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of was getting rid of my fear .
my fear to hold speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes , which changed my life deeply , to an unexpected kind . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treasures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pussy , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked her once if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the Beg@@ inning
from then on , I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; say to playing with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am the author . I think things out , awaken you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ am television . I produce TV .
I make television , in a grand style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for putting out 70 hours of program in the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days at four shows , therefore every nine days 20 million dollar television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes simultaneous in production , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series are running succ@@ essively on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are programs that I have created myself and not only produced , so still overhead . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fires and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who is still doing that ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you now run a company , a country or a class@@ rooms , a business or a household , take me seriously , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that I am not dre@@ aming about a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m deep@@ ened into the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas .
as if you had a high tone , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a bu@@ zz@@ ing begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could go for ever on it .
many people accept when I declare them the h@@ um that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , you do it .
but the bu@@ zz@@ ing -- when I started to work and work , build , create and collaborate , I discovered that thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . the bu@@ zz@@ ing !
the sum is more than writing .
bu@@ zz@@ ing is action and activity . the bu@@ zz@@ ing is a drug .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is the voice of God in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you can &apos;t look different to size .
the feeling of not being different than striving for size doesn &apos;t matter what price .
this is what you call the tot@@ als .
or maybe it means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it &apos;s called genius .
perhaps it &apos;s ego .
maybe it &apos;s the fear of a failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know I &apos;m not made for failure , and I just know that I love bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make it clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I must work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I like this h@@ um . I love the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I need the h@@ um . I am the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
am I just this hum@@ ming ?
and then the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
revised , over@@ stressed , over@@ stated , burnt out .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mom@@ my is a single working title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mo@@ m will not be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pussy , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the bu@@ zz@@ ing ceased .
the engine bu@@ zz@@ led .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was off .
the sums did not come back .
my money was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no regret , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect titanium .
I was a flagship Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no more fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fa@@ des ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ ste you , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you work , you love what you do , being a teacher , a painter , to be a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , one loves another , and that &apos;s how the hum@@ ming feels when you know the h@@ um when the hum@@ ming stops , who is you ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart list@@ ens , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no when two things become aware of me :
first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she did not call me &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
she calls no one more &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I am Titan and my bu@@ zz smo@@ kes , and here everything changes before my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and my panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of money , I can &apos;t do anything but watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl gets in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door enters and an energy boost enters .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing slowly comes back .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz , but a bu@@ zz@@ word .
and now I feel like I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the h@@ um , the titanium h@@ um , this is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself using broad@@ casts and TV hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real hum@@ ming depends on love .
the bu@@ zz is the current that comes from the lust for life .
the real hum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real h@@ um ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do it as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the hum@@ ming again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not enough to me as they work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work , because I love it .
I am better at work than at home .
this admission is painful , because what kind of person is working better than being at home ?
well , yes , I .
to be honest , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed , none of it .
we race around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst the bubbles .
in doing so , I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused .
I always go to my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I wonder : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can do it too ! always say yes , if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you think me nai@@ vely , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it &apos;s just 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something different .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie replaces me .
and when my teen @-@ daughter talks to me for 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year .
it &apos;s just 15 minutes , more does not need it .
everyone can spend 15 minutes a day , even on a bad day !
15 minutes of the play !
no mobile phone , no clothes , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to go .
but 15 minutes are included !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the bu@@ zz of having a place for peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and preserve it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I win . meeting friends , reading books , enjoying the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in education when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the piece , why not allow yourself 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the h@@ um came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my sum .
the Sum@@ ming of Life .
the Sum@@ ming of Love .
the bu@@ zz of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that .
it is snow@@ y to me that I am a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan that is going to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and to play more .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the tot@@ als . the land I create , the marathon , I run , the troops , the screens , the high sound , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the other , the right h@@ um : the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , lasting , naked and new feeling of life is spreading in me . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel that hum@@ ming , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , I &apos;ll stir you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and to play more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , in contrast to other body organs , has a very low self @-@ healing ability .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures .
they certainly have one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one im@@ planted an electrode deep in the brain to influence the neur@@ ons &apos; circu@@ it@@ ry so that the neuro@@ logical function improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was senior physician and worked day and night in emergency room .
I often provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
you have to imagine that cran@@ ium @-@ brain trauma will s@@ well the brain and increase cran@@ ial pressure .
to save life , it is necessary to reduce cran@@ ial pressure .
for this you sometimes need to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to use Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyze brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children , which are taken out of your families .
you have to find the proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and the surroundings in order to be able to flour@@ ish .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they slowly spread and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cellular population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they keep us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so sure .
one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them colour@@ fully in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we reim@@ ported them at the outlet point of the same individual .
we call aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- automatic transplantation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we reim@@ port these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we reim@@ port the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we re @-@ imported the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury to and reim@@ ported exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were reim@@ ported .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture .
of course we couldn &apos;t stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take pellets from a tray .
they did it very well .
when they reached a stable skill level , we passed the motor skills range in the mot@@ oric cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen in humans , they recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , as is the case with the ape .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you can see the monkey who spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before the injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
see now that we reim@@ ported the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implantation .
I can tell you that this was also very exciting for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze and use it later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ itate it in humans .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , and so on .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first of all , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients who perform treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
first , it is necessary to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for your visit with TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them self @-@ evident .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them un@@ changeable .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics is completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally made clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- did not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my ad@@ es@@ sion@@ ate friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save democracy but that we need a true and defensive democracy .
without democracy , our societies will become bri@@ ghter , our future glo@@ omy , and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the topic of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which is currently threatening our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin peaks parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognise the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the high net worth savers and corporations , which , however , are too sc@@ ary to invest where it would be productive and income that could produce all the things that humanity desper@@ ately needs , such as green energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , in the USA , in England and the euro@@ zone , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars were invested in all prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , rail , equipment and so on and so forth .
$ 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion sounds after a lot of money until one compar@@ es it with the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars that at the same time were lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except to infl@@ ate stock markets and hu@@ stle the real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not equ@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the U.S. , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand , which , as in a continuous loop , encourages the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which might be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up ,
un@@ intentionally the circumstances will cause him to kill him .
this is my Ha@@ des with Cap@@ ital@@ ism --
his very wast@@ eful art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and , in particular , to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the value of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on the basis of these exclu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they granted them the right to political participation with the same mood in question of state concerns .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian Democracy has not been held for a long time --
like a candle that g@@ lows very brigh@@ tly , it is quickly burnt out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not their roots in ancient Athens , &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a statute for rulers .
the liberal democracy first came up as a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two is taking place , while the economy gradually under@@ goes politics and distor@@ ts it .
wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not up to a degeneration of its DNA .
it is because it can be in the government these days , and yet not in power , because the power is diver@@ ted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my Ha@@ des with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that sustain@@ ably decim@@ ated the animals from which it feeds , that it is star@@ ved at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has har@@ med the policy so far that it har@@ ms itself by the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods are depreci@@ ated , the overall economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest in the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind .
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea by the way .
the Marxist left already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only gain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economics and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks become higher , the waste becomes more subli@@ me , and the social conflicts are deeper , as it is -- very soon as I think -- in countries like China .
we have to re@@ organise the economy and re@@ unite the spheres of business and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified field , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear as a documentary .
the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that he has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines serve humans and human beings stick their energy into the research of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long discussions the meaning of life .
I think we can be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be , how could it look to have this Star Tre@@ k @-@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in the practical implementation I would like to give you some examples .
in the area of the company : please introduce yourself to a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which you are currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all income comes from capital and revenue , and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction is made between those who belong to the company , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there , who do not belong to the company . no more exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and saving , and ultimately no twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please briefly imagine that our national currencies have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate in a universal , global , digital currency that is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that all world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it the cosmos , in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world in which investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we have them , especially against the backdrop of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world I describe to you is at the same time liberal , in which it fav@@ ors privileged people , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash bin of history , and Key@@ n@@ esian , global Key@@ n@@ esian .
but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
will we awaken in such a world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it more democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economics is ... Do we not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which means Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant .
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a liberal Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I &apos;m also totally s@@ wir@@ ling .
BG : actually , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not mad , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : it &apos;s a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers said you very clearly what you think from the West &apos;s point of view in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most is happening -- the sphere of economy -- is a fully democratic zone .
in some ways , if I can say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what we can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now pre@@ ten@@ ding to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century sm@@ ells enormously after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Greece &apos;s finance ministers at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sen@@ sed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing as we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
that is to say good @-@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the continual den@@ ial that a massive fault line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues to dras@@ tically thre@@ aten the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which by the way , was the first proposal to reveal this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , have chosen the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the changes occur , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you anticipate ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister who , after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the motion for renewal of the debt recovery program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they just wanted to overthrow our government , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that were running through the Eurozone .
they did not want to admit that they had been implementing a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s Troika , who imposed this policy on us , admitted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive sound of the talks , you seem to be still pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
for if they do not survive , the liber@@ ated centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to adopt the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for having been with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy Price has never heard most of them , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19th 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision Roy had met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fris@@ er and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for picking the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t choose any one .
he must find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve .
this curve is the valuation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows this rating is received .
if your show is judged by nine and above , it will be a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ted to where after you have st@@ owed a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as -- -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at that end of the curve .
Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to enter@@ tain &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the middle pay@@ load , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t enth@@ use .
so he has to make sure he &apos;s really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon is doing something like that , so Roy price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can watch everyone free of charge .
and if Amazon fi@@ dd@@ les out for nothing , it &apos;s up to you , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team that record everything .
you record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you jump over or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process it , and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com about four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha is landing at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked on .
approximately at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top @-@ show by data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of organizing a contest , he and his team have looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , the reviews they give to the shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9.1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course the question is : what is happening here ?
one has two very competitive , data sealed companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you optimize it through very powerful computers .
the least one can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is a little frigh@@ tening because we live in a time when we reach more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know the Multi @-@ Health system here ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room . come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the United States and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al occurs or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad will be decided if a person will be good or bad .
medi@@ oc@@ re TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always producing the best results . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
also the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the worst kind , could predict -- through data analysis of Google searches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked fine , year by year , until it suddenly stopped working ,
and no one could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was another sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data rapidly flows into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the enforcement of law , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy
over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be dis@@ semin@@ ated .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly need two things :
first , put this problem into its components so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , you put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re @-@ assemble the parts and then come to a resolution .
there is another tool and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to be put together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and reason where they belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , which they would otherwise not have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all these parts back together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; does not stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they were competing for TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order to not forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a j@@ a- or no @-@ question , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly prob@@ able &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will then dig it out with a technical demonstration later .
so far I have made a few decisions in my life , with which I should have heard in hin@@ d@@ sight on the ball .
but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with something much smar@@ ter , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
in the end , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I feel this is very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what you are doing and taking risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
