<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anybody heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly, that the NSA illegally listened to phones by Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this, he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA translated Iran literally drafts for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years the government has been investigating Risen and called upon him to name his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblowers and to spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish confidential information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they are giving up.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they had been indicted for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to rifts.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, the reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of fail and risking to make statements, this could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, have secretly ordered his telephone bills,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its e-mail dates, financial and banking information, its credit history, and even travel information with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">Amid this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's supposed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers in his appearance, but instead, the judiciary has condemned any more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional addict, because the government has more and more ways to spy out all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government's technology allows to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is true of the moment in which they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness state.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software, which did not yet exist when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source revision system for whistleblower, originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and has been developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation I work with.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news site just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot provide any more information secretly, and many of the information they request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that endanger all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is important to us to ensure that not only suppliers such as Edward Snowden have a way to offend misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers," ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Who knows about grievances in the care of soldiers and wants to report about overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker who raises alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street insiders who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>

<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[the "Panama Papers" revealed that rich and powerful] [enormous sums of money have hidden in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to explain this week.] this week we were sent by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see emails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already resulted in very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letterboxes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of $2 billion will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others who are nervously waiting for the next release, and on the next undisclosed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent or John Grisham's novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not all pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">All over the world, media and leading politicians like secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and veil their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people are very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a matryoff soup.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these fragile structures.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there were so far no prominent Americans who were present in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle behind which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands, or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states you need less information to provide less information to start a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">"" "" "" "this kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children." ""</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed fraudsters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this is in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked us that everyone except a lawyer made proposals to our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anybody. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as a single case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politician involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior harder.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very usefull as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing ever changed, as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "in the past few years, we have seen proposals for greater transparency concerning the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been collecting in central registers on a national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA lagging behind it.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties introduced a draft bill in both parliaments, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama leaks, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, are used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"" "" "" "we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake labels." ""</seg>

<seg id="96">This is the story I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after finishing my design studies I made an end-to-end selling.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip across the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me enthusiastically how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I became tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Ah, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought: "Oh man! what have I hung up there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's mad? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed on tiptoes to the door, and shut down my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he had bought from me today hangs in his classrooms. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers to me were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">When I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a time jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate pulls out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can make it possible to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment is converted into a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They thought it was great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham-omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We were touring with them through the whole city. when we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared at us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things were rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Bleus czyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">This is what we presented to investors: "we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">They can then invite wild people over the Internet to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "that will be the next big thing!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still very consolation would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you are contemplating the things that one can do well. we have been able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now through design we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of which degree of trust we were striving for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Share your locked mobile with your left sitting neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet touch of panic you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So most guests feel like they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">For this reason, our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gores cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidates for the office of the president?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to share with you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first introduced himself with his name; if he told you where he came from, like his dog or his children?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 judgements, all of which say: "he can really hold very well-unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give off negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both the hosts and the guest handed over their testimonial before ordering them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are in terms of age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">We trust the people most that are the most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">It is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting to add a person's call -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stems from common ground.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted predilections.</seg>
<seg id="186">We also learned that confidence is dependent on how much money is offered.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "you tell too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is not accepted. "" "</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "" "Tolle works of art in your apartment! I make holiday with my family holiday" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can design be created to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than willing to take off those prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that had not been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who improperly celebrated parties or devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There's nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of 123 million overnight stays had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, something wonderful can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks based on sedentary activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save life even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring you books.</seg>
<seg id="220">They leave one even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay expires.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure cash transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing work together with monetary transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">This is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but to call it just" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing won't do justice." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relations.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, it is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling were a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you visit, a group of residents would wait to fill up a thoroughly and show one in a pub-pentine neighborhood of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn how to cook a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Today, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would create apartments from the ground up to togetherness?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would take the thought of sharing a common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital, Seoul, this project has already begun.</seg>
<seg id="240">Have now been offered residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were transmitted to people whose children were pulled out. incubator programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the share economy, 785 000 people in 191 countries alone will be hosted by a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality also existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has ours just worked?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this startling,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for Design in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply delay the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">This is how the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans think most of them would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mom, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A carrot-fitness fanatikerin,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I wasn't born that way.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do that.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I decided to outen myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to wear my head cover for the hijab.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence for me, compared to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only adopted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Koran.</seg>

<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word "breaking News."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes flowed into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the television channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..."... in the name of Islam... "... in the name of Islam..."... "Jihad..."... "bombed Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It has not only been attacked by my country, but in the Nu the deeds of others turned me into suspects from a citizen.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I drove me -- when we drove silently -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was the first time feared to be recognized as Muslims.</seg>

<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>

<seg id="320">"" "nowadays we can actually hear people say:" "" "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims." ""</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumor in the U.S. body but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">Maybe there will be some parking lots, but not stopping the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant view of people of other faiths, and to show greater citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a director of the police in the Washington area, DC recently said: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radicalization process, it has been found that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremist group believes that terrorists are true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or denied by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">"" "" "" "if we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop people to go to the mosque." ""</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>

<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a man, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>

<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she wanted to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every minister with whom she spoke brought her silence, and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Nothing inspired and something that would have made sense to her anger was her main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam re-establishes the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them of their anger, he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect each other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neurological studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian system of government, conformity and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows: if people submit messages in which negatively about Muslims have been reported, they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood against Muslims shot at the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society which has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>

<seg id="409">Before air packet delivery penetrated into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft at Frac Centre in France has built a six-metre high tower of 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting each other, airplanes reach high speed and acceleration in the tightest of spaces.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build resilient structures on your own.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear burdens, deal with turbulence and in general react to laws of nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of possible in an autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to function autonomously, it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, an offshoot of our labs.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the space, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available on the highest level e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called stern starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device trying to hit two flies with one flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other star cursors, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters it can float, and therefore has great advantages in start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear-starters is that they are sensitive to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the flight device does not matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be, for example, what is the smallest possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled flight machines, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with just one worked.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the mono-internal, the most mechanically simple remote-operated flight device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and transverse rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">However, it does not have the elegant hedge algorithm of the stern starters. to make it fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of throwing it right, if all watch me is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the bun is an exercise in contentment, this machine is here, the bus with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is very symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">In this way, it receives the external ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course he is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some things can be seen in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely secure and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two propeller flying machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">If something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller comes out, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making a half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic flocks.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine over there would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the wage is in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>

<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, in a very distant galaxy, two black holes circled faster and faster, transforming the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second into pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they lightened more brightly than all the stars along in all galaxies of the entire known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us classify events in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, a multi-cell life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has produced quite a few things: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands by us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago a group especially courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy genius, so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the Laser Interferometer-gravitational-waves observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following years, the precision of Ligo could be significantly increased, which greatly improved the detection performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to solve some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the detector was commissioned, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes ruled through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my toying father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In essence, they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational-waves from black holes and their signals with observatories like Ligo measurable signals for 23 years. what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a ripple in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">While passing the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and the other is stowed.</seg>
<seg id="495">Tutors in courses on the theory of relativity often lead to a really silly dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and sprayed at hitting the waves. the stretching of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is called 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. that's why one explained the Ligo associates for nuts.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than one thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because you can make a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light around you from several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">This is different with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">Your child's face, for example.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics like pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now Alice is speaking." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob is breaking them off." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies lie in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies very fast, you hear the same chirp with an additional key change. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement of movement, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14th, 2015 -- a date at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender sound] Anyone who knows what to listen to, recognizes this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30 times solar mass, which rotate approximately as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us consider briefly what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling a hundred times per second before colliding.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe, as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in space -- practical or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about them all.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen in the nucleus hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through because these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">The Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the Big Bang is hidden by his own illuminating light.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the aid of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that there are things that we have never seen before, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt, which we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that cause black holes, like ligament watching them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the dust bones for our archaeological work so to speak.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different view of the events of the universe, the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circus of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us?</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried out an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say" "" "Yes" "" "to everything I was afraid of." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">"" "no matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say" "" "yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of was getting rid of my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to hold speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes" "" "has changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes, which changed my life deeply, to an unexpected kind. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "treasures" "" "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "pussy, I need milk for my beak cup." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked her once if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the Beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">From then on, I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, to my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" say to playing with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am the author. I think things out, awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream television. I produce TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in a grand style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season, I am responsible for putting out 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days at four shows, therefore every nine days 20 million dollar television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes simultaneous in production, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series are running successively on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are programs that I have created myself and not only produced, so still overhead. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around campfires and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you now run a company, a country or a classrooms, a business or a household, take me seriously, and it's true when I say: I understand that I am not dreaming about a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm deepened into the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops, as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As if you had a high tone, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best thing about it is the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzzing begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could go for ever on it.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I declare them the hum that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, you do it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzzing -- when I started to work and work, build, create and collaborate, I discovered that thing, this buzz, this energy. the buzzing!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">Buzzing is action and activity. the buzzing is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzzing is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is the voice of God in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you can't look different to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being different than striving for size doesn't matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is what you call the totals.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it's ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it's the fear of a failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know I'm not made for failure, and I just know that I love buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make it clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I must work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the buzzing, the buzzing, the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this hum. I love the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the hum. I am the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this humming?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overstressed, overstated, burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mommy is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "Harper tells people:" "" "my mom will not be there, but you can write to my nanny." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "pussy, I want to go to Shonda-Land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the buzzing ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The engine buzzled.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My money was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no regret, nothing to delegate, a Titan does not sleep, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect titanium.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a flagship Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no more fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fades?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "haste you, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you work, you love what you do, being a teacher, a painter, to be a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, one loves another, and that's how the humming feels when you know the hum when the humming stops, who is you?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart listens, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern state waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out late and she says," "" "Mama, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she did not call me "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no one more "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan and my buzz smokes, and here everything changes before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mama, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about this.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it's outstanding because my pain and my panic, loneliness and lack of money, I can't do anything but watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl gets in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door enters and an energy boost enters.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzzing slowly comes back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzz, but a buzzword.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzzing, the hum, the titanium hum, this is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself using broadcasts and TV hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzzing is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real humming depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the current that comes from the lust for life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real humming is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real hum ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do it as a rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the humming again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not enough to me as they work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I am better at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what kind of person is working better than being at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">To be honest, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed, none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We race around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst the bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">In doing so, I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always go to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I wonder: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it too! always say yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you think me naively, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It's just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And when my teen-daughter talks to me for 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It's just 15 minutes, more does not need it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can spend 15 minutes a day, even on a bad day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes of the play!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no clothes, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to go.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are included!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the buzz of having a place for peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "to" "" "play" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and preserve it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I win. meeting friends, reading books, enjoying the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in education when I wanted to surpass myself more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece, why not allow yourself 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The hum came back in my spare time. the buzzing seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The Summing of Life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The Summing of Love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The buzz of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is snowy to me that I am a Titan. I've never seen a Titan that is going to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to play more.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children are.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer my head is.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the totals. the land I create, the marathon, I run, the troops, the screens, the high sound, the buzzing, the buzzing, the other, the right hum: the buzzing of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, lasting, naked and new feeling of life is spreading in me. less titanium -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel that humming, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I'm a writer. I think things out, I'll stir you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is part of the job, which means living his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a bit dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "to less work and to play more." ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, in contrast to other body organs, has a very low self-healing ability.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have one of the most well-known, the "brain stimulation." in doing so, one implanted an electrode deep in the brain to influence the neurons' circuitry so that the neurological function improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease who suffered from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was senior physician and worked day and night in emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that cranium-brain trauma will swell the brain and increase cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, it is necessary to reduce cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this you sometimes need to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to use Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyze brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children, which are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and the surroundings in order to be able to flourish.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François managed.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly spread and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cellular population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they keep us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them colourfully in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we reimported them at the outlet point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call autologous transplant -- automatic transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we reimport these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we reimport the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we re-imported the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury to and reimported exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimported.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells we dye in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we couldn't stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we passed the motor skills range in the motoric cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralysed, they couldn't move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralysed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, as is the case with the ape.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you can see the monkey who spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance before the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">See now that we reimported the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that this was also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to imitate it in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a nearly professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First of all, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select patients who perform treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First, it is necessary to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for your visit with TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them unchangeable.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics is completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "in fact, democracy is dwindling with us, in Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally made clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- did not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my adessionate friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save democracy but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Without democracy, our societies will become brighter, our future gloomy, and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic of extravagance, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which is currently threatening our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin peaks paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognise the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the high net worth savers and corporations, which, however, are too scary to invest where it would be productive and income that could produce all the things that humanity desperately needs, such as green energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, in the USA, in England and the eurozone, 3.4 trillion US dollars were invested in all prosperity producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, rail, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">$3.4 trillion sounds after a lot of money until one compares it with the $5.1 trillion dollars that at the same time were lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except to inflate stock markets and hustle the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not equated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the U.S., Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand, which, as in a continuous loop, encourages the pessimism of investors, which might be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally the circumstances will cause him to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my Hades with Capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His very wasteful art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and, in particular, to finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, the Athenian democracy included too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "however, it would be a mistake to reduce the value of the Athenian democracy on the basis of these exclusions." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive factor in the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they granted them the right to political participation with the same mood in question of state concerns.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian Democracy has not been held for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that glows very brightly, it is quickly burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="937">"" "" "" "however, today's liberal democracies have not their roots in ancient Athens," ""</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy first came up as a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In today's democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two is taking place, while the economy gradually undergoes politics and distorts it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not up to a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because it can be in the government these days, and yet not in power, because the power is diverted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my Hades with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of predators that sustainably decimated the animals from which it feeds, that it is starved at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has harmed the policy so far that it harms itself by the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods are depreciated, the overall economic demand falls, and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest in the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea by the way.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only gain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economics and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks become higher, the waste becomes more sublime, and the social conflicts are deeper, as it is -- very soon as I think -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">We have to reorganise the economy and reunite the spheres of business and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunified field, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy, which makes the film "Matrix" appear as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that he has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopie, similar to that in "matrix," in which machines serve humans and human beings stick their energy into the research of the universe, or into a high-tech version of ancient Athenians "Agora," in long discussions the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be, how could it look to have this Star Trek-like utopia instead of the "matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In the practical implementation I would like to give you some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of the company: please introduce yourself to a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one office to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which you are currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income comes from capital and revenue, and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction is made between those who belong to the company, but they do not work in it, and employees who work there, who do not belong to the company. no more exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and saving, and ultimately no twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please briefly imagine that our national currencies have a free fluctuating exchange rate in a universal, global, digital currency that is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that all world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it the cosmos, in units of "cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world in which investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, especially against the backdrop of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time liberal, in which it favors privileged people, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash bin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world?</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it more democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economics is... Do we not do this, technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which means Larry Summers as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant.</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I'm a liberal Marxist, and as Keynes, and that's why I'm also totally swirling.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you're not mad, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: it's a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers said you very clearly what you think from the West's point of view in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most is happening -- the sphere of economy -- is a fully democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In some ways, if I can say that provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now pretending to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century smells enormously after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Greece's finance ministers at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I sensed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing as we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">That is to say good-bye to the complacency and the continual denial that a massive fault line went through the eurozone, and continues to drastically threaten the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which by the way, was the first proposal to reveal this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Euro Group, have chosen the denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the changes occur, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you anticipate?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any minister who, after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the motion for renewal of the debt recovery program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But there was no such thing.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They just wanted to overthrow our government, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that were running through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been implementing a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "it is worse than during the" "" "Great Depression" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the troika's Troika, who imposed this policy on us, admitted:" "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive sound of the talks, you seem to be still pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they do not survive, the liberated centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to adopt the way of a post-modern 1930, after which it appears to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for having been with TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Roy Price has never heard most of them, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19th 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision Roy had met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfriser and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "Movies, TV, Technique, Tacos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for picking the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can't choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He must find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the valuation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows this rating is received.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is judged by nine and above, it will be a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addicted to where after you have stowed a relay, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like Toddlers and Tiaras -- -- that should tell you enough what's going on at that end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to entertain "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the middle payload, average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't enthuse.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure he's really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it's the first time Amazon is doing something like that, so Roy price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where they can watch everyone free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon fiddles out for nothing, it's up to you, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team that record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you jump over or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process it, and this is the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom about four Republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha is landing at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked on.</seg>
<seg id="1073">Approximately at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top-show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organizing a contest, he and his team have looked at the existing data about the Netflix audience, the reviews they give to the shows, their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, what producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four Senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "house of Cards" "" "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go." ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what is happening here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it through very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least one can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then this is a little frightening because we live in a time when we reach more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the Multi-Health system here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room. come into contact with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in the United States and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad will be decided if a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Mediocre TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always producing the best results. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that data analysis outbreaks of flu, the worst kind, could predict -- through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">"" "it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. success culminated in a publication in the magazine" "" "Nature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year by year, until it suddenly stopped working,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply didn't work, this was another sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data rapidly flows into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the enforcement of law, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly need two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, put this problem into its components so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, you put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to re-assemble the parts and then come to a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to be put together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think Netflix was so successful because they have used data and reason where they belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, which they would otherwise not have been capable of. but the decision on how to take all these parts back together and make a show like "House of Cards" does not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they were competing for TV ideas, then when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order to not forget this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no-question, you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "highly probable" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will then dig it out with a technical demonstration later.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made a few decisions in my life, with which I should have heard in hindsight on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with something much smarter, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">In the end, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this is very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what you are doing and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
