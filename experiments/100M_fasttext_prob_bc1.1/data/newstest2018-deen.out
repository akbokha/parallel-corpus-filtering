Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people should meet today .
a cryp@@ t where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it gets nervous when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this , who had to get upset , because the car navigation device showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but very informative .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pair of Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ ich , which one does not recognize as such .
for cities and municipalities detailed maps , so @-@ called sent@@ encing leaves , were incorporated into the large map .
these were created according to the Bavarian surve@@ ying administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and the first surve@@ ying of Bavaria .
your principal : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops were finally dra@@ fted with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on 9 February 18@@ 01 they were today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max . Joseph further drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian surve@@ ying administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the copyright sheet for Munich dates back to the year 18@@ 56 and is to be found like all others on the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek &apos;s website .
the comparison of early / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was established as a Munich subur@@ b for 21 years after the map was created .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling lies in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 on today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first sight : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller @-@ part card with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered fl@@ utes from the so @-@ called &quot; original photograph &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots there are no more farmers today - but farmers in the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land in the sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the October festival , was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; on the guest &apos;s dough &quot; or &quot; On the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld street people once locked up people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich District Ir@@ ren@@ aissance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Venti@@ lation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard of Gu@@ dden conducted the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive in his time , and for example ended the ban@@ quet of so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he prohibited the personnel from applying violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients , there was first place , later extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was insufficient - the reason for the construction of the Cir@@ cles in Hair 1905 .
the Is@@ ar Amp@@ er Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 .
young people meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ anism area on the site of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities .
West is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was erected - in architectural reference to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ asylum , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bom@@ bing attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was registered as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lied bombs broke many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line @-@ line .
with the sli@@ der you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil Rights group publishes Travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ ms has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i because of the discrimin@@ atory politics and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ ians to pay special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , racial @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; stated in the Group &apos;s statement .
a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people more difficult to win discrimination law@@ suits , as well as the state law enforcement agencies which dispro@@ portion@@ ately target minorities , caused the group to publish the travel warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
the group quoted incidents like rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during the journey and was put into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i General At@@ tor@@ ney Office showing that black mot@@ ori@@ sts in the state are 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be prepared if they bring ch@@ ewing money or let relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 Hass@@ an crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the Hass@@ an @-@ report of the FB@@ I , which classi@@ fy the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company due to housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws that would obli@@ ge local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing in view of the AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently , interest groups have deployed the measure in response to certain laws and trends in the United States .
turn@@ down project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s Di@@ dez@@ v@@ ous Project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have created a picture on site .
representatives of the CD@@ U local association gathered together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties at the pi@@ vot@@ al court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially granted insight into his operation , where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk cows and as many young animals and houses the guests in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exclusively regi@@ on@@ ales are placed on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V president of the fisher@@ man &apos;s bach , he described the fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamental importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot manage to profit profit@@ ably on such steep faces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the green area care for a lot of work , much needs to be processed with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental plant and cultivated it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it does not lead a biogas plant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the significance of the turn@@ around project and is glad about the Leader promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers should be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the land could be extended for quite a while . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often in criticism because of fo@@ stering
a total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants in 2013 .
the surface area is therefore 40 hectares , which may not be aff@@ or@@ ested by at least 20@@ 23 .
half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was promoted by the leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 km of wheat fence .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and farm women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiß asser@@ ted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Sequ@@ ence Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the government to promote public f@@ ences .
the aim is to preserve the Black Forest .
the pre@@ condition is the existence of a conveying set indicated by the L@@ PR .
moreover , the area to be protected may not be worse ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by for@@ estation .
for the Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s For@@ tun@@ ic project in 2018 , the application consists of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence .
the accounting area is equivalent to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 1@@ 12@@ ,000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes on the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged down@@ fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump ré@@ gi@@ me , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals to dras@@ tically restrict the legal migration to the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue himself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have landed him if he had done it .
but he gra@@ b@@ bed their importance , and in particular the meaning attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the memorial , was added to his base .
when Miller told A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete affair about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to is added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is properly speaking , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite some old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , your oppressed masses , longing to breathe freely , the mis@@ erable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : indeed , it is a conflict about the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends , who used to place their words on the base after her death - knew very well that she performed a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classic depic@@ tion .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in its poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty didn &apos;t invite anybody , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative that puts the American flame into the re@@ counted world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it is intended to bear the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not light the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh found something unusual here .
the meaning of the statue is completely and even a matter of point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them in such a way as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ event@@ ful , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue says to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever would like to acknowledge .
their torch should not light the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members one time when only two Scot@@ s@@ men belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the UK Ath@@ le@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship header &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special is developed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue until we find it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they &apos;ve done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m distance , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their Captain speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought up naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver Med@@ al winner , who will compete in their fifth world champion@@ ships at 400 m Hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the UK team .
Scotland &apos;s best overall number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ stream @-@ runner Mu@@ ir leads along this path and last year has established five British and two European records .
it will take part in the 1.500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1.500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champion@@ ships when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their fellow coun@@ try@@ men are not only part of the team , but also in some cases will be involved in the med@@ als and the fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes , who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums .
as for my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think it went well .
I have only pointed out that in this situation we are very happy as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympiast@@ adion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking critics on Facebook : do not worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers hit him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he cri@@ es in criticism , certainly .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led as sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who must work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 persons , who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and that is why the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union canc@@ eled it earlier this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an over@@ power@@ ing democratic state which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair @-@ loose head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the block@@ age of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , is known as officially and by employees paid with public tax dollars - need@@ less and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of tro@@ lls or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post talked to some of the real people that were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no tro@@ lls .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful , and not prof@@ ane .
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t like this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are desp@@ ised by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when the same thing had been done that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical ly@@ ri@@ tics and to arrest and silence demonstr@@ ators .
but that &apos;s exactly what is happening in digital .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable port had a similar effect on the internet .
the number of newspapers was multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters t@@ ach@@ ograph@@ s beat him .
and even then Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
people using pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , who critic@@ ised his position on the Am@@ ity Treaty , trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his ministry , according to the historical documents collected by the online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the foundation of our nation .
and true guidance means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led the Arch@@ er@@ field to the final round next year , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it is in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he found this place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura L because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to European Senior tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the promotion on homeland .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer by passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
this is the result of scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases are attributable to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in comparison , he drew up his own study on this issue from 1994 .
at that time there have been more than 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
construction works in Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; lie somewhat at the time , &quot; says Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house @-@ connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not indicated in the plans .
traffic , which repeatedly hin@@ ders construction work , represents a major problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ ori@@ sts in front of red lights and barriers is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are entitled to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z of the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were already very exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold country
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent in the troubled in@@ don@@ esian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife normally establishes a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the knot@@ ted tu@@ ber is taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - it has no furniture - where it also performs its daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a roof@@ ed room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many are drinking hard , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote by a public elevation in front of the occupation forces .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal supervis@@ ors .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea that included the eastern part of the island .
the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rental car .
there is no public transport .
the city , with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants , consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo enclosures and made of corrugated sheets , which were converted into various yel@@ low@@ ish tones by rust .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes .
&quot; we weren &apos;t used to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we only had sheets on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold country .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has min@@ ed gold and copper in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has over wood resources worth a estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost $ 20 million for local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 15@@ 0,000 in one single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ ua &apos;s demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten those golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tribal high@@ land in the 1970 &quot; s were committed to genocide in accordance with the Asia human rights commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Are Every@@ thing Rel@@ ating &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is stated in a report by the arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric charges are particularly popular after another report - and brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as every week incidents occur , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased since Pap@@ ua &apos;s resources bring a stream of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is at 83 % Christian , but the demographic development is changing since Muslim economic migrants are coming from the most popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ p cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 year old Pan@@ i@@ ai local who moved to the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has ta@@ sted the native Pap@@ ua - the mom@@ my mother &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ the@@ i , promised to address the ine@@ qualities and bre@@ aches of law in Pap@@ ua during his campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter captured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on their way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but little has changed in Pap@@ ua , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; our hearts have been broken because we voted Jok@@ the@@ i in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ the@@ i &apos;s inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols before a camp fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke down on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers participated in their tone and later returned to four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt was T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , ch@@ ased and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so badly hit that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby Government Commission was set ali@@ ght and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bows and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in circles continuously and im@@ i@@ ti@@ zing a bird song - from Pap@@ ua &apos;s Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to sling stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers by an internal radio : &quot; if the masses afford more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official TI@@ ME document that was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his brigh@@ tly painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ame hasn &apos;t yet known who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ eel , who , like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , carries only one name , the TI@@ ME in a glo@@ omy atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw him being dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted only &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the news of the kill@@ ings came to Jak@@ arta on the following day .
three weeks later , Jok@@ ov@@ i in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura had a passionate talk in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical mis@@ fortun@@ es in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he will establish an extra@@ judicial mechanism for resol@@ ving historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and beginning of the 2000 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must be tra@@ vers@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to with@@ drew as he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , saying that he had no plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wi@@ ran@@ to , who accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 victims of death in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody dependence on independence in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been settled in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims asser@@ ted such alleg@@ ations with gri@@ m un@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ eel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military searched for me , &quot; he says .
the shooting did not stop .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a building contractor who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s sit@@ ing bure@@ au .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warnings .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the wounded were delivered quickly here , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden myself in my house for two days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called on the officers involved to account and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile bri@@ g@@ ade from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an im@@ print enterprise for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribal people Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ el who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua @-@ Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by increasing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody in recent years , under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of sweet potato respectively .
they retain the bulk of the crop for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
in the course of time economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived at the Nab@@ ire airport in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own businesses .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Go@@ bai , chairman of the tribal council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
beyond that , restrictions on media coverage remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ den and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given the rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ er &apos;s electoral campaign to highlight the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ safe east@@ ern@@ most provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa @-@ ref@@ using and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ ua . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six Pacific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai sho@@ ot@@ ings .
the same countries have historically supported O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ tha N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; there is still a democratic system in Indonesia , and there are free media so that it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights attacks . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , attended by the Human Rights Ambassador of K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session , but want to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election for 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua states that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ the@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ the@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Go@@ bai , chairman of the tribal council .
he wants Jok@@ the@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from living under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , are in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ bai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ the@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Vic@@ tims led a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of an victim was buried in an area exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they will never give justice to them , but at least they will not forget their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire cap@@ tures the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per of Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest living towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 metre high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire which , in just two years , swe@@ eps through the sky@@ scra@@ per , which is rightly called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ches tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; said a resident who called his name George ang@@ ler , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 clock ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said that she worked on providing shelter for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damages came from the cl@@ adding , the outer covering for decoration or insulation .
in the UK , the police said that the system of plates for isolation and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : continuing Best @-@ of @-@ Five
the president of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has passed through its large Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Meeting .
at the Ho @-@ Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the revolutionary proposal for this sport was to play Davis Cup single only on two wins , very thin@@ ly supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
these often very long , but also very much appreciated five @-@ set classics are thus preserved to the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire Reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the applications .
not until the vote did the proposal come before the proposal to apply the final on a neutral place .
the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host right next year in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements are facilit@@ ated in terms of training places , etc . and players will have to do less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 passengers carry prohibited items on the plane , finding out a survey
a survey among air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent of know@@ led@@ geable or un@@ consciously prohibited items are s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled past the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent of the aircraft entered while they inad@@ vert@@ ently wore knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had discovered delayed that they were mistakenly using fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey carried out at more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet @-@ charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , - also stated that younger travellers would rather dis@@ regard the rules .
from the respon@@ dents , who admitted they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als were compared with less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were .
the most common items that have been intentionally passed on to T@@ SA agents were food and fluids .
more than 3 percent reported to have know@@ ingly carried articles with blades by security control while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es also confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs to the aircraft .
the company said it inter@@ viewed travelers throughout the country to find out how many inad@@ vert@@ ently picked up s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled goods by airport security and how many would have done it intentionally .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely to s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - bear through security , those who fly most frequently .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure what fluids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of objects conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden fluids .
for a while the people thought that T@@ SA could watch books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; electric @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to deal with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has so far suggested that some of the clients have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever @-@ trium@@ ph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ yed another , less gl@@ it@@ tering number in the announcement of the latest quar@@ terly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
during the past few months , Mus@@ k had frequently recru@@ ited more than 500@@ ,000 orders for the new car , whose delivery just started .
now , Mus@@ k conc@@ edes : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot;
at present 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations , Mus@@ k cleaned up in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to now around twelve per cent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
2018 - all models will be put together - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 one million .
the demand for this is evident .
according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1,@@ 800 reservations per day .
if you order a Model 3 today , you may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines tested in practice without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if there are too much delays , then the non @-@ binding of the reservations might become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA Head P@@ ru@@ itt re@@ trac@@ ts due to the postpon@@ ement of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after he was filed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the environmental protection authority , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous post in a Federal Court of App@@ eal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a period running on 1 October for States to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay adher@@ ence to a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who before his appointment as President Donald Tr@@ ump prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt repeatedly passed over to block or delay regul@@ ators that oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal back @-@ down for the P@@ ru@@ itts &apos;s regulatory roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of App@@ eal in Washington decided that the EPA ste@@ ward exceeded his authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply reflects the willingness of the EPA for co @-@ operation with the States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , EPA has often failed to comply with dead@@ lines and then waited to be charged by activists and others , and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who def@@ aul@@ ted the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority we give to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the EPA statement said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authorisation to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the O@@ zone rules .
a draft bill approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet decided in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states who had su@@ ed the EPA this week , said the group intended to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g flowing into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of the public health care system and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered about P@@ ru@@ ism &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from those responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to turn to environmental poll@@ s and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ bling celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius &apos;s Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the town , the historic St. Hil@@ arius complex is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ische Manu@@ eline : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ gt@@ ei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wording of the document , on the mountain of Tum@@ linger , apart from the former parish church , there was also a noble court to which the Church or the Pat@@ ron@@ ate Law belonged , and not vice versa .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ les , the &quot; Berg &quot; of the third , the noble settlement nucle@@ us of the village .
old maps dating back to 1600 re @-@ substanti@@ ate these historical facts .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval church law .
a master who built , fitted out a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could bequ@@ e@@ ath this church .
as a result , the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two was broken at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later had to be left in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) window pan@@ es were sm@@ ashed and the bells were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops en@@ camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church mill and used it as a fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger &apos;s Hil@@ arius cemetery was also used as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed .
only the bell tower was left standing .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 a storm split the steep@@ le and half collap@@ sed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the tower @-@ wer@@ g still existing today remained the witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius facility by Dieter D@@ ock@@ horn as successor of Dieter D@@ ock@@ horn .
as organizers , the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gens invite to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle cemetery on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery .
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler high school Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann is talking about the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3 : 30 p.m .
to the end of the ser@@ en@@ ade a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers put out the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ser@@ en@@ ade only takes place in dry weather .
the organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius complex , which is important to Tum@@ ble and Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to the care of their home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini affir@@ ms .
association wants to check the approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal pre@@ condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; association has called on Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at that time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind power concentration camp existed .
in this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration camp causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
such zones are intended to prevent &quot; par@@ don &quot; of the landscape .
a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided to change the area of land use a second wind turbine concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette - but this had not authorized the district government of Düsseldorf because of a mold missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirement , the granted approval letter is still illegal and therefore also withdrawn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council again resolved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where the issue of approval for the construction of wind turbines is excluded as planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since last week the letters have been received by the Vier@@ sen district , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle makes it an occasion to re@@ consider the matter again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argument of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a NEW subsidiary company , is planning to build four 200 @-@ metre high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen participated indirectly , closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be met - that corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity demand of all four @-@ thous@@ ander households .
new Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Kreis Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ m@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two more people were injured .
the provincial road remained closed for hours .
according to police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her passenger car drove the L 3@@ 33 towards Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying person .
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city centre in September .
the trade association and city administration intend to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to l@@ ure the inhabitants for shopping in the city centre .
as the president of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend aims to sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers what offers the city &apos;s own city away from the usual supermarket commodity .
therefore , a market with regional providers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local firms should present themselves with their training vac@@ an@@ cies .
in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite for &quot; mid@@ day shopping . &quot;
the campaign aims not only on residents of the city and the nearby region .
in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags , which refer to the action weekend , says Christian König .
the City Council and the Business Association co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
thus the commercial association and the city go into a further stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive downtown . &quot;
this includes new offerings such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; to the well @-@ known well @-@ established Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ men and hosts in order to move them to active participation .
attractive offers for Saturday and the aband@@ on@@ ment of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials are to be re@@ opened or re@@ opened .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center when shopping .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to li@@ ven the city center - to land@@ lords , the businesses of the whole city and clubs .
it was rewar@@ ding to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that partly broad@@ ened , king said in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , Director of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities will take part in the third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advertise for the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her buying behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school

Tr@@ ump loc@@ ates after le@@ aked tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January Tr@@ ump called in a telephone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to stop publicly decl@@ aring that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the US president insul@@ ted him because he had den@@ ounced the wall publicly . according to reports , he said to him : &quot; you can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
the tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees to emig@@ rate to Australia is &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was arranged by the Obama administration , would make him look like a &quot; dump@@ site &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump closed the call after he told Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists perform rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ching act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in the Mon@@ ro@@ e countryside , Georgia , and turned to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver to reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ obs - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train on his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors , the in@@ mates were in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
cri@@ es broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger &apos;s seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene played on July 22nd is just one night away .
but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all of them hit very real si@@ ghs in the audience .
since 2005 , civil rights activists have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were har@@ med by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person has been arrested - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps the organisation of post @-@ production .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of the State of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
for him , the post @-@ employment serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that an injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to stop , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot go to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a for@@ en@@ sic doctor lays a blanket on the cor@@ p@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and surrounding mo@@ wers were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching process .
but none was ever tried .
although the susp@@ ects have been on the loose for decades , citizens activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a ruling by the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the sum@@ mer@@ ing election campaign in the summer .
about at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the FB@@ I of the black color monitor Roger Mal@@ com landed a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ or in the city had been that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy , and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they got away from prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b ring@@ ed the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and removing the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , it will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the yearly follow @-@ up of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their presentation is illustr@@ ative , po@@ ign@@ ant and is rooted in a sort of deep rac@@ ism , many of which want to believe that it no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t establish a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I &apos;ve gone through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of chief @-@ clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive , because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , the actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the ne@@ sts scre@@ ams and pus@@ hes him fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- it van@@ ished from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rep@@ lies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all the black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs lou@@ dly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ cona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think that white people then said &apos; n --- &apos; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy doing this right not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharply and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition is violent and fast .
there are cri@@ es , shots and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman clothed with a mour@@ ning dress is standing above the bodies of the actors and carries out Bil@@ lie holidays &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks in every second word .
about one hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen viewers wi@@ pes out sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many just down the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity for almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ ds took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body &apos;s body .
children sit on their heads , register the bo@@ g@@ us blood and the silent body and whis@@ per one another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wants to remember it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ching rope and wipe off their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ hid embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks out with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sit together with the actors for dinner .
a white pair of Atlanta chat@@ ting at a table excit@@ edly chat@@ ting about the Nach@@ stellung with a black pair they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words that had left a sense of performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these horrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ching is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today this is called only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds court at his table , he eats and rec@@ alls the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ employment is in a certain way inspir@@ ational because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf is set on a colorful fri@@ vol@@ ous st@@ aging in front of a gigantic six @-@ story setting .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by A@@ lek@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows either a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner together with the Wall of the Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Play@@ list and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car is par@@ ked in which the Rhein@@ h@@ unters pose as rock @-@ ergi@@ r@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels are reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - which moves through its &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging .
the three Rhein@@ h@@ unters - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize beautifully as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
K@@ ES@@ S perform Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , dis@@ assemble a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ fashion and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the wonderfully nasty Ha@@ gen surrounding the aura of a heavy weight punching bag .
brut@@ ally the scene , when he shot Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) still has to believe it .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause .
Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are celebrated in a stor@@ my fashion , who humble himself and for@@ est@@ all the hands of Angela Merkel .
there is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in light of the great heat again in casual leisure clothes .
the gig was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team .
in 2013 he had to leave a g@@ able pipe concert over himself , there were five years later great jubil@@ ation , in which the scattered &quot; bu@@ h &quot; rep@@ ut@@ ations went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the public did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its perception .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max amount works as a volunteer
they work in several places at the same time as a volunteer .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture exchange , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked on the school in the open whole day .
how are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
you are now 26 years , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that come about ?
amount : I did a S@@ LC .
and then a civil engineer &apos;s degree , let &apos;s say , successfully demoli@@ shed .
I realized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , at the focal point maybe also , really .
and was it so ?
amount : I collected some great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I am going to study dual , probably doing a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it probably depends on where you are doing the FS@@ J .
it can be done from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon supervision .
for me it was exactly the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
in contrast to studies in civil engineering ?
a lot : sure , here it &apos;s not about calculating st@@ atics .
you always have other people in front of you , each having a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee or a young person who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have reservations ?
quantity : for this I am not the type .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , great kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is like that .
Pear@@ son pl@@ ung@@ es another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut off her interim dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .
the job reduction , which Director General John Fall@@ on announced chi@@ ef@@ ly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced a cost reduction plan for a further 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) in a third cost reduction program in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace to digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ vo@@ y attack : NATO soldier killed in suicide bom@@ bing
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a soldier of NATO and injured several others , says officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , shared an explanation by NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ Arab quarter .
the bom@@ bing is the last violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a Her@@ at mos@@ que on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a NATO statement , it is said that the explosion happened on Thursday evening when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive force . &quot;
the statement states that all injuries are in a stable state and be treated in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the UN , at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties occurred in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bomb blast killed at least 30 people in a mostly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had carried out this attack .
on 31 May a massive bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most le@@ thal milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops in 2001 pushed the Tali@@ ban off power .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump atten@@ ds to increase the number of U.S. troops that support military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies , and in particular the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to law@@ suits
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled that the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this occurred a day after 15 states compl@@ ained to the Agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Rules 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said it shows the agency &apos;s commitment to co @-@ operate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to measure the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in a part of the country , in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the Columbia district , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of the democr@@ ats and nature reserves , wor@@ rying about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air containing o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
community wants community room
at the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts , the Common at Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ tz@@ en appro@@ ves the establishment of a community space in the future retirement home .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing part of the property is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will still take a long time until the church community has so far been part of the community , there is no planning obstacle for the project to be st@@ em@@ med by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common space .
one of the two investors still in the boat offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - some 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council are ho@@ vering that such a community space cannot be seen as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ent housing , but openly into the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the rounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision , which was already decided by the provision of funds for the current budget in the last autumn , will be swe@@ pt aside by funding opportunities .
the building is located in the rehabilitation area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a common room would be , so reports T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proposal fores@@ ees to signal the investor , that in this respect it is not possible to throw a bil@@ let between the legs , the statement that both saddle and pitch roof - as well as pent roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible .
not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer thinks that this addition is unnecessary .
if it helps : he passes the body unanim@@ ously .
it &apos;s not that easy with the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many of his own buildings with which one does not get so well ahead , but now you lean out of the window at the community room , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really doing it with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger speaks for the common room - but absolutely against communal participation .
it sees behind it a covered subsi@@ dy to investors anyway , or even foreign investors .
this is not so , because with the purchase of the space one does not grant a subsi@@ dy , but gets a real equivalent in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
at the same time , Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s proposal to ple@@ ad the proposal is made up of three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
this is the case with two counter@@ parts in the original program , which summari@@ zes Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; if we handle the decision , we make a huge step in closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision by car : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was seized by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and severely injured .
as the police rus@@ hed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road from the Schwar@@ zer Weg to Hil@@ den on the cycle path of the Schwar@@ zer Road .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the bush on the Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver , driving in the same direction , granted priority to him .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder hit the road , he apparently did not pay attention to the opposite traffic .
he came together with a car that ste@@ ered a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital by a chari@@ ot .
FC Bayern Munich must refra@@ in from taking the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup does not take place without him : David Al@@ aba must let the game take action against Dortmund .
with personnel matters , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first compulsory game of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Cup against the Cup winner .
the staff of the German football record team Bayern München are getting bigger before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti does not have to wai@@ ve David Al@@ aba in a du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
the Co@@ ins are also missing Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , cel@@ li@@ otti has made responsible for the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the team &apos;s balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last but not least , that was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelli@@ gently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is expecting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football @-@ heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
hiking in the resin from star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created in the resin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the association &quot; Observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg . &quot;
there is a planet path in Göttingen , since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to meet the information needs of many har@@ z@@ go@@ ers was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Star Path &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inquiry into question boxes St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the panels is to be updated via the internet .
this is why a good mobile network receipt is essential for selecting location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the orbit@@ al path should be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path , the viewers experience a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more light than another , although it was considerably far@@ ther away .
I will also medi@@ ate in which con@@ stellation a selected star finds itself and when it is best to see .
since 2014 , the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest situated observ@@ atory of Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
in the university town of Göttingen there has been something similar to the planet &apos;s path since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen .
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the Observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; off @-@ ground &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to to the d@@ warf planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and the standard of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the exact 75 meters distance the sun measures 70 centimet@@ ers .
the entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometres .
while the light takes about eight hours from the sun to the Plu@@ to , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next fixed star would last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to face a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future , were met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , went down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super spring weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ division world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday in Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia put out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ on@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ ma noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not that big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that &apos;s what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko was right .
&quot; boxes need this struggle . &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 Po@@ und debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interested in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their weight @-@ weight title fight in the Forum on 23 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans have asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and later pressed openly to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he appreci@@ ates Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; and he may participate in his Saturday struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko believed in the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to co @-@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact , then boxing .
both said they could feel the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injuries to T@@ ire Plat@@ zer
in the event of an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were severely injured on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the connection point in front of the connection point of the market .
the passenger hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he over@@ came and then stayed on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was blocked in the direction of the north for about an hour , then traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener against Braunschweig to point out the optimization of the defensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first round of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , since not the two opponents had been against Braunschweig at 2 : 2 .
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to look even better in Au@@ e , &quot; says Fort@@ una Düsseldorf &apos;s def@@ enders .
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the triangle is also to be further optimized .
and the For@@ tun@@ en don &apos;t want to catch a fool after a breach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no one faces Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that after the experience in preparation with the three chain , his team is better able to cope better than with the four @-@ chain chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t yet know how to operate in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is confident of his thing , &quot; because we are on the half@@ way positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gieß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we cannot afford so many errors in construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann will also drive to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but whether you can talk about a failed start after a draw , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could well be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can stand four points on Sunday and concentrate on the cup , we will surely be able to talk about a decent season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his coach didn &apos;t want to know about this .
&quot; I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days , &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el said , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be interrupted pre@@ mat@@ urely for a storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might be even a bit fres@@ her , as they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una for a favorite promotion in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know 100 % where they are currently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner def@@ enders of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland will be a light favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium in Au@@ e .
&quot; that we swe@@ ep them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six is non@@ sense , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is absolutely positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e out of nine games .
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ li@@ ga , which one has to beat from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as &apos;s chief coach .
&quot; making such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish Asyl@@ um App@@ lic@@ ants published
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who underwent a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( late @-@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should make the assessment of the age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ ration@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees that were minor .
to date , migration sales have ma@@ stered 6.@@ 8@@ 80 cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in more 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are conducted only in cases where the person &apos;s age is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the journal The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases judged by the person over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ ers have lied about their age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May the agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the person under investigation is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det investigated the 5@@ 81 published results , she realized that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , in which x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska @-@ Institute , whose work involves the evaluation of the biological maturity of people to see if they went sooner or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very un@@ safe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot confi@@ dently say , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is in@@ correctly assessed is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is if the person is under 18 , in that case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven ton concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the tram department and traffic in the District Office of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time on all three renovation needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end of the building is planned for October and is certain that the schedule is adher@@ ed to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a arch bridge made of concrete which is cla@@ d with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated .
the two other bridges cross the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red coloured sand@@ stone .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach now has a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven ton heavy so @-@ called bridge @-@ cap on Wednesday morning on the north side .
this is a constra@@ int mount , which is also used as an operating path .
on the southern part of the bridge a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge @-@ cap is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way should be gone .
the special thing about it is that it is finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
the laying of cables by the structure in Lau@@ ter@@ bach requires a special finger feeling .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable where many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project prior to the work .
in addition , fish and cru@@ st@@ ac@@ eans had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard building and the collecting field in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; hotels is completely closed .
the costs for the three bridges amount to 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest at German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented in the District Day of Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance , which shows peac@@ efully this day , because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell to the according poster &quot; great election campaign . &quot;
and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land is the leading duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September , and the deputy president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ voters but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the city picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain area , but now takes place in the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that is offered .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the Forum A World and one of the leading organisers , was really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; original potato salad , which the Af@@ D can easily eat , &quot; says the woman who brought him along .
the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the train station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes is reported by the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel , he stri@@ ves for such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already erected Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ s there are not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also done : at around 8@@ pm a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle , takes care of entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle diverse speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D president Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 people waiting for the top candidate for the German Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k holding their speeches .
the police presence remained unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
the Af@@ D event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is to be vac@@ ated shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can press down - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli exists in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ gigs tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets classical German training with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov is solo trump@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo pianist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire to not only cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
thus Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; unites itself with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , mixes classics , jazz and free playing into a fascinating synthesis of the arts .
this core of the programme was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately disper@@ sed bitter@@ ly .
despite all this , the brunette Dar@@ stell@@ erin ass@@ ures to the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with everyone I &apos;ve got .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I had played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their separation Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed this du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she particularly suffered during school , when she pre@@ fers to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I felt really attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; .
in particular , they do not like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to relate to a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me than@@ king me , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... Today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the demonstration broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a trainer I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump first announced a great announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not appro@@ ve the Democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued a statement in which it said : &quot; the party change of Govern@@ ors Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only fifteen provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement by Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is not able to find a positive , convincing message , &quot; said the R@@ NC chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be taken back into sport .
Russian Ath@@ le@@ tics chief D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ t@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who were taken away with gold and silver med@@ als in competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 following a report by the World Anti Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) having found evidence of state funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the repor@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation recognized for itself that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do all possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for his re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the time to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nin@@ ety Russian athletes will compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral stakeholders .
the leader of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for rein@@ statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ceremony for soldiers cut off in Mali
during a funeral service in F@@ ritz@@ lar , northern Hessen , around 1,000 people of the two soldiers killed by a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
Minister Ursul@@ a von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the un@@ resolved crash of fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons of their trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to the highest sacrifice they have brought in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied on Thursday accompanied by a guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the F@@ ritz@@ ker Cathedral of St. Peter .
at noon , only the members of the Church took leave .
thereafter , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr , as well as politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
ro@@ ses laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , F@@ ritz@@ ker and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defense of Le@@ yen called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann developed the flight operation of the helicopter Tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger drivers of his regi@@ ment .
Volker Bau@@ ers@@ k , the commander of the regi@@ ment , to which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if the crew couldn &apos;t turn the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Prime Minister of the Le@@ yen : the use was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country of which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this was shared by the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , and said it further in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he retired in 2016 and also covers the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; princ@@ ely ban@@ quet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not regard himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the boss of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London in 1965 .
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French embassy .
during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es .
Hen@@ rik wrote in an auto@@ biography about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk str@@ uts instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises that I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of corporate @-@ critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
that was equal to two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony
Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but does not want to res@@ ign .
he spoke out on Friday for the resolution of parliament .
prior to that , the surprising exit of a Green party from its parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its close one @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ westen combined her step with non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ur@@ l wants his faction to take it up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , CD@@ U and F@@ DP have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Parliament will be elected regular on the 14th of January next year .
Th@@ emin@@ der said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it could go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l is essential for the Parliament to decide his self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also shows the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament withdraw@@ s trust and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be checked legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ur@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all the questions in peace if they are judi@@ ci@@ ally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ur@@ l called T@@ v@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a little curious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ it@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she described himself as a pendant of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called on the back@@ sliding MEPs to return their country parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we naturally assume that , with immediate effect , she has returned her country mandate , which she received from the Green State List , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group leader An@@ ja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has deliberately decided not to wage any pron@@ unciation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background that there were no substan@@ tive differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on to Lower Saxony &apos;s Green Party members .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only a betra@@ yal of the voters but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Parliament .

interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ sies , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal be ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) address and answer .
Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from contaminated eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information about the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to everything we currently know , a health hazard is practically excluded .
is Al@@ di now taking over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless my house has turned up without delay and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s dis@@ may .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
as the manufacturers are concerned , trade has to ensure that the products sold are able to transport and are harmless to health .
if the residual calcium content of eggs exceeds 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are non @-@ transfer@@ able .
un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time , not the farms are to blame .
are manufacturing plants and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to the state of knowledge , the production plants do not meet any im@@ min@@ ent fault .
rather , they must expect economic damages due to the suspected illegal practices of service companies .
as always , in the case of a serious incident , there are too few controllers .
is it missing only at the staff or in the conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was just the official controls that revealed the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 per cent .
it is precisely for this reason that a consistent clari@@ fication of such events and the transfer to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can be present are of decisive importance .
I have already made several distinc@@ tions that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment by the responsible authorities .
is peri@@ odic alar@@ mis@@ m in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly swe@@ aring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by pan@@ elling funds , manufacturers , retailers and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide &apos;s fi@@ pron@@ il in the position of food delivering animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
this must be consistent and high @-@ pressure on all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all relevant authorities that the facts are quickly and completely enligh@@ tened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the Financial Reg@@ ulations of Football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mo@@ ving to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imped@@ ed issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come true for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from UEF@@ A , as the management organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A means PS@@ G has to prove at some point that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s transfer has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy Brazi@@ li@@ ans from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make money loose for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him into a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the power @-@ rich royal family of Qatar .
clubs must pay a lot of money for the purchase of players , but have to counter@@ act with legitimate income sources , which allow them the break @-@ even point in their activities related to football .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
former French player believed that clubs , which had taken enormous debt in their quest for success , effectively dec@@ eive and ris@@ ked to ruin when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentr@@ ating on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , which Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P assessment period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amounting to EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen in favour of the Pres@@ idency in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor A@@ lek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to dis@@ courage excessive spending .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely increase the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , responsible for the UEF@@ A UEF@@ A , compared with The Associated Press in the past week .
although PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the selling price for the next five years can be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions .
PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later fell to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to outs@@ m@@ art their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Q@@ at@@ ari company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be considered a legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA &apos;s sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 fought against N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup ambass@@ adors to be and could easily find out such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to ignore any attempt to b@@ ypass the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associated Press since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and jer@@ sey sales .
the association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of the La league , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ar@@ senal manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finan@@ ces an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because one can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate has made board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation is coming to an end : the airline is re@@ writing the order .
at the request of the news agency Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott , Swiss spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott established a corresponding report of the newspaper Nord@@ west@@ schweiz on Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
around 17 million small red and white protected Scho@@ gg@@ it@@ ues per year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants in front of landing to the passengers .
Swiss did not want to make any statements about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the order volume according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary generated annual sales of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer .
the Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y tries to expand the contract beyond the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a comment .
Swiss has been distributing chocolate bars on board their flights since 2006 .
Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g before the Swiss concluded a contract with the daughter of Mig@@ ros .
Swiss had the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long haul flights the First Class customers will be spo@@ ilt by the Spr@@ ün@@ gli &apos;s confection@@ ery , in Business Class passengers Sho@@ gg@@ i von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i distri@@ butes Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in Business and Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is also nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &quot; s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( when the thin@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to larger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a talking box of vegetables that was spoken by H. J@@ on Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by stiff@@ ening themselves at the core of the g@@ ag - middle @-@ aged actors play cool children , who will grow up - but they still managed to regain the last part of the weather .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who are now playing adults , is less emo@@ tionally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes beyond the watering can principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 @-@ he years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character rum@@ mage through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( K@@ en Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another crazy evil plot in which Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good example of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it is particularly fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons under the lip of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy now feels like an old cra@@ cker .
it &apos;s the moments of accidental ma@@ dness that could fuel this fran@@ chise just like a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches that which I suppose as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the band premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
in the meantime , &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon reminds us of another kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West @-@ West @-@ Ring @-@ I@@ con@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka is to be a bound TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two Buchar@@ est officers , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the road of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Greg@@ or and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues are synchron@@ ised by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an extensive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice flags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent match &apos; Fin@@ ds the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - often as one plays .
in six long episodes , it moves away , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was edited on a lower length , could better deliver its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Greg@@ ory and I@@ os@@ ef continue to visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything for food for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creator were not wrong : we even do it with our own recent history and with theirs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in crus@@ hing the Italian Ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart .
15 accused were arrested between 25 and 77 years of age and had already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials established larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros .
during the same ra@@ ids in Italy two persons were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the suspect Itali@@ ans .
the two are therefore probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators took part in the action .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organised drug crime , violent acts of violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organised drug trade in southern Germany .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil were in close contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the Grand deployment was also accompanied by four civil servants from Palermo .
the investigations were aimed primarily at Italian citizens with close ties to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on 27th May in Hü@@ fingen , at which several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the bank account .
sage lam@@ ents large gaps in the foreign register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not show up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreign register in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to partly serious mistakes in the case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for the Refu@@ ge@@ e Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the immigration center register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partially serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , warned in an analysis carried out by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the data , ten million people are registered with foreign citizenship , including some 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU states .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
because the data had not been properly maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register anymore . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faulty data entries can slow revers@@ al processes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the report further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the statistics on sufficient people , EU citizens are also included who don &apos;t have to travel at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such mis@@ concep@@ tions led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distorted debate on how to deal with exp@@ atri@@ ates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is therefore stated in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with under 16 @-@ year @-@ olds when they have entered the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this comes from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper , it is therefore said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF carries out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children , with the exception of infants and small children - after Italy since 1st June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper referred to the difficult situation on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU state , which they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant continues to travel to another EU country , the state can send it back into the country of entry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ministry now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy gave guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) considers these commitments enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children thre@@ aten un@@ lawful reception conditions and a threat to child welfare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach provided blood don@@ or service to other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now shares 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , at the meeting of the Municipal Council , the congregation acknowled@@ ges the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is designed for this and we respect the don@@ ors that make their blood available to strangers , even more un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner .
&quot; a single donation of blood helps several people , &quot; explained the District Church leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ zur@@ bacher , for the preserved foods are broken down into their components .
three people could already benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , he reported about the actions carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K round@@ about . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the switch to the theatre department has led to higher attendance figures a few years ago .
even before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations .
half as many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ oth@@ ee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ edel@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ gel@@ ow , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter handed down 500 milli@@ litres of their life juice ten times each time .
Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation on a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it kept interest rates on family income in the midst of intensified pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers voted with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members staying in this month , as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly infl@@ ation@@ ary report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall .
but it sign@@ alled that interest increases would be necessary in the next few years to raise the inflation raised by Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the mamm@@ oth stimulus package published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks as of the coming February , although it is expected that it will now provide 15 billion pounds in the framework of this system - with CHF 115 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate the bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the interest rates , they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank emphas@@ ised that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the downward corrected growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % in comparison with the forecast forecast in May .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell according to these news to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations on a rise in interest and GDP in the second quarter rose from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to fall at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will slightly recover after the Bank towards the end of the year .
the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases , as the tigh@@ tening will become even worse before it will improve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound , which will offset some of the lower consumption expenditure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the shock@@ ing EU vote which caused the fall &apos;s decline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final judgement on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed budgets , with three policy makers in July demanding an increase to 0.5 % .
the inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will be attracting them again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the excess in relation to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers said : &quot; in view of the recent down@@ turn in swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals exp@@ ire and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to drive controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September following a fight in front of the High Court on the funding of the drug in the N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by the health service via a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the App@@ eals Court confirmed in the last year a ruling by the Supreme Court that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance it .
the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National A@@ ids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as the &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in UK in April 2018 .
pre@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infection .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
people who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in hospitals , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also opt @-@ in for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be signed by £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , how it is used , implemented and implemented on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this big new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of mankind &apos;s biggest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National A@@ ids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if targeted towards needy and endangered people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to negotiations with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now must be that the study is quickly carried out across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 infected people infected with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Shadow Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how trans@@ form@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people infected with HIV and that it will help us to step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this small Ear@@ ls Court flat into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced himself from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is evidence of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sell her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot flat has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne closet space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed von Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to resolve the issue .
&quot; the steel work is rather complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to arrange the spaces in such a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine floor , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over@@ looks the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance we offer mirr@@ ored units space for all cutlery and j@@ ars made by Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering art went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is mutual important , so it is very easy to slide the door when you move the door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne gains additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the size of the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they succeeded in enlar@@ ging the floor space and at the same time using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious benefit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and which help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love the electrical sockets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that a flat can be transformed by a good design and an increased square footage of something by default in something very astonishing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you might decide not to leave this .
brothers Stru@@ ggle for a $ 500 Million in Real Estate Imperi@@ um
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a dispute due to one of the largest real estate agents of Victori@@ as worth more than $ 500 million .
the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and Develop@@ er Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co family founded je@@ ans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold to US $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city center , the areas of development of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in was described by Paul as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a legal file states that this means that Col@@ in owns property worth 316 million dollars and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem point for Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him behind what I kept for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed attempts , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now also struggle to control the existing business - Col@@ in , as Paul claims , excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but accused Paul of managing some possessions in@@ compet@@ ently .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it that was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage states that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs increase in the case , with hundreds of sites with affir@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and law firms held by both parties .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early 1970s .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans shop of the family .
Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons .
&quot; Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , where Col@@ in claims that Mark was paid $ 10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in was very shy , although he was a former AF@@ L member of the board and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in responded by sm@@ s to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is in front of the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote .
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current conflict , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our issue will be solved by courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media &apos;s abst@@ in@@ ence from the President .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kel@@ ly can do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including reports from the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kel@@ ly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executive employees on his first day of work , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he wanted to fix : poor information that has fallen into the hands of the president .
Kel@@ ly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television commerci@@ als are still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed for unfair reporting it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter custom under control , according to six former election campaign officials , insi@@ sts that his personal media consumption involves a constant praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
maybe these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets would have contained even more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his collabor@@ ators managed to keep him out of trouble for a few times , their efforts paid off .
but no one has been able to consistently prevent Tr@@ ump contro@@ versy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , will always try to present their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views of the world .
Poli@@ tico - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ers to give the president question@@ able information for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano on negative press cuts , especially those with humili@@ ating le@@ aks , and that he insi@@ sts on finding out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone gave the president a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a bunch of leak &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter due to ch@@ ic@@ anes or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and began asking people about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gold makers added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the General Secretary of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work that Tr@@ ump receives . &quot;
how did that work out ?
Kel@@ ly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the assistance of the population is asked and hoped for .
the police in all of Europe sends ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after sever@@ ity criminals are naturally not known , information from the population is hoped and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol announced on Friday the action following the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adv@@ ent calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences would have shown that many volati@@ le volati@@ le destinations are hiding , called Euro@@ pol .
I have put together 21 post@@ cards for criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ aining , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed .
36 of the online requests could be captured so far , at least eleven of them due to clu@@ es after the publication on the website .
travellers negotiate a tren@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owners of the West Mid@@ lands stand again with some resol@@ ute travellers on the war@@ foot , who have tra@@ ded a tren@@ ch drawn by the commun@@ e to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a wealthy street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their attacks .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed its vehicles through a section un@@ imped@@ ed to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ra@@ ging inhabitants have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous vill@@ ager said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were forwarded by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council must indeed be forced by shame to implement it , as it was useless when dealing with the problem .
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .
more of them arrived last night , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long brief@@ ings to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I live on stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local charge if the Council does not even stop it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local resident , who did not want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokesperson for Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised repository on the country beyond the stre@@ ets@@ brook road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as quickly as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour to the police by invo@@ king 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof forest hotel Lu@@ ise
the Lu@@ ise Forest Hotel is located in the former Hotel Birken@@ hof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is being renovated and is to be opened again on the 1st of March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Birken@@ hof by the then Ambiente company lt@@ d. to 13 April 2014 , approximately 30,000 nights per year were lost and income from the city tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered to the District Council as a collective shelter , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Lord Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke at that time by serious interested parties in the house .
he should be right .
the group of Lu@@ isen@@ yi with Managing Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt property .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ haus@@ er .
they are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , building sh@@ utt@@ ings are already standing in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear how extensive renov@@ ations are carried out .
the floors have been torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to be done until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness centre and meeting room belong to the facilities .
you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale inner city level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes .
the Lu@@ ise forest hotel with about 60 rooms wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already led talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define exactly .
just under a million euros , he calcul@@ ates .
the external systems are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : U.S. Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special promot@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have set up a so @-@ called Grand Jury upon a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the committee has recorded the work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote on appeal to persons familiar with the cause . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper presented the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded and intensified his investigations .
the broad@@ ca@@ ster CN@@ N reported that there are already initial charges in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to have pur@@ pos@@ efully interven@@ ed in the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign team and Moscow .
the investigations will focus on several men acting as advis@@ ers to the Republi@@ cans during the election campaign .
according to reports Mu@@ eller took a close look at more and more Tr@@ um@@ ps for private and business environments .
a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote several weeks ago that the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator Tr@@ ump moved personally to the centre and under@@ took the accus@@ ation whether the President could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the wake of the affair .
the main task of Grand J@@ uries is to examine the present evidence in possible criminal cases and decide if prosecution is to be charged .
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also called anchor clips .
they are usually turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases .
the procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in order to invite individuals to the company under oath .
according to the CN@@ N , invitations were already issued , which revol@@ ved around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement , they stated in the report .
they should also provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ um@@ ps advis@@ ers and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner as well as his female election campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were involved in the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the translation show that Mu@@ eller does not let himself be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly .
but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be involved in the end to decide on the collection of an indictment .
nevertheless , the setting up of the committee is the start of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme gives the democr@@ ats an opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the sub@@ stitution of a Grand Jury .
but this usually works in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates all measures that accelerated the work of the Special Or@@ ders in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FB@@ I chief James Com@@ ey has said three times that it is not against the President .
I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was stated in the Declaration .
Mu@@ eller was first used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this re@@ vocation , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have become loud , he have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
comm@@ enting on a Senate Committee in June , Com@@ ey asked him to set up investigations against the former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after displaying US media , the White House collected material against the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator and its employees .
this triggered spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller was to be released .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair about the later rec@@ eded President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the beh@@ est of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented bills on Thursday , after which the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator could no longer be released so easily .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the west Antar@@ c@@ tica a giant ic@@ e@@ berg from the narrow@@ ly seven @-@ times size of Berlin was solved .
this was shared by the Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus swe@@ eping over a tri@@ l@@ lion ton and 5@@ 800 square kilometers is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it mel@@ ts .
with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
it is not a threat to human beings .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demoli@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear according to research data .
however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s of ice cream cones in the region for around 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fest .
Sch@@ el@@ fest flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow further into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fest is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e was disturbed by the balance of wa@@ xes and break@@ age a few years ago .
a complete interview can be found there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say , that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fest is in danger , because the front edge has never been as far back as at present .
in addition , the iron plate stands under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key point .
melting of Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ l and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level , as they float on the water and ice as much water as it yields after melting .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could potentially increase sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fest is the fourth @-@ largest ice shelf in Antar@@ c@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters .
there it breaks off regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he affir@@ med . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists were argu@@ ing whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fest will grow back or go back in the long term and possibly fall together , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though these researchers do not rel@@ inqu@@ ish the ab@@ rupt of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many of the Antar@@ ctic ice r@@ ins@@ ets have fallen apart during the last decades .
this long skirt of the Antar@@ ctic stretches towards South America .
according to the research programme of the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the Antar@@ ctic Survey &apos;s ice surface has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees in the last 50 years and thus en@@ umer@@ ates the areas in which the temperature is the fastest rising .
CD@@ U wants to work at the front of the house
because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ an@@ cies , the CD@@ U asks to step out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
only a short time before the summer break , 41 new jobs were tra@@ ged in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have completed their first day of work .
the teaching positions in the circle are obviously very sought after .
approximately 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places to be awarded this year .
nevertheless , the group still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently there are 50 un@@ occupied places in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
we are looking for doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and meet the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration is to develop a concept for human resources and personnel development according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; desire of the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to meet short @-@ term demand for skilled workers but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented applications of applicants .
the overall concept should be oriented in@@ wards and out@@ war@@ dly , showing concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and include a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you did not know before .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speech is of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real competition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this results in a large number of employees who leave the service for illness or age .
high time for action , so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , the leader of the CD@@ U , will go beyond the joint request with his party .
he had long been worried about a la@@ zy surprise when he questioned the st@@ aff@@ ing of personnel and start@@ led the other parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peoples want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow a discharge from the communal employers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are not able to achieve a satisfactory solution in the short term , the circle administration with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should strive for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; races . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ff for public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently prescribed exactly , increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level that is oriented towards career years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law .
last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , coun@@ cils Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone on NGO migrants &apos; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis War@@ ning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ ained &apos; because their crew had worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to express itself to detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations currently collected after we have gathered all the information and judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ ained &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is thought that its crew will take din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which will be delivered directly by traffi@@ ckers and that s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can take off so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was claimed only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s Act , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of putting away the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must , above all , have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have previously agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization is Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
in the meantime , Minn@@ i said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who have left these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berliner Ou@@ ter Post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the northern Pal@@ at@@ inate , to enjoy Tri@@ als and attractions for four days .
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal was a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour conducted at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , some on towers , from which one could look far above the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were again and again longer climb@@ s , for the long Tri@@ als rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again , there was a look@@ out point to the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wer@@ ed &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days a lot of altitude metres were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and lod@@ ges brought welcome breaks .
the bi@@ kers in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim inhal@@ e cur@@ ative br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ li@@ ga equi@@ ps itself for E @-@ sport
do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future instead of being forced to fight through the stadium speed in the event of wind and weather ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels included .
they also recognized the first Bundes@@ li@@ ga@@ ver@@ eine , who are increasingly involved in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two pro@@ s for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain that many clubs are still rising on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main , or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , for example , have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football , in particular , must deal with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that young people will also go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be present online by far more often on these markets than to send the Bundes@@ li@@ gam@@ ann@@ ie to Asia once a year .
what is it all about ?
in the E @-@ sport , computer games such as League Of Legends , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA World Cup simulation will focus on competition level .
as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long since established themselves , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in the 2022 World Cup , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it a proper sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ oso has also been dealing with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sport - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also requires cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction capacity .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only at the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the F@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls were difficult to carry out in online games , and the structures of classic sports were missing in the scene .
the scientists emphas@@ ise the high integr@@ ative impact of e @-@ sports .
the players are on the move internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association for Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sports .
in 2016 , 50 million euros were implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ship and large tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to lie at 130 million .
this is little against the nearly 2.4 billion euro of the Bundes@@ li@@ ga football league .
however , e @-@ sport is not far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants .
many countries are already international .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports competition provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is also a lot happening in Europe .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a lesson , &quot; said F@@ rob@@ bed .
according to D@@ utt , football associations in the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an E @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is lag@@ ging behind in European comparison , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains R@@ ött@@ ger &apos;s V@@ f@@ B board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to fall in nostal@@ gia and to clarify the old times is not enough today .
the aim is to preserve the society &apos;s tradition , but at the same time align the company with the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ sed world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t hold on to the fact that only football everything remains as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the texts that Con@@ rad Roy urged to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide .
Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend fifteen months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years were suspended for prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June of Con@@ rad Roy &apos;s negli@@ gent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his vocation .
she had been faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in his eyes , folded hands and down@@ wards , when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she ended his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she took no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she showed no repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance which she completely regre@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge La@@ wr@@ ence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find that her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even her mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no day when I do not smoke the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for eternity despite all my sor@@ rows that we will carry with us for eternity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the realization that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or would be an aun@@ t for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer have this single person with whom I have been together since my birth , is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to call upon another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , hop on a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit by any press of the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Car@@ ter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x was a member of Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced to her British co @-@ room@@ mate in Italy in 2007 before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learn from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ me was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as a ski@@ pper is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern won the Con@@ fed Cup winner a big season - Extra motivation does not harm .
something else was different on his seat in the cabin , which Joshua Situ@@ ated instantly , even though the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er could be seen , he made himself the split bond to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach didn &apos;t announce it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as a Bayern captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the stand could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but I could interpret the sign from the coach as well .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f , who was born out of young@@ sters , de@@ but@@ s and especially from the holiday , but he .
sugar is usually distributed to those with a lot of confidence , which you want to keep in a good mood .
so those who were chosen to approach the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ mich confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old p@@ enn@@ ed over the field as a mini @-@ lam@@ eness .
right rear , this is now its position , the white bond on the arm did the rest .
and at all Kim@@ me appeared in this initial formation as the one who can also take the helm best into the hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ played tro@@ upe .
he had a look at the whole while many others were busy with themselves .
Vi@@ dal therefore decided to re@@ play his missing fitness ( hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ chs ris@@ ked to come out to the performances of the Asia @-@ trip ( also only condi@@ tionally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus did not fall neg@@ atively in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot .
after all , it worked fine .
Sü@@ le ran along with Kim@@ olos , Ru@@ dy in front of the def@@ ences , both acted confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm often proved difficult , and in addition , Sü@@ le tried a few times in the build @-@ up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the outcome was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we hoped it would be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance during the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also taken for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as unusual this Bayern @-@ Welt is still for the new additions , one saw in the connection to the game .
Ru@@ dy for example gave not one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ mich bid f@@ arewell after a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you just have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one more .

it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economics of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected more than a year in which the new economic minister Volker Wis@@ ser ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region talk about a change in economic policy on T V - and simultaneously t@@ oss the old minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ ser takes up the desires of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
Nat@@ us sees the biggest revers@@ al in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priorities list .
this year , the Ministry hopes to establish a planning process until 2021 is expected to be the construction law .
a role in the plans of the country is also played by the western circum@@ vention of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Office of Transport .
the target is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says Ministeri@@ al Cor@@ respon@@ dent Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees a sign in it to support regional but international competing companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier is striving to promote a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label with the wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German exports that have been sag@@ ging for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ ser has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , the Chamber of Commerce pra@@ ises .
in the new master bonus , the Chamber of Crafts Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the passed master exam and 2500 euros if graduates make their own self @-@ employed within ten years of their master &apos;s education .
the home@@ work list for the country stays long .
the planned road@@ works quickly reveal facts , but at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , CEO of the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) .
only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers , who want to hire the Wis@@ ser for the national mobility .
the Chamber of Industry calls for more orders to be assigned to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , CD@@ U , refers to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros in 2017 and is less than suggested in the receipt of country roads .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects the country &apos;s concept of how to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the former broad@@ band extension in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies had only rated the grid supply in an I@@ HK survey with a score of 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about stagn@@ ating internet connections and out@@ breaks .
former Minister for Economic Affairs E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where she already cleared the field after four months of dis@@ agreements .
Audi to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW announced that it would offer to update the software in over 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said the BMW Group that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than travel restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he was referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with regulations for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are regarded as carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of car manufacturers to install systems for neutr@@ alization of exhaust gases em@@ itted by diesel vehicles also increases what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of pl@@ ou@@ ting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies attempt to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called amor@@ tis@@ ation equipment , which could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities acc@@ use Audi to have installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States has been expanded .
Volkswagen &apos;s involvement in the investigation would be hard to put on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes proportion@@ ately to the win of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft travels to Munich on Saturday morning , which has a special message .
if on Saturday the Is@@ ar goes back to the Is@@ ar , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ Bridge .
and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building department wants to clarify .
on the raft you can see a large inf@@ otainment system .
it shows a waste mountain .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; is meant to shar@@ pen the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a protected game flow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft drove over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behaviour .
Mor@@ dil@@ los boy @-@ n@@ oses and laughter against sorrow
Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was sometimes one of the most widely published carto@@ on@@ ists , the n@@ oses of his characters are his trademarks .
also with 85 , the Argent@@ inian is still painting and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laugh , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he hit himself as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greeting cards - which fru@@ strates him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said once . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the Six@@ ties : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish morph@@ ing characters cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he is still alive today , working almost ten hours a day .
about cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ us@@ cu@@ ffs and watches , his dro@@ ll figures continue to spread widely throughout the world .
he has been working on a cartoon @-@ film and a TV @-@ series with his figures for six years .
the main person in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s most popular animal in his drawings - who has a jack of thousands as a counter@@ point .
for the first time , his figures in the 3D film , 2019 , will be addressed to the cinema screen .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they &apos;re saying , it &apos;s wei@@ rd for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o .
the script is not written by him .
that &apos;s why he tends to focus on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without words .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence is threatened by climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is due to the conditions reminiscent of drought and insects @-@ borne insects , which causes scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , prepare big head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agr@@ arian research institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is highly endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which in spring has brought much less rain and much more in the fall .
this has effects on the service life of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small ci@@ ch@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium , that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have fewer parts with e@@ there@@ al oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slow@@ ing evap@@ oration from soil , but also spra@@ ying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resili@@ ent to drought .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ in@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 year anniversary this year .
the highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .
shop@@ keepers , guil@@ ds , merchants , vag@@ ab@@ onds or a land camp are to be seen in the city centre these days .
the assass@@ ination of a journalist emphas@@ ises the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they told them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists will discuss what is more secure : they should take their children into the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a tablet at the front of the room : enemies , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed , percep@@ tions and stomach feelings are enough .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists suspected to stand on the government &apos;s pay@@ roll or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest period of violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses accum@@ ulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . after attacks and threats under federal law and so far , there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter are her editors and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , who show his smiling face with glasses or his typical pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after its death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Special Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only launched two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as in most of the thousands of kill@@ ings , which are associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely tried in court .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is now even more pu@@ zz@@ ling .
without information about the kill@@ ers , without justice , the meeting has little benefit to the discussion of security , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we mi@@ str@@ ust everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth River . &quot;
the sho@@ oter stopped in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but there is practically nothing to silence about Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos; arrest in the United States last year and the ex@@ tradition in the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country , as rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ stor@@ eyed m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
at first there was in February the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected ga@@ it members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to not force Val@@ dez to leave the country for its own security following the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars of shar@@ ehol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without b@@ umping into the intoxic@@ ant problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ y@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper has earned a reputation for cour@@ a@@ geous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising declined .
repor@@ ters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his Cour@@ age in the Per@@ sec@@ ution of Mexican Drug History , wherever she was leading .
he gave himself up willingly that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to keep alive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team miss Val@@ dez , the fun bird that could cur@@ b like a dock worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was His love to the routine be cal@@ am@@ ity ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own ass@@ umptions about how they can best do their work and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their women , their children , their clean businesses , their secret start @-@ ups and run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ y@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
the anger is , &quot; said the publisher of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the matter with J@@ avier is happening . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as not in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for security training , no mobile phones suddenly were allowed . days before it became known that sp@@ y@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a middle @-@ class neighborhood of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked themselves if these officers were among the 50 per cent of the police officers who the Gover@@ nor described as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the repor@@ ters went to the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former known bo@@ xer Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had a expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures concentrated on the Gover@@ nor &apos;s hom@@ etown .
and there was a group that conducted a kidn@@ apping in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was given when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled all the political levels almost the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were charged with high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months earlier , readers told Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the best informed source about kidn@@ apping .
&quot; in the past we had known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , nick@@ named &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body .
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez caught a few notes and went the next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials said , based on DNA testing that it is his .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalists have become lou@@ der throughout the country , writing in organized protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez publicly accused the authorities of sp@@ ying on journalists and killing them because they told the truth .
she has since asked for her to be re@@ group@@ ed by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated its objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists were &quot; surrounded &quot; in Mexico by organised crime , government officials and an in@@ different society .
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were infected with organised crime under a ceiling .
last year , the &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; media group was assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of B@@ log@@ ist Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note supposedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones lie beside her separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana did from Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the murder of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly focused on the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page titled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben E@@ spin@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking sc@@ ares him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico is going to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer when suddenly all their phones began to bu@@ zz .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with riv@@ eting riv@@ als and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a number of cart@@ el em@@ bas@@ sies in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on mobile phones .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ ul@@ ed nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept guard to see if they were in readiness .
if they were frigh@@ tened at all , they did not show it .
under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about closing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ y@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her for reporting on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used clo@@ aking to ev@@ ade his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening one .
researchers have now found out that the first findings of the unbelievable r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros of a Canadian mountain worker have been preserved so well that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said that she had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reserved din@@ osau@@ r that has ever been found and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ preserved state has start@@ led researchers who describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil in its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Radio when he was on March 21 , 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something out of the surrounding rock out of place , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) severe earth@@ en@@ ware .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you b@@ link only a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strongly arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique , which is known as mat@@ ing , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to better blend into its surroundings and avoid its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by large din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ our over his body .
they discovered the sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side .
although the sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today .
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ r was driven by enough pressure by eating car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong beast behaviour on a massive , heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r shows how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es must have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to examine the animal on clu@@ es about his life , including his con@@ served gut content to find out what he ate as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as south @-@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much far@@ ther inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but also retained in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much fantasy to re@@ construct it . if you only gam@@ ble a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs , crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six ton heavy monster .
the scientists whose latest findings are published in the Current Biology trade journal believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and mut@@ ated in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn funk , when he dug in the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the sub@@ du@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous was swe@@ pt through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the sub@@ mer@@ ging of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the remains of this special specimen are preserved in such a way that the front door still cover b@@ ump@@ y shell plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a lot@@ tery win .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied wood remains still cover the b@@ ump@@ y shell plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foot is lying on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can count the scales on its sole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many wounded
serious accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass ar@@ mor@@ ed bolt .
there are numerous wounded , kilomet@@ re @-@ long st@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ mor@@ ed on the late Thursday afternoon .
according to the police , around 5 p.m. between the junction stations Adel@@ boden and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm close to 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , crashed into each other .
at first there was no information on the exact number of injuries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a light to moderate @-@ weight hur@@ ts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large order of rescue vehicles was at the site of the accident .
the A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of driving Munich , a ten @-@ kilomet@@ re long back@@ log was formed .
as an A@@ Z repor@@ ter reports , there was also a massive han@@ di@@ cap on the counter @-@ race track - through numerous G@@ aff@@ ers .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade is the hall@@ mark of the vehicle &apos;s drivers , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tested &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : you &apos;re sitting in the train and sleeping .
or you are immersed in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ered .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes an unpleasant or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the job @-@ free ticket control .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that one takes its place and thus vali@@ dates the ticket .
currently , a test operation is running on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer comes , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in many other long distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train the de@@ valuation of tickets without conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use this , however , some requirements have to be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers anyway .
you must also have bought it via the App of the train , the DB navig@@ ator , which is anyway the most convenient way of ticket booking .
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like that : one goes to the train , calls his ticket to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for the electronic evaluation will then appear in the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a notification on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and the booked seat Y is occupied .
if the train atten@@ dant arrives at the ticket inspection at Place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , keep on working , keep silent .
check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn is to use the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train crew check in the DB navig@@ ator themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &apos;s marketing management board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who travel often know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are one of the biggest off@@ ences .
because of@@ ten@@ times , in any case , one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents needed for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or identity card or otherwise a document you have to show .
the result is endless discussion between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in the control of one &apos;s own ticket and takes the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that applies only to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen connections .
further train numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to its core .
just one day after she arrived in New York City , she was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled by Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , since nobody else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the handle @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly res@@ cu@@ ed at their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ ets the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put off her mobile phone to return later in the evening to twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police tape and people shou@@ ting , and from a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who bore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman secured his ri@@ f@@ le and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we are used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11@@ pm she took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cin@@ emas from 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who wore a flower @-@ dress and a matching crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take her with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves .
even though I &apos;m lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally experienced no bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be doing her a bad service to keep her away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police department , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter combined with a local business owner who had lunch .
they prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has totally changed after August 9 , &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has all come . &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one question came Fer@@ rel@@ l in the sense : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of white people - in a community who prof@@ ited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Tor@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt pris@@ ons .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years following Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we talk , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me as these people are portra@@ yed , for so I shall be portra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ is &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells &apos;s life , as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ferr@@ ells also repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Li@@ ves movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after the murder of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we are constantly struggling on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ sed type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no accident , although it was at the forefront , because in a life on these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the racial ties between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
yet she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels bound to this memory since she went on the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we have to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV @-@ readers talk about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though it hasn &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian area has since the first presentation of 2009 split the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents .
the theme is hardly cold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the one to the bit gallery says : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; This would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents ins@@ ist that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , including the rest of the shops , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will ble@@ ed out .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct markets offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work will be finished .
the Gallery cre@@ ators want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a Square with possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Zimmer : &quot; we have been shopping for many years almost every week in the farmers market hall .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm ladies always liked very much .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like that even during and above all , after the construction of the gallery , there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities this is also possible .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery , depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should probably not be very low for the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is the right place for shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , footwear , dru@@ g@@ store or supermarkets : I think this is superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough of it in our city .
you can see how many stores here are empty - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is also reasonably priced .
as you can see , stores in a shopping centre are rented only by larger companies , because the r@@ ents there are often not tra@@ dable for a retail@@ er .
it &apos;s a pity that there are no special shops anymore and what is left of it will disappear . &quot;
wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a market hall does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market hall go towards during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the spec@@ ter bit gallery already manage to sell all business from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
and there is no need for a shopping center that is empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real peasant market , rather than this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall there is no place thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room at the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , there are many faces to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 Portra@@ its were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ etz , which were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year sentence after being secretly post@@ ulated diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspon@@ den@@ ces between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ woman and a ground@@ breaking dissi@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his ministry .
through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which was extracted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg took a sharp as well as some intellectual comment not only on the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways that they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison , her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing visi@@ bly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with whom she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the big success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a portrait of a DNA .
the artist and her imprisoned bl@@ ouse have become un@@ equal to those who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; comic book by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the President would transform the judgment , and she would be able to see the exhibition in person .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years would call for a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy coincidence .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tr@@ ump puts a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new twe@@ et@@ able ways to keep the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a reason . &quot;
in an artistic statement written on the gallery of the gallery Mann@@ ing demanded with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name is marked with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , &quot; whose basis gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , in pencil .
we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , how aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological sense , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic novel .
it shows Mann@@ ing how she emerges from the discipline of the United States like King Kong with a hands @-@ on phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they make your speech cold , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keep your mouth shut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came straight from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets out of Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition in person - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , by her own gen@@ om@@ ical simul@@ ac@@ r@@ ors that gather like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing stat@@ ure ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea like the movement that was hiding behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University because of murder sought
a nationwide human hunt is under way for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University who were sought susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed in a luxury apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday , arrest warran@@ ts were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) for their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the District Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stab@@ s .
a common warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene of the event , and det@@ ec@@ tives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder while the police are actively looking for the susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 , La@@ has has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at the Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ oud , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explaining that La@@ is is now being evaluated and excluded from entering the Campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case investigated by the relevant authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the University and of Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail explaining that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the UK police and are ready to help US investig@@ ative agencies in any way possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urged the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate it strengthen themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip who said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
police described the scene as being very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that trucks and war@@ locks were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team at Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will complete the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Vice @-@ President Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Vice Premier Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t have anything to concern for Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria listed in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren for publicly funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission .
in conversation with the Russian outlet r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v faced problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 as a result of the Dop@@ ing sc@@ andal by the WA@@ DA by the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
following a visit to Moscow &apos;s headquarters in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

from now on , only eggs are likely to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been demon@@ stra@@ bly tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ legitimate anti @-@ L@@ ing@@ em@@ itt@@ el .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to compete at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up with your employees , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not believe the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply no consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Association Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called people from the outside for help .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ up Race is the best way to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , provide staff anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to circum@@ vent the C @-@ suite managers and to turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said she has gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys from specific teams , it provides a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can drill down why .
companies come to see that they need to remain at the forefront of workplace culture so that you will not be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this desire for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 after the Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments website .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
he recently signed up as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ gence lets companies send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , gather confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
and if the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company finds its employees badly treated or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , &quot; said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , has deployed Con@@ ver@@ sible for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their headquarters .
in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel who said there was no good way to track the discomfort of employees .
now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ sible , problems that previously were hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed more quickly , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair internship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who manages the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies started to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen crashed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that businesses realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry going online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ gence offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will support Venture Capital investors who have supported both startups .
in February , Con@@ ver@@ gence received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ it@@ tering guaranteed $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only st@@ akes .
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ sible and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ tes when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
when the third @-@ party analytics tools promise to raise commitment and commitment to employees , it &apos;s no wonder that you will find support .
the data about employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , it can grow dis@@ appointments and demo@@ tiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because if you don &apos;t follow workers ask yourself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care why , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , says Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after receiving feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company has always gained new insights into the workforce and hopes that in the long run , this will lead to a better bond of workers in a sector that is known for a high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you lose customers too .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Brotherhood
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA footprint players conver@@ se on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot pieces and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these un@@ active minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled in the Summer Courses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Aqu@@ arian Football Center next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday was Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and they actually extended their days - at least to the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already fully packed schedules of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ins moved the beginning of the camp almost one week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood performing practical exercises .
20 minutes before the beginning of the formal preparations for the kick @-@ off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s change of rules even if they add another point to the busy schedules of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed it through , they pl@@ ough further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already been thrown off with foot@@ balls , which is a protective net behind a door@@ post , will be no easy task .
brother players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then decide to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape of one exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good business .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces in parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that is why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ check in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and then show their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect potential counter@@ f@@ eit detection and to send them to factor reviewed which may display results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan to get rid of hate @-@ filled posts as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook told in a separate statement in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts review was started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories are addressed by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the &quot; related article &quot; and works on other changes in his news feed to reduce false messages .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cos@@ mop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ dil@@ ection for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the signature of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says humor@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; in 2014 , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; I have only responded to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his term of thumb ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell to smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; ) this all seems too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , browsing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscape gar@@ den@@ ers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent what possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch in which two families fought .
guys , let &apos;s go all his gear ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se themselves in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising started in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons who hid the family Dar@@ rel@@ l for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l was portra@@ yed in the 18th century by stu@@ ffed his own funeral by stu@@ ffed a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery which was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug out ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite a go@@ aun@@ er , always debt and spending money for things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;

he spent a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which since then has been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I must get back with the dam@@ n life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Camp@@ a@@ ign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle en@@ wrapped in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the commitment of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , Bad Honne@@ f launched her campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
even until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team around Nelson Ar@@ tz will keep the logo and slogan &quot; secret . &quot;
at the end of August there will be a celebration on the island Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking since yesterday on the posters at the chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think that ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote on her website which was released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that many things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically we are convinced that as Bad Honne@@ f citizens we know very well about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the action , it is about more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she stands in competition with other communities .
an average five @-@ digit amount can be seen in Bad Honne@@ f &apos;s new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on pen@@ sion@@ ings and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so this week too .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the pres@@ idency of the Prime Minister .
the five vice @-@ pres@@ idents and ministers for defence , home affairs , justice and foreign affairs also participated in the deliber@@ ations under the chair@@ manship of the Prime Minister .
in this way , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the over@@ count .
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the Army , the Air Force and the Navy have been dismissed .
since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan 169 has fired 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile @-@ pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as the clin@@ cher of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who allegedly participated in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the coup attempt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God &apos;s Gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clean up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
at the end of February , the &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; newspaper published an article with the heading &quot; Dis@@ comfort in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff there are concerns about increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the aboli@@ tion of the clo@@ g ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any case , the grand@@ stand in the army and the security forces goes on .
in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan ordered another 7@@ 3@@ 95 ser@@ ge@@ ants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed up the military .
the gener@@ als used to go earlier than the real masters of the country .
three times they filed their role as guar@@ dians of the secular order of state .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan ki@@ cked off the military &apos;s power step by step , not least with reference to the reform specifications of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan prov@@ okes targeted Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a named officer , who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the coup attempt , warned that the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
in any case , there is doubt in the alliance after pur@@ ging doubts about the readiness for action of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational skills are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington modi@@ fies the Green Card rules
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
he fores@@ ees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions for family @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries will spend green cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate circuit for road platform shuttle
over and over the past few months we have been argu@@ ing about the future of the racing shuttle - now it &apos;s going to be quite fast .
even before the end of the year , on the ailing trail , on which the tourist train de@@ parts , is to be built .
in order to secure the future of the circuit break@@ age in the long term , construction works are expected to commen@@ ce this year , according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; with the decision to further order and rehabil@@ itate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this important connection , especially for tourism , &quot; declared Minister of Transport Klaus Kin@@ sey on Friday in Er@@ furt .
the costs for the repair of the route amounted to about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country exceeds 75 percent .
the agreement , on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , is currently fin@@ alised , explained at@@ oning .
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ in@@ gian rail as operators are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proposed agreement between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of 11 years .
this means that the racing bike shuttle should be ordered regular on December 2017 .
the track shuttle is a popular rail link between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
in the course of a pilot operation , in the past few months , it has been tested whether the route is being used by enough people to order them regularly in the future .
the track is also very b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
just as you thought that 2017 may not be even more cra@@ zier , a new report comes about the technological developments in the area of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are a big thing at the moment .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robo@@ tics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robo@@ tics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Sh@@ ark@@ ey said in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are reached by artificial intelligence .
the user can &quot; adapt &quot; his robot according to his convic@@ tions and select everything from the eye colour of the robot to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it is still more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; person@@ ages &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progressive .
modern sex d@@ olls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre@@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of timi@@ dity and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion .
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
she also has her mo@@ ods in the course of the day - quite like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired , fixed to conversation or it can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one approaches a step at Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy .
their emergence and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something dark and deeper in our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted their growing popularity , they still remain on the br@@ ink of consumer culture .
but what tran@@ spi@@ red from the fr@@ ing@@ es can be very instruc@@ tive with regard to the spirit of the time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time in which the rights of women worldwide are threatened , in which there is a president in the White House who has bra@@ zed women to have been sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most horrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the intri@@ cate body and the st@@ och@@ ian eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as real@@ istically as possible ( even with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; person@@ ages , &quot; the robots are not real women .
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background story , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the 2017 Rede@@ mption : maid Task
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense
it has become a tr@@ ump @-@ wisdom of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US voters have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ selecting relatives .
we all re@@ strain all of us to burst our filter bubbles .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring families together .
I mention this because my cous@@ in , a left @-@ headed poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House anyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with whom she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and completely on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it is obvious to me that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the escap@@ ing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we talk about &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the sp@@ ook@@ y possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer rep@@ el us .
there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tr@@ ump Republi@@ can of the Right W@@ ing , which suddenly appears as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
today I think of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s hil@@ arious version of the mad man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both of which are in fact a very mild off@@ ence .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the re@@ public@@ ans must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the New York park &apos;s car@@ ous@@ el , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need a caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cra@@ mp@@ ed and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cli@@ mati@@ sing music conve@@ ys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city won &apos;t do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Them@@ es @-@ Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not a big round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magical experience , as here two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 &apos;s can go to it and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but luckily nobody asked for it .
on the other hand , this week I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I was able to pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tically gr@@ ins@@ ing while I tired the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts in his w@@ ri@@ sts , which he re@@ port@@ edly suffered from the prison authorities in a case in his cell .
he was sentenced for murder following an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first murder sentence .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 , firing it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night@@ time intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time to the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ eal , from which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosec@@ ution said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the four @-@ se@@ aters were dischar@@ ged from sho@@ ot@@ ers and suppos@@ it@@ ories into the vac@@ ations and secondary schools .
three of them will go to secondary school , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening the school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol of the dis@@ miss@@ al , the 29 students of the four classes headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young eagle growing up in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the m@@ lower band performed a musical titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ cken yard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it brood from his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chicken co@@ d came out a small eagle .
but the hope of making a chicken out of it sm@@ ashed , the eagle spread out its wings on a high mountain and s@@ wore .
after that , the classes showed a hen &apos;s dance three and four in Y@@ von@@ ne Frank &apos;s studio .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , who bore the cylinders to the bet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Eagle stands for the integration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the kit@@ ten is different from the other young ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished each four @-@ se@@ ater to feel accepted in his new school .
many thanks to the colleagues , the former school director Michael Müller , who always jumps in with instruc@@ tional courses and the parents .
now the cu@@ cum@@ ber season is over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher said .
she left her students only very reluc@@ t@@ antly after two years of teaching , because it had been a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the neighbour@@ hoods .
at the end all students heard a song of summer time and holiday season .
in doing so , great joy broke out among the children .
eight original trainees have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .
on the morning of 1 August a group of illeg@@ ally rooted people was arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is currently underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camping and impose significant fin@@ es to anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose . &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group have offered software updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars .
they are expected to improve the emissions behaviour of cars from emissions classes Euro 5 and in part Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin of ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new promotion mandatory ?
no , the software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Federal Office ( KBA ) has ordered their retro@@ fitting .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but have not yet been called an exact date .
Daimler has advised to write to each person concerned .
if any inspection is due anyway , this will be done within the scope of the inspection .
how long will the change@@ over take place altogether ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , voluntarily the autom@@ akers are not acting on the topic of the environment up to now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming could be to get an appointment .
what do mot@@ ori@@ sts do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ?
the ACE tells us to wait .
foreign manufacturers probably would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
in rural areas , there is currently no loss of losses for older diesel .
the ACE tells you to wait with a sale yet .
ll Cool J awarded Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Award Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become politically .
one of the winners doesn &apos;t want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool DJ ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) were among the honored .
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and participate in the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the award winner , Le@@ ar , announced with progressive TV series , therefore already announced that he would not attend the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ve them of the means - and that burdens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use the chat with Tr@@ ump in order to make clear her view .
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the biggest cultural institution in the US capital .
the former award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Urban Development Champion , will reti@@ re next year .
the job is already adverti@@ sed - however , suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker has been a city builder for 31 years .
and his work is still a lot of fun , as he medi@@ ates in the press conversation .
he reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , he is surprised that no application has so far fulfilled the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
thus , while resp@@ ecting the regular periods of notice , there should be enough time for famili@@ ar@@ isation .
since Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as a lower building authority , the applicant has to present appropriate conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they can &apos;t fill them anymore , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation .
but the clos@@ eness to the citizen is important to the city and to him , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working atmosphere and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens .
over 30 years in office some important projects have accumulated , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building ministry and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ cl@@ a are@@ al and the low @-@ ho@@ ven parking space have been initiated .
the bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and the stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will book about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
for a city building master , there is much room for manoeu@@ vre .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dening , many things can be re@@ acted quite flexibly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what will fit in &quot; when new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ises the out@@ going urban design master .
the mayor of the city is responsible anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs here over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on many years of staff in support and coordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker also wants his successor for a long time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

bicycle on lines thrown : southern run@@ way blocked
according to the police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators had thrown the blue bike from the railway line crossing in the area of the Le@@ oben Road ( B@@ 116 ) to the lines .
these were so severely damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them since the night .
near the scene of the crime scenes a sco@@ oter and a bicycle rider had been observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a bu@@ zz of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rators were in great danger themselves and were also at risk of train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay of delay and the costs of rail freight transport , other pat@@ rons may also be sent to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum was to be dealt with , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern run@@ way could be led without han@@ di@@ caps .
almost ten passenger trains dropped out on Friday morning , two of them concerned the long @-@ distance traffic .
freight trains did not fall out , but they had a delay .
according to Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study says exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting approximately 1.3 million and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while the suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to ease their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut .
the senior researcher , Dr Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the gut are pat@@ rolling to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body .
cells that are able to cause inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissue .
if the balance is too far towards inflammation , it may result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments , it was found that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lie@@ us fo@@ sters when the same system also s@@ wir@@ ls in humans .
the post@@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan investig@@ ates a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was stored separately , had not .
she presum@@ ed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice of mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species found in mice with immune cells were found , but lacking them in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria were acting on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism which is known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the mice &apos;s feed , the number of such cells increased by around 50 percent , but if tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan states that people have the same toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han secondary products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control infections on the intestinal surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed &quot; genius &quot; to Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United , with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a genius , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho writes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the final pr@@ el@@ ude game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup begins against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira advance at will .
matic was , however , excluded from the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks soccer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho started his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but he insist@@ ed that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of its four priority new commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; getting three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle to the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in the U.S. state of Mich@@ igan and took part in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing Logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turned out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD boss , S &amp; D prime ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern before elections .
only there was no fire from the central party , but no head@@ wind from the League - that was the chief desire of the electoral campaig@@ ners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz has led the party , it has changed fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the staff from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are observing the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals with a growing horror .
what Schulz has gotten from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were deep hits .
one after the other .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; once again , red @-@ green cannot reliably go@@ vern , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber , Germany &apos;s editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprising faction outlet of a Gre@@ ens Euro MPs pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the Parliament election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ German business@@ man Michael Kell@@ ner called on the dark Sax@@ on Green Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ westen to return their mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transition to CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the voters &quot; will . &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return her mandate , &quot; said the Federal Executive and El@@ ection Leader of the Green Party to the German Editorial Board ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD campaig@@ ner si@@ ghs when the new job message reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Stephan Wei@@ l , Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , El@@ ke T@@ westen combined green de@@ pu@@ ties to CD@@ U without their own government majority .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and no one knows what will happen next .
the Mis@@ ers began with the un@@ expect@@ edly sharp defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , not more , the comrades re@@ ass@@ ented themselves at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it was then - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD down , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te ble@@ w the party smoothly .
the comrades were lab@@ ori@@ ously ra@@ ped in the weeks after that .
then , when they had just stepped up new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next depression .
mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD governor , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his town was burning .
and because , in crisis communications , he wrong@@ ly made everything wrong , which one can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival .
so now Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW exhaust @-@ gas atmosphere and its role in the supervisory board , the Lower Saxony &apos;s prime minister has been in criticism for some time now .
average survey values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps because of this , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the federal government over the past few weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz .
they let him alone , because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party from Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
because of this , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the im@@ parti@@ ality of the Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz is not at all .
at times the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed to the Gre@@ ens , and here above all to the rebel@@ li@@ ous parliam@@ ent@@ arians of T@@ ests .
&quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic , how Ms. T@@ westen combined her own career interests over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frau T@@ westen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has not been elected as a direct candidate , but has been elected to Parliament via the state list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains of an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the choice of voters four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the SPD in Lower Saxony as a leading candidate in the federal election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U Euro MPs will fal@@ si@@ fy the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he demanded that the background be clari@@ fied .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been more commitments from the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding for local nucle@@ us III
if you want to renov@@ ate your old house in the years , you will soon be able to get support from the country .
informed mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representative St@@ eg city development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 , there have been in sensitive areas of re@@ development .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount .
in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area II between 2005 and 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler the previous restor@@ ations are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is finally important to promote interior development , and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , the government pres@@ i@@ dium of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a re@@ development area III .
the total amount was 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500@@ ,000 Euros would come from the country , the rest from the church sensi@@ tivities .
how does a rehabilitation area arise ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue investigating the Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned area at all .
if necessary , the regional boundaries could then be postpon@@ ed again .
the pi@@ er represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the programme is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out obj@@ ectively , that is per plot .
the re@@ development area would then finally be defined as a statute .
the granting period for the funding will continue until April 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , however , the survey would take place only once , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December the end of the year is to take place as much as possible so that the refur@@ bish@@ ment can begin next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann concluded that each commun@@ e had to carry out the alleged preliminary investigations .
it is about evaluating the urban conditions of urban development and deciding when to rehabil@@ itate and to what extent .
for the respective property there will also be a re@@ mark in the land register .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to the senses and take a picture of the situation , she promised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ zel emphasized that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires , which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and land sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where it is concerned , among other things , the structural condition and remedi@@ ation views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data on size , distribution and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Work@@ sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled if premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , please note that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new building measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler also stressed that the distribution of subsidies is functioning in accordance with the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle . &quot; who first comes first grin@@ ds first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funds for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; booking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; town center II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the audience &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has partner@@ ed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory firm in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standard .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the White House &apos;s shi@@ py@@ ards cost tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands of dollars
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ al helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that raises U.S. production last month , tax@@ pay@@ ers cost up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars according to the information provided by the military that was left to the TI@@ ME Magazine .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the Connec@@ tic@@ ut helicopter was issued next to a Ma@@ ine Yacht , a Wisconsin fire truck and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi fork lift .
the White House military office requested the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the Commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his supervis@@ or , the deputy commander of the nav@@ al aviation .
the news showed that on July 17th the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 p.m. and so long remained until the grass was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed , a second crew for the return flight would be required due to the limitation of the service hours .
the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter , while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft .
the recordings made by TI@@ ME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant .
&quot; sounds as if you are locked up , &quot; answered the deputy commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated as an official event by the White House and not covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus to reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is barely a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to request their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane landed in front of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , Taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compl@@ aining about the use of the presidential plane by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made In America , &quot; which shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to stop US President in the White House with precise centimet@@ res .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 exercise landscapes in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted at the training needs of the flying charter for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ Pres@@ idential support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers took the burden on none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man for Si@@ kor@@ sky said the company was not involved in presenting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget labels for the Pres@@ idential F@@ lights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the US Secretary of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for the reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but consider the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for whom so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is , of course , appropriate to highlight that . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially at the rear positions I find the crew very good . &quot;
imports from the high north are mainly concerned for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that will be difficult for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good dose of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high north is convenient .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress packed a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he et@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels is fo@@ aming the U.S. off@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft aims to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of the O@@ MV , who together with other European companies have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic sea pipeline Nord Stream 2 .
the dr@@ one setting is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an estimation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to raise the sanctions even by an Executive Order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at which the corporation could defl@@ ect and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

r@@ ô@@ le backwards : the city provides 46 kitchen workers
the town organizes the lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the city &apos;s day nur@@ series .
on September 1st the city of Kre@@ feld takes over food supply in the urban nur@@ sery schools ( Kit@@ as ) again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all enjoyed ourselves very much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking is continued in addition to the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and provides fresh boiled water .
in Kre@@ feld area , the city runs 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens , in 44 children receive a hot meal at lunch time .
in the last kit@@ esur@@ f year 28@@ 00 children were seated at the tables and the need grew steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children , who are cared for at least 45 hours per week , eat in the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care period when children up to 14 am staying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time forces have kitchen service from the 1st of September : they warm up the delivered food , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , proportion@@ ate the meal individually , give food out , clean up , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two group@@ ed as well as seven @-@ group institutions - decide on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen workers now belong firmly to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the management to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known strength in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita spaces - up to now also the task of the kitchen workers - will be done by a special cleaning staff in the future .
in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen , this variation - apart from the quality improvement of the kitchen service - also has the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical in terms of cost comparison for the city , it is said from the Press Office .
and this , although 46 partial @-@ time forces are re@@ configured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much weight at around 750 people in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting chief of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are candidates for the Council elections in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of the vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be representative and credi@@ ble if women participate un@@ reserv@@ edly and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the Provin@@ cial Council and the Pres@@ idential elections take place on April 5 .
the Tali@@ ban has issued threats against a choice process that coinci@@ de with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
this year , for the first time , the elections will be handed over to the next , peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent El@@ ection Commission reports that 1.2 million women of total registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

men try to ro@@ b 13 @-@ year old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to ro@@ b a 13 year old girl .
according to the police , the men spoke to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old , who kept up with friends on the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 2.@@ 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s cell phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and went on with her friends .
then one of the perpet@@ rators tried to grasp the cell phone and the necklace of the girl , which however failed .
without boot@@ y the duo fled .
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a trade union would like to as@@ certain the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow in case of managers of the Bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland said the company kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work at the plant producing hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits in addition to other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insist@@ ence on expressing &quot; concerns that financing for modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t win clarity about our business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply concerned with our members .
generations of families have worked here and labor powers concentrate heavily on the local community and the Glasgow , an important column for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production , the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently needed a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D spokesperson at Pla@@ in : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross decided only yesterday to receive a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it as we value the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are continually checking our business - and that applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and completely . if our operational processes change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
does PS@@ G Barcelona have warned of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the side of La league may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not reti@@ re from the persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar after giving an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record attack ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the most paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catalan vesti@@ bu@@ le insi@@ sts that the club always gave its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned of the PS@@ G president three years ago ?
when Manchester City was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; I am not concerned because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players with them , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association expressing interest in the PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International of Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter tos@@ sed and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpet@@ r@@ ator deliberately dropped off a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld street in front of the estate number 30 .
the Police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for clu@@ es .
the police seek witness to an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
because a car came to meet him on his lane , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ red the guard rail .
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um with his VW went on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au towards Le@@ ese on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au .
in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au a passenger car came to meet him on his lane so that he had to turn right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the guard rail .
on passenger cars , material damage was created .
the driver of the coming car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident report , it can be good that the Merc@@ ed@@ es@@ driver had not noticed the accident at all .
the police now ask witnesses to the incident as well as the driver of the cause of the cause to contact the comm@@ iss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au , tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Report reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann says .
the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
Christian Wei@@ z@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; declared after publication in front of the German press agency , he received an ap@@ ology from the former Chief Apostle Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the pap@@ al Pope Bene@@ dict XVI .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger express deep regre@@ ts over their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false app@@ rais@@ al of the events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand critic@@ ised that reporting on domestic violence was measured with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the attacks in Regensburg , nobody doubts that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ do@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of den@@ ying the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ do@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk , Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said : &quot; we like to go to the church and this is a found fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been a normal pedago@@ gical instrument , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cope with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the mis@@ use cases , Fr . Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often also appeared .
completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann says , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the memory of &quot; My brother the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I have to protect Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber asked by the bish@@ op@@ ric of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment ?
between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ) were victims of aggression between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , 67 dom@@ spar@@ rows sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be noted that R. in many cases were used forms of physical and psychological violence .
especially in case of high emotional appeal , the punishment for the students could also be more intense .
however , in contrast to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims estimate the common humanity of R. , and therefore , in many cases , even bring positive memories to him despite violence . &quot;
in the interview , H@@ ess@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger feels reli@@ eved of his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the alleged incidents of perpet@@ rators of violence in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , many students emphasize his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became more tangible to the latter if a domin@@ ating kit didn &apos;t bring top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as your bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears at all .
he has just been dedicated to eight sides and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ knowing in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool also occurred outside of his sphere of influence .
at best , one can reproach it , learn from it too late , or have taken first indications not seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um on which he worked was perceived as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger expresses an excellent testimony , describing him as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers , who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always surrounded by the grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained of his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to acute out@@ breaks .
that he did not just kne@@ ad with chairs and threw the key ring on the ground , but also distributed ear@@ phones and too fre@@ ak@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he himself admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ olog@@ ised for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the era of question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what this report actually deals with , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school , these are certainly dre@@ ad@@ els .
one wonders whether it has to do with his fame and role as a brother of Bene@@ dict XVI that many media have just crashed on him .
on the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who never understood him are still working dili@@ gently .
but the truth is : the report is reli@@ eved by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in connection with the report , a great deal was reported in the media about abuse of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is it possible for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger to carry out any involvement or co @-@ operation with regard to sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have committed themselves to the cathedral kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecrated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one affected representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the explanation of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not even confi@@ de to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir director , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
what is the role of R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s dom@@ ici@@ le students in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely re@@ ali@@ zations and would have been able to stop the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that counting on it ... boo@@ ths have opened more insist@@ ently or more clearly or sooner rather than their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trust@@ worthy teachers , etc .
that one talks to him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free of charge .
so he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the display .
therefore there is no reason to link his good name with these dist@@ ressing crimes , as happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence ex@@ its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this reproach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed up to a huge number of sexual abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere , right in the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is exactly the abuse of the report .
there is , namely , clean@@ ly separated : between the pre @-@ school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non@@ violence as well , we say once , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades where Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the dome @-@ cats .
all the terrible review pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were literally har@@ assed and ab@@ duc@@ ted , took their place at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where there were really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got to face the boys when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this , as most witnesses emphasize , the theme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primary school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed such a much better treatment and for many even para@@ dis@@ es .
what else was there in the gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report concludes that &quot; many victims estimate the common humanity of R. , and therefore , in many cases , even bring positive memories to him despite violence . &quot;
at most the accused remains to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and of the events at a school where he didn &apos;t work and was responsible , ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then back in 1993 .
does Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently protect the ears from the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um , which even reproduced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this point he points out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool the punishment may continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as testing pun@@ ish@@ ments were also banned in Bavaria .
before that they occurred in a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows .
it was difficult to estimate the extent to which those affected were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where the permitted limit was really exceeded .
but one cannot say that he had always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the punishment of schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis claimed that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards on that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we histori@@ ans are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; meaning the danger of judging the past in today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess was right there .
but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was disgu@@ sting at all times and also not for what was bre@@ ached in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that at that time .
it &apos;s all aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it will finally work .
but at the same time I must protect Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , such as sla@@ ying the ears and the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then banned , he has also kept strict adher@@ ence to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his Regensburg Conference did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger play in the conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject test drive apply to speech ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Bene@@ dict XVI .
nevertheless , I did not at all admit that he carried out a strict regi@@ ment there .
but this also has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world d@@ rank , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , one does not once again make a great singer and stand before every success , no matter in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of person did you experience as Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the conversations with her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , humor@@ ous , deeply believ@@ able and aff@@ ection@@ ate people , from whom one cannot imagine that he could also do something in a fly .
I regularly get in touch with him , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ ans today , 23 years after his deport@@ ation , regularly contact him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who have not forgiven him until this day , that he was once stern to them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ ans are thank@@ ful to him today for enrich@@ ing their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , father @-@ friendly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a loving respect for which they still look and worship them down@@ right .
and please , once again quite clear : all that is presented to him are educational methods that were on the order of the day at that time .
we can be glad that we have long since overcome this time .
but it &apos;s highly unfair to make a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a media sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that stands behind it , all too obvious .
for the report that was published is reli@@ eved of him .
now the state would command , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
