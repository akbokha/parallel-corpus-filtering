<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">A Irren-Anstalt, where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "small farmers cultivate the former cause of farmers." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It gets nervous when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, who had to get upset, because the car navigation device showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are anything but up-to-date - but very informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a pair of Flickenteppich, which one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">For cities and municipalities detailed maps, so-called sentencing leaves, were incorporated into the large map.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops were finally drafted with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801 they were today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max. Joseph further drove the project forward, founded the" "" "Topographical Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian surveying administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The copyright sheet for Munich dates back to the year 1856 and is to be found like all others on the Bayerische Landesbibliothek's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was established as a Munich suburb for 21 years after the map was created.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 on today's Plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first sight: when zooming in, a smaller-part card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered flutes from the so-called "original photograph" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots there are no more farmers today - but farmers in the plant" "" "land in the sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the October festival, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "on the guest's dough" or "On the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeld street people once locked up people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich District Irrenaissance" "" "On the Auer Ventilation" "" "was created." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard of Gudden conducted the institution - that psychiatrist, who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive in his time, and for example ended the banquet of so-called Irish." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibited the personnel from applying violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients, there was first place, later extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was insufficient - the reason for the construction of the Circles in Hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar Amper Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet in the Munich Salesianism area on the site of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015 the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was erected - in architectural reference to the original building of the Irrenasylum, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in bombing attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was registered as" "" "Main Square" "" "in 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allied bombs broke many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line-line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights group publishes Travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Farms has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri because of the discriminatory politics and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here," stated in the Group's statement.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes people more difficult to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state law enforcement agencies which disproportionately target minorities, caused the group to publish the travel warning, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "you have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group quoted incidents like racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during the journey and was put into custody by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the Missouri General Attorney Office showing that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be prepared if they bring chewing money or let relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 Hassan crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the Hassan-report of the FBI, which classify the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company due to housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws that would oblige local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling in view of the ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently, interest groups have deployed the measure in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Turndown project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fishermen's Didezvous Project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have created a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the CDU local association gathered together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the pivotal court of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially granted insight into his operation, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk cows and as many young animals and houses the guests in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest" "" "is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">Exclusively regionales are placed on the table of the Feriengaeste.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also BLHV president of the fisherman's bach, he described the fence project as" "" "fundamental importance." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "I cannot manage to profit profitably on such steep faces." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area care for a lot of work, much needs to be processed with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental plant and cultivated it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it does not lead a biogas plant.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the significance of the turnaround project and is glad about the Leader promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers should be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "" "" "I hope that the afforestation of the land could be extended for quite a while." ""</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their business," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of fostering</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The surface area is therefore 40 hectares, which may not be afforested by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was promoted by the leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 km of wheat fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and farm women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "Peter Weiß asserted that" "" "the best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Sequence Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the government to promote public fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to preserve the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The precondition is the existence of a conveying set indicated by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the area to be protected may not be worse (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by forestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fishermen's Fortunic project in 2018, the application consists of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build just under 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The accounting area is equivalent to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes on the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged downfall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump régime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN on the President's proposals to drastically restrict the legal migration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller didn't handle the statue himself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have landed him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he grabbed their importance, and in particular the meaning attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the memorial, was added to his base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller told Acosta, "I don't want to go into a complete affair about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem you refer to is added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is properly speaking, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, your oppressed masses, longing to breathe freely, the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "was better seen on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: indeed, it is a conflict about the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends, who used to place their words on the base after her death - knew very well that she performed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in its poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty didn't invite anybody, but rather an early neo-conservative that puts the American flame into the recounted world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is intended to bear the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not light the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh found something unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is completely and even a matter of point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them in such a way as they were seen by the exhausted, eleventful, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue says to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever would like to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not light the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers one time when only two Scotsmen belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"" "the performance director of the UK Athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship header" "" "will make a massive contribution to the team." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"" "black believes that" "" "in Scotland something special is developed" "" "and the athletics of the UK must learn something from it." ""</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue until we find it," "" "said Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they've done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m distance, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "their Captain speech was incredible," "" "says Black." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought up naturally were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships at 400 m Hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the UK team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best overall number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-stream-runner Muir leads along this path and last year has established five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1.500 m and the 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1.500 m, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "enormously proud" of the fact that many of their fellow countrymen are not only part of the team, but also in some cases will be involved in the medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my team-mates voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes, who want to climb to podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">As for my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that in this situation we are very happy as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"" "I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking critics on Facebook: do not worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers hit him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He cries in criticism, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in 1783 Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led as sheep for slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 persons, who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And that is why the American Civil Liberties Union canceled it earlier this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overpowering democratic state which is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair-loose head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blockage of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum, is known as officially and by employees paid with public tax dollars - needless and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," "" "she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't like this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are despised by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the Governor's staff referred to as" "" "concentrated spam attack" "", "others would probably call" "" "intercession." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when the same thing had been done that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical lyritics and to arrest and silence demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what is happening in digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors des Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable port had a similar effect on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers was multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters tachographs beat him.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">People using pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions, who criticised his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his ministry, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence her.</seg>

<seg id="350">In response, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and arbitrarily taken into custody in recent years, under the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty."</seg>

<seg id="413">The company said it interviewed travelers throughout the country to find out how many inadvertently picked up smuggled goods by airport security and how many would have done it intentionally.</seg>
<seg id="414">It is no surprise that people who are most likely to smugglers - knowingly or unknowingly - bear through security, those who fly most frequently.</seg>

<seg id="421">"" "electric-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to deal with the huge number of preorders for his new Tesla" "" "Model 3" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="422">He has so far suggested that some of the clients have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the ever-triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla boss Elon Musk has for the first time betrayed another, less glittering number in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">During the past few months, Musk had frequently recruited more than 500,000 orders for the new car, whose delivery just started.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now, Musk concedes: of the total of 518,000 orders, 63.000 have already been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation payment."</seg>
<seg id="428">At present 45,000 of such non-binding reservations, Musk cleaned up in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to now around twelve per cent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in demand but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">2018 - all models will be put together - 500,000, 2020 one million.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is evident.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, there are currently 1,800 reservations per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you order a Model 3 today, you may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand-new production lines tested in practice without any major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">But if there are too much delays, then the non-binding of the reservations might become a problem for Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="438">Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.</seg>

<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint filed against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"" "" "" "it is about a period running on 1 October for States to comply with the 2015 standards for ozone." ""</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he would delay adherence to a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth. "</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who before his appointment as President Donald Trump prosecutor of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt repeatedly passed over to block or delay regulators that oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>

<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA steward exceeded his authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his reversal of ozone standards simply reflects the willingness of the EPA for co-operation with the States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "under previous administrations, EPA has often failed to comply with deadlines and then waited to be charged by activists and others, and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation," "" "said Pruitt, who defaulted the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job."

<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the Ozone rules.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumbling celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius's Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the town, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors of Tumlingens their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasises: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergische Manueline: count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on the mountain of Tumlinger, apart from the former parish church, there was also a noble court to which the Church or the Patronate Law belonged, and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumles, the "Berg" of the third, the noble settlement nucleus of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 re-substantiate these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A master who built, fitted out a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could bequeath this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">As a result, the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two was broken at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but later had to be left in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648) window panes were smashed and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church mill and used it as a firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger's Hilarius cemetery was also used as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve in 1834 a storm split the steeple and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-werg still existing today remained the witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the Hilarius facility by Dieter Dockhorn as successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organizers, the friends and promoters of Tumlingens invite to the St. Hilariuskapelle cemetery on Sunday, 16 July, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the Combo of the Kepler high school Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Hartmut Romann is talking about the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="499">To the end of the serenade a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," "" "the organizers put out the fantastic view." ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade only takes place in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius complex, which is important to Tumble and Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and sponsors of Tumlingens are particularly committed to the care of their home care, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini affirms.</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "" "" "Boisheim defends" "" "does not see any legal precondition for the construction and has therefore turned to the councillor." ""</seg>
<seg id="506">The "Boisheim" association has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at that time in Viersen only at the border to Schwalmtal a wind power concentration camp existed.</seg>
<seg id="509">In this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration camp causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones are intended to prevent "pardon" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">A few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided to change the area of land use a second wind turbine concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette - but this had not authorized the district government of Düsseldorf because of a mold missing.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "due to the lack of planning legal requirement, the granted approval letter is still illegal and therefore also withdrawn," "" "said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of" "" "Boisheim defends himself." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="513">Current state of affairs: before the summer break, the City Council again resolved the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.</seg>

<seg id="517">The circle makes it an occasion to reconsider the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">"" "with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argument of the association" "" "Boisheim" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a NEW subsidiary company, is planning to build four 200-metre high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen participated indirectly, closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be met - that corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity demand of all four-thousander households.</seg>
<seg id="523">New Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen's city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Linnich near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the Kreis Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="532">Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping facilities in the city centre in September.</seg>
<seg id="533">The trade association and city administration intend to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to lure the inhabitants for shopping in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="534">As the president of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend aims to sensitize customers what offers the city's own city away from the usual supermarket commodity.</seg>
<seg id="535">Therefore, a market with regional providers is planned, similar to the weekly market.</seg>
<seg id="536">In addition, local firms should present themselves with their training vacancies.</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition, the shops of the city centre are to invite for "midday shopping."</seg>
<seg id="538">The campaign aims not only on residents of the city and the nearby region.</seg>
<seg id="539">In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags, which refer to the action weekend, says Christian König.</seg>
<seg id="540">The City Council and the Business Association co-operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</seg>
<seg id="541">Thus the commercial association and the city go into a further stage of the project "Attractive downtown."</seg>
<seg id="542">This includes new offerings such as the first "Active Day" to the well-known well-established Sunday, talks with all tradesmen and hosts in order to move them to active participation.</seg>
<seg id="543">Attractive offers for Saturday and the abandonment of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.</seg>
<seg id="544">In addition, customer potentials are to be reopened or reopened.</seg>
<seg id="545">This includes spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But also many locals would have lost the city center when shopping.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end everyone would have to contribute to liven the city center - to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.</seg>
<seg id="548">It was rewarding to overcome the lethargy with a network that partly broadened, king said in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="549">Birgit Streich, Director of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities will take part in the third "home-shopping" day.</seg>

<seg id="664">The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar DENIC) shows either a shabby street corner together with the Wall of the Wall and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Playlist and Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.</seg>
<seg id="665">Before that, an open Mercedes classic car is parked in which the Rheinhunters pose as rock-ergirls, or alternatively a Isetta.</seg>
<seg id="666">Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorfs's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which moves through its "ring" staging.</seg>
<seg id="667">The three Rheinhunters - sung by Stephanie Houtzel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize beautifully as already in the "Rheingold."</seg>
<seg id="668">KESS perform Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), disassemble a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood-fashion and give the Krawallo clique.</seg>
<seg id="669">Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen surrounding the aura of a heavy weight punching bag.</seg>
<seg id="670">Brutally the scene, when he shot Siegfried.</seg>
<seg id="671">Later Gunther (Markus Oak) still has to believe it.</seg>
<seg id="672">The audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause.</seg>
<seg id="673">Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrated in a stormy fashion, who humble himself and forestall the hands of Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="674">There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which shows itself on stage for the first time - in light of the great heat again in casual leisure clothes.</seg>
<seg id="675">The gig was eagerly awaited by Frank Castorf and his team.</seg>
<seg id="676">In 2013 he had to leave a gable pipe concert over himself, there were five years later great jubilation, in which the scattered "buh" reputations went down.</seg>
<seg id="677">Festspielchefin Katharina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "" "" "you notice that the audience has grown together with the" "" "Ring" "" "in a way," "" "she said shortly before the performance of the dpa." ""</seg>
<seg id="679">The public did not only make a form of peace with Castorf, but it was also an understanding of its perception.</seg>
<seg id="680">I draw a positive résumé.</seg>
<seg id="681">Max amount works as a volunteer</seg>
<seg id="682">They work in several places at the same time as a volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="683">Where everywhere?</seg>
<seg id="684">Quantity: usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I also worked on the school in the open whole day.</seg>
<seg id="686">How are your experiences with it?</seg>
<seg id="687">Quantity: it is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.</seg>
<seg id="688">I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.</seg>
<seg id="689">You are now 26 years, so a late-time volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="690">How does that come about?</seg>
<seg id="691">Amount: I did a SLC.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a civil engineer's degree, let's say, successfully demolished.</seg>
<seg id="693">I realized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different with people.</seg>
<seg id="694">And then I asked myself what are you doing.</seg>
<seg id="695">Do a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is on the spot, at the focal point maybe also, really.</seg>
<seg id="696">And was it so?</seg>
<seg id="697">Amount: I collected some great impressions.</seg>
<seg id="698">I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester.</seg>
<seg id="699">I am going to study dual, probably doing a social worker training in Jugendamt Herne and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.</seg>
<seg id="700">Is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?</seg>
<seg id="701">Quantity: yes, it is very variable.</seg>
<seg id="702">It probably depends on where you are doing the FSJ.</seg>
<seg id="703">It can be done from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.</seg>
<seg id="704">With me it was very varied.</seg>
<seg id="705">I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon supervision.</seg>
<seg id="706">For me it was exactly the right thing that irritated me.</seg>
<seg id="707">I could see my own strengths and see how it really works.</seg>
<seg id="708">In contrast to studies in civil engineering?</seg>
<seg id="709">A lot: sure, here it's not about calculating statics.</seg>
<seg id="710">You always have other people in front of you, each having a completely different story behind them.</seg>
<seg id="711">Whether a refugee or a young person who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.</seg>
<seg id="712">Very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="713">And you didn't have reservations?</seg>
<seg id="714">Quantity: for this I am not the type.</seg>
<seg id="715">It is an area that gives a lot.</seg>
<seg id="716">Lots of love, great kindness.</seg>
<seg id="717">There are also negative moments, but life is like that.</seg>

<seg id="719">The British education group Pearson said on Friday that she will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut off her interim dividend by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces.</seg>
<seg id="720">The job reduction, which Director General John Fallon announced chiefly for the end of 2018 and early 2019, comes in addition to its previous restructuring, where 4,000 jobs have already been lost.</seg>
<seg id="721">In May, Pearson announced a cost reduction plan for a further 300 million pounds ($394 million) in a third cost reduction program in order to revive a business that was hit by the fast pace to digital learning.</seg>

<seg id="723">Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing</seg>
<seg id="724">A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a soldier of NATO and injured several others, says officials.</seg>
<seg id="725">Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, shared an explanation by NATO.</seg>
<seg id="726">According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died in the QArab quarter.</seg>
<seg id="727">The bombing is the last violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a Herat mosque on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="728">On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="729">In a NATO statement, it is said that the explosion happened on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised explosive force."</seg>
<seg id="730">The statement states that all injuries are in a stable state and be treated in the US military hospital on the Bagram airfield.</seg>
<seg id="731">Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qaragh is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.</seg>
<seg id="732">According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilian casualties occurred in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="733">At the end of July, a suicide bomb blast killed at least 30 people in a mostly Shiite district of Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="734">The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.</seg>
<seg id="735">On 31 May a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most lethal militant attack in the country, since the US-led troops in 2001 pushed the Taliban off power.</seg>
<seg id="736">The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump attends to increase the number of U.S. troops that support military and police in the country.</seg>
<seg id="737">Correspondents say that in recent weeks the suicide bombings in Kabul also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies, and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.</seg>

<seg id="739">The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration, repealed that the states are obliged to curb the smog-causing emissions. this occurred a day after 15 states complained to the Agency because of the step.</seg>
<seg id="740">"" "the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so-called" "" "OzonRules 2015" "", "and said it shows the agency's commitment to co-operate with states." ""</seg>

<seg id="742">In June Pruitt had announced the intention of EPA to measure the ozone regulations - in which pollutant emissions should be measured in a part of the country, in order to comply with stricter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018.</seg>
<seg id="743">A group of 15 largely democratic states, along with the Columbia district, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.</seg>
<seg id="744">The government of President Donald Trump has tried to return a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that is to boost economic growth according to Trump.</seg>

<seg id="747">Community wants community room</seg>
<seg id="748">At the end, the decision was clear: with two counterparts, the Common at Fluorn-Wintzen approves the establishment of a community space in the future retirement home.</seg>
<seg id="749">Before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing part of the property is signed, reports mayor Bernhard Tjaden.</seg>
<seg id="750">Although it will still take a long time until the church community has so far been part of the community, there is no planning obstacle for the project to be stemmed by a private investor.</seg>
<seg id="751">There is a discussion about a common space.</seg>
<seg id="752">One of the two investors still in the boat offered to meet the community.</seg>
<seg id="753">On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - some 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price.</seg>
<seg id="754">The administration and the majority of the municipal council are hovering that such a community space cannot be seen as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the seniorent housing, but openly into the congregation.</seg>
<seg id="755">"" "as an example, the word from the" "" "knitting café" "" "made the rounds." ""</seg>
<seg id="756">The decision, which was already decided by the provision of funds for the current budget in the last autumn, will be swept aside by funding opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="757">The building is located in the rehabilitation area.</seg>
<seg id="758">"" "" "" "the establishment of a common room would be, so reports Tjades, with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible." ""</seg>
<seg id="759">The proposal foresees to signal the investor, that in this respect it is not possible to throw a billet between the legs, the statement that both saddle and pitch roof - as well as pent roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="760">Not only Wilfried Sohmer thinks that this addition is unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="761">If it helps: he passes the body unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="762">It's not that easy with the common room.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "Daniela's reputation refers to the many of his own buildings with which one does not get so well ahead, but now you lean out of the window at the community room, she says:" "" "I'm really doing it with it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Yvonne Staiger speaks for the common room - but absolutely against communal participation.</seg>
<seg id="765">It sees behind it a covered subsidy to investors anyway, or even foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id="766">This is not so, because with the purchase of the space one does not grant a subsidy, but gets a real equivalent in the case of doubt, is the counter-speech.</seg>
<seg id="767">At the same time, Staigers's proposal to plead the proposal is made up of three proponents.</seg>
<seg id="768">This is the case with two counterparts in the original program, which summarizes Stefan Haller: "if we handle the decision, we make a huge step in closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the Financial Regulations of Football affect Neymars Moving to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded issues of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come true for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the management organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by UEFA means PSG has to prove at some point that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy Brazilians from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make money loose for Neymar to sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the power-rich royal family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs must pay a lot of money for the purchase of players, but have to counteract with legitimate income sources, which allow them the break-even point in their activities related to football.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Former French player believed that clubs, which had taken enormous debt in their quest for success, effectively deceive and risked to ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, which Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003, bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen in favour of the Presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to discourage excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will definitely increase the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, responsible for the UEFA UEFA, compared with The Associated Press in the past week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although PSG has paid the Buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the selling price for the next five years can be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">PSG received a fine of €60 million (at that time 82 million dollars), which later fell to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outsmart their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Qatari company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered a legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the PSA's sponsorship was inflated by Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments of the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 fought against Neymar World Cup ambassadors to be and could easily find out such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulatory authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "the current sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to ignore any attempt to bypass the rules." ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymars Transfer, on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press since they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last financial year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signing.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going to see, and she tried to prevent Neymars's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>

<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>

<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there's another crazy evil plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good example of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, exams are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is particularly fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons under the lip of "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of accidental madness that could fuel this franchise just like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches that which I suppose as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the band premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">In the meantime, "Comrade Detective" on Amazon reminds us of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-West-West-Ring-Iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka is to be a bound TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two Bucharest officers, who fight for truth, atheism and the road of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues are synchronised by Channing Tatum (also an extensive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice flags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides a decent match 'Finds the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - often as one plays.</seg>
<seg id="1206">In six long episodes, it moves away, and the comedy is not fast or frequent.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," which was edited on a lower length, could better deliver its agitprop satire, since Gregory and Iosef continue to visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>

<seg id="1215">During the same raids in Italy two persons were arrested.</seg>
<seg id="1216">There were German arrest warrants against the suspect Italians.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced himself from a big house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is evidence of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I was looking for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot flat has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne closet space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed von Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is rather complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the spaces in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down.</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine floor, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we offer mirrored units space for all cutlery and jars made by Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering art went in," "" "explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is mutual important, so it is very easy to slide the door when you move the door." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne gains additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the size of the ground." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they succeeded in enlarging the floor space and at the same time using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious benefit.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and which help to create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you do not love the electrical sockets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "these are important, but they don't play with your heart." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that a flat can be transformed by a good design and an increased square footage of something by default in something very astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave this.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers Struggle for a $500 Million in Real Estate Imperium</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a dispute due to one of the largest real estate agents of Victorias worth more than $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the Carlton Football Club and Developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp conflict about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a business in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold to US $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center, the areas of development of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin was described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A legal file states that this means that Colin owns property worth 316 million dollars and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">"" "" "" "the division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem point for Paul." ""</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the divisions proposed by Colin have left him behind what I kept for the best objects," "" "he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed attempts, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also struggle to control the existing business - Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accused Paul of managing some possessions incompetently.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit that was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian heritage states that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs increase in the case, with hundreds of sites with affiridavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both parties.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, where Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark are," "" "Paul says," "" "has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin was very shy, although he was a former AFL member of the board and after a biography of 2015 by Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"" "only Colin responded by sms to say" "" "I really can't say much," "" "because the case is in front of the courts." ""</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the media's abstinence from the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and have failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including reports from the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with executive employees on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to fix: poor information that has fallen into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television commercials are still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was annoyed for unfair reporting it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were to convince," "" "said the former election campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February opposite Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep Trumps Twitter custom under control, according to six former election campaign officials, insists that his personal media consumption involves a constant praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know - that Trumps tweets would have contained even more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his collaborators managed to keep him out of trouble for a few times, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, will always try to present their own agenda by presenting trump material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to give the president questionable information for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump-officials say that Trump can react like a volcano on negative press cuts, especially those with humiliating leaks, and that he insists on finding out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">That was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused Katie Walsh, "the source behind a bunch of leak" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter due to chicanes or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and has revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and began asking people about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Gold makers added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work out?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys Mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1444">From Birkenhof forest hotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Luise Forest Hotel is located in the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is being renovated and is to be opened again on the 1st of March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente company ltd. to 13 April 2014, approximately 30,000 nights per year were lost and income from the city tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered to the District Council as a collective shelter, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadts Lord Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke at that time by serious interested parties in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group of Luisenyi with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt property.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenhauser.</seg>
<seg id="1457">They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>

<seg id="1459">The floors have been torn out, ceilings partly broken down, old bathtubs are removed from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>

<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery."</seg>
<seg id="1467">Swimming pool, wellness centre and meeting room belong to the facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1468">You don't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale inner city level, Scherer emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Luise forest hotel with about 60 rooms wants to spread wide, explains Scherer further.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">He has already led talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, so Scherer.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia affair: U.S. Special Investigator sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special promoter Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called Grand Jury upon a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "in recent weeks, the committee has recorded the work," "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "wrote on appeal to persons familiar with the cause." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper presented the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The broadcaster CNN reported that there are already initial charges in connection with a meeting between Trumps oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to have purposefully intervened in the 2016 presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between Trumps campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigations will focus on several men acting as advisers to the Republicans during the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports Mueller took a close look at more and more Trumps for private and business environments.</seg>
<seg id="1488">A few weeks ago, the "Washington Post" wrote several weeks ago that the Special Investigator Trump moved personally to the centre and undertook the accusation whether the President could possibly hinder the judiciary in the wake of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Juries is to examine the present evidence in possible criminal cases and decide if prosecution is to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand juries are therefore also called anchor clips.</seg>
<seg id="1491">They are usually turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor's office in order to invite individuals to the company under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN, invitations were already issued, which revolved around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement, they stated in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. also Trumps advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his female election campaign manager Paul Manafort were involved in the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the translation show that Mueller does not let himself be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be involved in the end to decide on the collection of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the setting up of the committee is the start of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause of concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the theme gives the democrats an opportunity to" "" "feel good" "", "because they have nothing else to talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the substitution of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this usually works in secret, he emphasised.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House advocates all measures that accelerated the work of the Special Orders in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that it is not against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to assume that something has changed, it was stated in the Declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Mueller was first used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this revocation, accusations against Trump have become loud, he have hindered the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Commenting on a Senate Committee in June, Comey asked him to set up investigations against the former national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After displaying US media, the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller was to be released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair about the later receded President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the behest of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of republican and democratic senators presented bills on Thursday, after which the Special Investigator could no longer be released so easily.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the west Antarctica a giant iceberg from the narrowly seven-times size of Berlin was solved.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was shared by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The colossus sweeping over a trillion ton and 5800 square kilometers is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it melts.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">It is not a threat to human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1524">The extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear according to research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs of ice cream cones in the region for around 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfest.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfest floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow further into the sea and breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfest is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this horseshoe was disturbed by the balance of waxes and breakage a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete interview can be found there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say, that the Larsen-C-Schelfest is in danger, because the front edge has never been as far back as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate stands under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of Schelcowl and Eisberg does not increase sea level, as they float on the water and ice as much water as it yields after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could potentially increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelfest is the fourth-largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," "" "he affirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Scientists were arguing whether the Larsen-C-Schelfest will grow back or go back in the long term and possibly fall together, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these researchers do not relinquish the abrupt of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many of the Antarctic ice rinsets have fallen apart during the last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the research programme of the British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Survey's ice surface has declined by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the last 50 years and thus enumerates the areas in which the temperature is the fastest rising.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants to work at the front of the house</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU asks to step out of the employers' association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only a short time before the summer break, 41 new jobs were traged in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>

<seg id="1556">Approximately 620 applications were recorded for the places to be awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the group still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Currently there are 50 unoccupied places in the district of Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1559">We are looking for doctors and engineers, as well as forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and meet the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "the administration is to develop a concept for human resources and personnel development according to the" "" "desire of the parties" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to meet short-term demand for skilled workers but to counteract the future-oriented applications of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented inwards and outwardly, showing concrete measures for cross-entrants and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you did not know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, the leader of the CDU, will go beyond the joint request with his party.</seg>

<seg id="1574">The CDU tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually foresees the tariff for public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently prescribed exactly, increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level that is oriented towards career years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitution protection law.</seg>

<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they are not allowed to continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations." ""</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis Warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German aid organisation 'Youth Retained' because their crew had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to express itself to detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, saving human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone," "" "said the organization in an opinion on the social media." ""</seg>

<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Retained', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew will take dinghy migrants aboard, which will be delivered directly by traffickers and that smugglers can take off so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting was claimed only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's Act, whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of putting away the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have previously agreed to stick to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>

<seg id="1594">In the meantime, Minni said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations has declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the minister." ""</seg>

<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermer Bikers, the "Berliner Outer Post" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the northern Palatinate, to enjoy Trials and attractions for four days.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal was a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest from Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour conducted at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">There were viewpoints, some on towers, from which one could look far above the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were again and again longer climbs, for the long Trials rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again, there was a lookout point to the lookout point, connected by "flowered" trials and moderate ascents.</seg>

<seg id="1613">Do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future instead of being forced to fight through the stadium speed in the event of wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact: e-sport has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">They also recognized the first Bundesligavereine, who are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and took two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract.</seg>

<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain, or PSV Eindhoven, for example, have qualified.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football, in particular, must deal with the 14-30-year-olds, that young people will also go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under contract, one could be present online by far more often on these markets than to send the Bundesligamannie to Asia once a year.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In the E-sport, computer games such as League Of Legends, "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the FIFA World Cup simulation will focus on competition level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, leagues have long since established themselves, in which the professionals compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the 2022 World Cup, e-sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a proper sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Froboso has also been dealing with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sport - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction capacity.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should train not only at the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the Fitte player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"" "however, it also sees problems:" "" "doping is becoming more and more a topic." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1639">The scientists emphasise the high integrative impact of e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">The players are on the move internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association for Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsorship and large tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, sales are expected to lie at 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">This is little against the nearly 2.4 billion euro of the Bundesliga football league.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, e-sport is not far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey, "writes the Deloitte consultants.</seg>
<seg id="1646">Many countries are already international.</seg>

<seg id="1680">The case seems to be a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to call upon another to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case attracted national attention after Carters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW announced that it would offer to update the software in over 350,000 vehicles.</seg>

<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the undertakings as recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with regulations for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are regarded as carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of car manufacturers to install systems for neutralization of exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles also increases what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of plouting the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies attempt to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called amortisation equipment, which could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but driving back in normal driving conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1761">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.</seg>

<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accuse Audi to have installed a system to bypass the emissions regulations in Europe, and a request that focused on the United States has been expanded.</seg>
<seg id="1764">Volkswagen's involvement in the investigation would be hard to put on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes proportionately to the win of Volkswagen.</seg>

<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agrarian research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is highly endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which in spring has brought much less rain and much more in the fall.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the service life of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cichade, a micro-bacterium, that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are very many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much at stake.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist emphasises the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists will discuss what is more secure: they should take their children into the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a tablet at the front of the room: enemies, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and stomach feelings are enough.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected to stand on the government's payroll or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest period of violence, and while the corpses accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. after attacks and threats under federal law and so far, there were at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter are her editors and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "said Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, who show his smiling face with glasses or his typical panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after its death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Special Public Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has only launched two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As in most of the thousands of killings, which are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely tried in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now even more puzzling.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting has little benefit to the discussion of security, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we mistrust everyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter stopped in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is practically nothing to silence about Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans' arrest in the United States last year and the extradition in the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa anyone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storeyed mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">At first there was in February the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gait members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to not force Valdez to leave the country for its own security following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars of shareholdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate journalism without bumping into the intoxicant problem," "" "said Boyorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper has earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising declined.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Award" for their reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his Courage in the Persecution of Mexican Drug History, wherever she was leading.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up willingly that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to keep alive," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ Award." ""</seg>

<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team miss Valdez, the fun bird that could curb like a dock worker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>

<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Was His love to the routine be calamity?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Boyorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, "said the publisher of Riodoce Andres Villarreal that" smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the matter with Javier is happening. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as not in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smugglers, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, no mobile phones suddenly were allowed. days before it became known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves if these officers were among the 50 per cent of the police officers who the Governor described as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had a exposé to the state expenditures concentrated on the Governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that conducted a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was given when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled all the political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were charged with high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, readers told Valdez's column as the best informed source about kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in the past we had known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slender body.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez caught a few notes and went the next morning for a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials said, based on DNA testing that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"" "journalists have become louder throughout the country, writing in organized protests" "" "SOS Press" "" "on pavements and buildings." ""</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez publicly accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked for her to be regrouped by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated its objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists were "surrounded" in Mexico by organised crime, government officials and an indifferent society.</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were infected with organised crime under a ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Last year, the "Articulo 19" media group was assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "" "" "in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," "" "said Ramirez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>

<seg id="1928">His incredibly well-preserved state has startled researchers who describe it as "really remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivorous is the best preserved fossil in its kind.</seg>

<seg id="1931">He met something out of the surrounding rock out of place, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) severe earthenware.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"" "" "" "if you blink only a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," "" "said chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen." ""</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers found that this herbivorous, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique, which is known as mating, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to better blend into its surroundings and avoid its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by large dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurier made headlines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli according to the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure by eating carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the shading - think of deer, zebras or belt-animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong beast behaviour on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur carnivores must have been the chalk time," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on clues about his life, including his conserved gut content to find out what he ate as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as south-florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much farther inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also retained in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," said Brown.</seg>

<seg id="1957">This includes the acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six ton heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists whose latest findings are published in the Current Biology trade journal believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mutated in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn funk, when he dug in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the subdued dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivorous was swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the submerging of the dinosaur kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The remains of this special specimen are preserved in such a way that the front door still cover bumpy shell plates along the dinosaur</seg>

<seg id="2001">You must also have bought it via the App of the train, the DB navigator, which is anyway the most convenient way of ticket booking.</seg>

<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or identity card or otherwise a document you have to show.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussion between train attendants and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in the control of one's own ticket and takes the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other concerns.</seg>

<seg id="2094">While the proponents insist that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, including the rest of the shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room at the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 Portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haaretz, which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year sentence after being secretly postulated diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondences between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwoman and a groundbreaking dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Through the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, Dewey-Hagborg took a sharp as well as some intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways that they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a granular, black-white selfie, in which Manning visibly sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with whom she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the big success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of forensic artefacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a portrait of a DNA.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned blouse have become unequal to those who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a "Suppressed Images" comic book by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President would transform the judgment, and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years would call for a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump puts a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new tweetable ways to keep the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said "things happen for a reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In an artistic statement written on the gallery of the gallery Manning demanded with her oversized signature (the "i" in her surname is marked with a heart) an end of "automatic fragmentation," whose basis gender, race, sexuality and culture have been. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Wey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), how astonishingly similar, at least in biological sense, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with it is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic novel.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning how she emerges from the discipline of the United States like King Kong with a hands-on phone.</seg>

<seg id="2155">This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, up to size (5 "2, Manning stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to compete at your e-commerce start-up with your employees, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not believe the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"" "" "" "there was simply no consistency and objectivity," "" "said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Association Madison Reed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2208">She called people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources Start-up Race is the best way to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">Through the creation and licensing of software, which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, provide staff anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to circumvent the C-suite managers and to turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for pursuing your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said she has gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys from specific teams, it provides a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can drill down why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they need to remain at the forefront of workplace culture so that you will not be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken were punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation and compliance sector could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020 after the Let's Talk Payments website.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Cent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">He recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, Convergence lets companies send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, gather confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main business leader is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has captured regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company finds its employees badly treated or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, "said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites, has deployed Conversible for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the discomfort of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company uses Conversible, problems that previously were hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed more quickly, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internship.</seg>

<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convergence offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that will support Venture Capital investors who have supported both startups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">In February, Convergence received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the total capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glittering guaranteed $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that is their voices, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Conversible and Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach Rendites when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">When the third-party analytics tools promise to raise commitment and commitment to employees, it's no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data about employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it can have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come fast enough, or not at all, it can grow disappointments and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have 4,000 talks," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data." ""</seg>

<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported about Glint, says Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after receiving feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company has always gained new insights into the workforce and hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better bond of workers in a sector that is known for a high turnover.</seg>

<seg id="2347">Since the failed coup, President Erdogan 169 has fired 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile-preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as the clincher of the coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="2373">Ministry wants to rehabilitate circuit for road platform shuttle</seg>
<seg id="2374">Over and over the past few months we have been arguing about the future of the racing shuttle - now it's going to be quite fast.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Even before the end of the year, on the ailing trail, on which the tourist train departs, is to be built.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the circuit breakage in the long term, construction works are expected to commence this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to further order and rehabilitate the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country is committed to this important connection, especially for tourism," declared Minister of Transport Klaus Kinsey on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The costs for the repair of the route amounted to about 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">From this sum, the country exceeds 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The agreement, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future, is currently finalised, explained atoning.</seg>
<seg id="2381">The Ministry and the South Thuringian rail as operators are already in agreement with the technical details.</seg>
<seg id="2382">"" "" "" "with this, the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are traded," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2383">The proposed agreement between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of 11 years.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This means that the racing bike shuttle should be ordered regular on December 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The track shuttle is a popular rail link between Ilmenau and Rennsteig railway stations.</seg>
<seg id="2386">In the course of a pilot operation, in the past few months, it has been tested whether the route is being used by enough people to order them regularly in the future.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought that 2017 may not be even more crazier, a new report comes about the technological developments in the area of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are a big thing at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," "" "Mr Sharkey said in the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are reached by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can "adapt" his robot according to his convictions and select everything from the eye colour of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it is still more disturbing since many robots have the "personages" that would make a stepford woman look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy gold sex robot developed by True Companion with preprogrammed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of timidity and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," enthuses the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">She also has her moods in the course of the day - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it can be tired, fixed to conversation or it can be" "" "in mood" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one approaches a step at Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" "" "it says on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something dark and deeper in our culture, towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR noted their growing popularity, they still remain on the brink of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what transpired from the fringes can be very instructive with regard to the spirit of the time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time in which the rights of women worldwide are threatened, in which there is a president in the White House who has brazed women to have been sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the intricate body and the stochian eyes, but how realistically this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as possible (even with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, brought to the point when it comes to their "personages," the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the 2017 Redemption: maid Task</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a trump-wisdom of the Trump-era that the political divisions that polarized the US voters have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-selecting relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all restrain all of us to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-headed poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House anyone who knows them, including the republican kinship, with whom she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and completely on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it is obvious to me that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the escaping effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the spooky possibility that one day his kittens will no longer repel us.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario, normalized in the Trump Republican of the Right Wing, which suddenly appears as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I think of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the mad man - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both of which are in fact a very mild offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the republicans must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York park's carousel, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are cramped and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climatising music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city won't do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Themes-Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, as here two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40's can go to it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily nobody asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, this week I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I was able to pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same plus the option to pay the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood apologetically grinsing while I tired the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of cuts in his wrists, which he reportedly suffered from the prison authorities in a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">He was sentenced for murder following an appeal by the prosecutors against a first murder sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013, firing it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nighttime intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to appeal this time to the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appeal, from which they say they are too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "the National Prosecution said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Urban Development Champion, will retire next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The job is already advertised - however, suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And his work is still a lot of fun, as he mediates in the press conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, he is surprised that no application has so far fulfilled the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">Thus, while respecting the regular periods of notice, there should be enough time for familiarisation.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach works for the administrative community as a lower building authority, the applicant has to present appropriate conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If they can't fill them anymore, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the closeness to the citizen is important to the city and to him, says Wacker, who reports from a good working atmosphere and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2556">"" "" "" "you can move a lot," "" "said Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors." ""</seg>
<seg id="2557">As the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye for what will fit in" when new buildings are approved, emphasises the outgoing urban design master.</seg>
<seg id="2558">The mayor of the city is responsible anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2559">"" "he is builder," "" "in the end everything runs here over my table." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study says exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting approximately 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to ease their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The senior researcher, Dr Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the gut are patrolling to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to cause inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far towards inflammation, it may result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it was found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus fosters when the same system also swirls in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigates a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was stored separately, had not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">She presumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice of mice were sequenced and six bacterial species found in mice with immune cells were found, but lacking them in mice.</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The Connecticut helicopter was issued next to a Maine Yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi fork lift.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House military office requested the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the Commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his supervisor, the deputy commander of the naval aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The news showed that on July 17th the helicopter arrived at 7 o'clock in the morning at the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. and so long remained until the grass was vacated between 18: 00 and 21: 00.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew for the return flight would be required due to the limitation of the service hours.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter, while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="2724">The recordings made by TIME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.</seg>

<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not have budget labels for the Presidential Flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>

<seg id="2745">Records of unit list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>

<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not retire from the persecution of Neymar after giving an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record attack?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After finishing Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the most paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan vestibule insists that the club always gave its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned of the PSG president three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City was interested in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I am not concerned because they know that when they touch one of our players, we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen Report relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the misuse cases relieves pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann says.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weizder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are church," declared after publication in front of the German press agency, he received an apology from the former Chief Apostle Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the papal Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger express deep regrets over their own omissions or their then false appraisal of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican paper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "on the other hand criticised that reporting on domestic violence was measured with" "" "two measures" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, nobody doubts that it is "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the author Lucetta Scardoia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of denying the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scardoia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">In an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk, Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said: "we like to go to the church and this is a found fresco."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "blows" "" "had been a normal pedagogical instrument," "" "to cope with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It would be unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the misuse cases, Fr. Georg Ratzinger often also appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann says, who wrote with Ratzinger the memory of "My brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber asked by the bishopric of Regensburg with the Enlightenment?</seg>
<seg id="2904">Between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen (Domspatzen) were victims of aggression between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, 67 domsparrows sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be noted that R. in many cases were used forms of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in case of high emotional appeal, the punishment for the students could also be more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">However, in contrast to numerous other accusations, many victims estimate the common humanity of R., and therefore, in many cases, even bring positive memories to him despite violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hessemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger feels relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the alleged incidents of perpetrators of violence in the Regensburger Domspatzen, "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "on the one hand, many students emphasize his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who became more tangible to the latter if a dominating kit didn't bring top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as your biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been dedicated to eight sides and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or co-knowing in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the preschool also occurred outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best, one can reproach it, learn from it too late, or have taken first indications not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the gymnasium gymnasium on which he worked was perceived as" "" "salvation" "", "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">So the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger expresses an excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "competent" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teachers, who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always surrounded by the grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained of his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to acute outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not just knead with chairs and threw the key ring on the ground, but also distributed earphones and too freaky guys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologised for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the era of questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what this report actually deals with, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the pre-school, these are certainly dreadels.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it has to do with his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just crashed on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian pope, many who never understood him are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report is relieved by Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report, a great deal was reported in the media about abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is it possible for Georg Ratzinger to carry out any involvement or co-operation with regard to sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have committed themselves to the cathedral kapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "" "said one affected representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the explanation of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even confide to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">What is the role of Ratzinger's domicile students in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely realizations and would have been able to stop the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that counting on it... booths have opened more insistently or more clearly or sooner rather than their parents, dormitory managers, trustworthy teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "it could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to link his good name with these distressing crimes, as happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media a lot of" "" "violence exits" "" "were to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed up to a huge number of sexual abuse and nonviolence and somewhere, right in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is exactly the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is, namely, cleanly separated: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and nonviolence as well, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades where Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the dome-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the terrible review pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were literally harassed and abducted, took their place at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where there were really scandalous conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got to face the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on this, as most witnesses emphasize, the theme" "" "primary school" "" "taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed such a much better treatment and for many even paradises.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What else was there in the gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">This also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that "many victims estimate the common humanity of R., and therefore, in many cases, even bring positive memories to him despite violence."</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most the accused remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and of the events at a school where he didn't work and was responsible, (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then back in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Does Georg Ratzinger consistently protect the ears from the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the gymnasium gymnasium, which even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this point he points out," "" "that in the preschool the punishment may continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, as testing punishments were also banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they occurred in a legal grey area, as each of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult to estimate the extent to which those affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where the permitted limit was really exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one cannot say that he had always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the punishment of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards on that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "we historians are talking about the" "" "pitfalls of anachronism" "", "meaning the danger of judging the past in today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was disgusting at all times and also not for what was breached in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">It's all awful and I'm glad that it will finally work.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must protect Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, such as slaying the ears and the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then banned, he has also kept strict adherence to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his Regensburg Conference did Georg Ratzinger play in the conversations with you for the book" "" "My Brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject test drive apply to speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not at all admit that he carried out a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world drank, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, one does not once again make a great singer and stand before every success, no matter in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you experience as Georg Ratzinger during the conversations with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I met Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, humorous, deeply believable and affectionate people, from whom one cannot imagine that he could also do something in a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in touch with him, like many former Domspans today, 23 years after his deportation, regularly contact him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him until this day, that he was once stern to them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspans are thankful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, father-friendly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a loving respect for which they still look and worship them downright.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again quite clear: all that is presented to him are educational methods that were on the order of the day at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it's highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a media scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that stands behind it, all too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that was published is relieved of him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the state would command, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
