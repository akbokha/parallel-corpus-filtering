28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said that he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went uphill again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided the court @-@ medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , shared the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco with that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , caught his dream job as a cook in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss it pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank initially lived in Host@@ els , but that &quot; things went up for him at last . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly man with a great heart .
to combine his way with his family was to cook us a bit , to prepare dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia .
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything going wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond shining brigh@@ tly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the information on the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I will always be put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made Hollywood star unmistak@@ ably clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always be put in drawers or get stuck from outside labels that have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be honest , these things are more likely to me . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered as &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as stated in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , in front of the TV with a lo@@ cker@@ el de@@ bris and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine .
for white gl@@ ut , she asked the children &apos;s wish : &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; said the Hollywood star .
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs from 25th August onwards .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the World Py@@ ramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger visited with some colleagues a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their work , they drove home to the feeding trou@@ ghs in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
a kilometer at that pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it wasn &apos;t a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and with that the riding career ended again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer from all time - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses .
he let himself lead with his family over the complex of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even bo@@ p for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and with it at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sporting event handed over the Golden Sports Pyrami@@ ds to the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala .
there is no lack of acc@@ ol@@ ades to the sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic ath@@ lete .
Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , Silver lau@@ rel leaf , champion @-@ tour @-@ player of the year ...
even the British Queen had already ad@@ ored him .
the 18th winner of the sports pyramid is long .
in Aachen on Saturday he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because she is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring .
and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performers include the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the former Tur@@ ner Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the rider Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the show stadium , where the Lav@@ azza prize went .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger was far from the big animals .
Clinton and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy in Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two U.S. pres@@ idents are not one in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are a fundamental philosophical distinction .
on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubt small in doubt and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he himself would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will mas@@ sively back regul@@ ators , and he is making himself strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state has to fulfil certain tasks , it has opportunities to open and needs money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , taxes would increase for the rich , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
in that must be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost iden@@ tically .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state @-@ critical tea party of the Republi@@ cans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , on Tr@@ ump , internal discussions might still be possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policies are more evident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and restart coal mining in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris climate protection treaty wants to announce it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend the renewable energies with its investment program and calls for : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ fic trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - just to better protect American jobs .
they should be paid better , rather calls Clinton .
the current minimum wage of US $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger strike .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage does not have to be changed , he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the taxation policy of the two camps .
on the one hand stands Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics argue that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is a part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing themselves .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen four women are sitting .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arm .
he gaz@@ es curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is watched .
she s@@ miles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
talking to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals among other things with women on the flight .
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ owl .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few decentr@@ alised accommodations for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs joined Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them as hope carriers to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many secretly steal away from seeing no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , murder , slavery , or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the escape , this goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tu@@ gs , for example , demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who believe that as soon as they arrive in Germany , they are mistaken , telling B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ used at worst .
this means that around 90 percent of women living in the housing in the north of Munich are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children certainly did not come up voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so used to say that they don &apos;t say anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about what was experienced , because shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they often don &apos;t know how to help , it needs more accommodations only for them , B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven District Govern@@ ments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
some with no answer to the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich within their jurisdiction .
in Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia there is something like that in front of governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone fle@@ dged women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia there are in some communal @-@ shel@@ ters floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are har@@ ness@@ ed separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or will men and women stay together , it can become - perpet@@ ual violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is available in the study .
how much the women feel this need for protection can be read by the urge to access the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we &apos;ve talked about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
assistant physicians argue : demands for new job fight measures
assistant physicians have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new work campaigns in their dispute with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work campaign measures from the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC concluded that it would have been ministers to respond to concerns about the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in July , assistant physicians and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained &quot; persist@@ ently quiet , &quot; which led to the rejection of the Treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and call for formal new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the government &apos;s silence , the J@@ DC Executive Board today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating working campaigns that began at the beginning of September .
the disputes caused assistants to strike six times this year , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , Head of B@@ MA Assistant Doc@@ tors , res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed conditions recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the sessions that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 practitioners and medical students , that the contract would be beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for physicians in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opposite player in the gold @-@ plated hall of the St. Petersburg palace , I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile appeared to be sul@@ lied , and he barely eman@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan however spoke again of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report a whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved like nothing bad happened .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite .
but a sustainable cows eman@@ ating from Putin showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the firing of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was fur@@ ious .
Putin ex@@ po@@ unded and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia .
the crime was even greater , because it was committed by a supposed friend .
re@@ building the ve@@ to is difficult , if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media launched a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
the most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria , which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting was only held because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan , who he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a cease @-@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan is primarily needed all the friends he can get after he has been reli@@ eved of his office last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken it .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght on the Mediterranean .
this week the state television forec@@ asted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports were allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ dem@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West , as it regards its response to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment on the slu@@ g pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin is coming - the pi@@ ke is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship with the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state won in Ankara with security a bonus that he demanded assistance for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow that has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this glorious palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; when an analy@@ st once described me : two countries which viol@@ ate themselves from the West and feel badly treated and now unite .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played the role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents have said at the press conference that they hadn &apos;t even stri@@ pped the issue .
the President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and considering the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State talk at least once more .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside of Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , R@@ BS should only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan informed the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself from being almost collap@@ sed and res@@ cu@@ ed eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this period , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ end consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to focus more national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the distributed head office and the listing of stock exchange to Nat@@ West will change .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private clients that will gain more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I say that we do not pursue global objectives , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own congregations for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer be able to continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of brands , because how do we concentrate inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , focusing on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these marks again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieves its 3.@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market at Pre@@ dil@@ ection
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,000 prize money
on Friday , Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British profit at New@@ market .
he put a milestone on the pre@@ dil@@ ection , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth Jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who before won G@@ ha@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the che@@ ering when he pi@@ cks victory on dil@@ ection
two jo@@ ck@@ eys hit the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a rec@@ ord@@ able career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career games
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a have enth@@ used fans for years for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already collected 6,000 winn@@ ings if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already suffered from nearly 30 years winners in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
flying Fin@@ ishes on Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of large @-@ scale tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Si@@ eben &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a ban on drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago he had difficulties when he returned from his six month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and return to his best form .
and he hasn &apos;t come to an end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue at competitions right up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten .
Russian Putin firing Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
for many years , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the tigh@@ test confidence circle of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ entative for Environmental and Transportation Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of the Krem@@ lin it is said that without stating reasons , Putin has ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been Deputy Director since 2012 , has been appointed as his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated in the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he was later the chief of the cler@@ ks and staff of the government personnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convincing the smiling faces ?
this step has taken Moscow away from secret .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ d@@ ants for a long time and worked like him for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff withdraw@@ s at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was adverti@@ sed as a potential president , at once would like to derive the Russian environmental policy - came across great skep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin cited on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to entr@@ ust the contempl@@ ative post for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , former member of the State Security Service , K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was the president of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov one of five people whom he trusted the most .
once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , as a third presidential term had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close ally of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president again three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he beat producer
Gib@@ son participated in a physical confrontation on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced his dis@@ miss@@ al in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotel chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al .
on the set there were artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which follows a team of FB@@ I agents , is expected to be published according to the statement of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios at a later date .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hoped to be there until the end , but this will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you could wish for a series .
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth season will be scheduled for 28th September .
ri@@ ddle around fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
one inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that there could be 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale , which were picked up by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ ka Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North @-@ deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings to the vi@@ a@@ duct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are approaching completion in order to reach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 obli@@ que ropes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economic Affairs Kei@@ th Brown today visited the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witness of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , completion of the closure between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete shot for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , Project Leader of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first shutter represents a significant milestone in every bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ looking high @-@ end and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the tower on the north , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the land@@ side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive , since the vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs approx . 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx . 3 % .
unc@@ le , because the tolerances on which the team worked are tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ metres .
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lucky enough to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown out of their fishing boat at Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who have been thrown into the water are un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boot engine had an emergency stop , but it loos@@ ened when the boat was boar@@ ded by the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone has wo@@ ken up today about these men .

who will build cheap apartments from Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors should be put into duty much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,@@ 300 inexpensive apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD will propose an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; room for action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next meeting session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but contro@@ versy is programmed .
first of all , the question is : who should build the cheap apartments ?
so far , a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to build on urban areas , you will have to pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the favorable apartments can , however , also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the main conflict in the town hall is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said viol@@ a : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private land ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build on such surfaces at least 10 percent , but preferably 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing development funding program , which will cost millions and still has to be financed , should provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , says viol@@ a : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left wants even tough@@ er requirements for investors .
despite this , viol@@ a , a tigh@@ tening of the situation occurs in the housing market .
if the scope of action is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is required .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the programme is not yet complete : the 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how is the loss of further approximately 1300 cheap apartments , whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokesperson , Nicole Palm , should now be bought out of the city .
in addition , it would have to be considered to bring apartments back to the price bond .
this is possible in the Western city .
the problem could be solved at one stroke .
because in the western part of the year , dead@@ lines run out at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price bond for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , the housing associations .
since the number of social housing in the West City is dras@@ tically increased , the aim of so @-@ called mixing is to be removed .
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will be even more movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D President Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although I am concentr@@ ating on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children don &apos;t go outside to play but rather prefer to spend their free time star@@ ing on screens has been su@@ ed by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon go is about getting people from the sofa and making them more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then video games and most recently on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later created a series of animation , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many phenom@@ en@@ ons of pop culture , interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined in early July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the server over@@ loaded .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( using a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the tur@@ key and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person withdraw@@ s every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which followed 35@@ ,000 users , informed the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of night @-@ out people , who exercise every day 30 minutes , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns to promote health that people want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are d@@ ull to health and come from people who look mis@@ erable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ rated .
those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here .
but the miracle of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even make new friend@@ ships .
as always , there are also gru@@ es@@ ome playing per@@ ish@@ ers , who always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what is it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough happened .
even though smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will fade away with time .
due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the women &apos;s urn
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant all along the line .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday promoted the title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly before the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team amer@@ adi@@ n A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alli@@ st Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa .
the American female Sim@@ one Bil@@ es runs on the balance beam during the single multi @-@ fight arena of women in gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ it is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi @-@ fight title , winning the fifth as she consoli@@ dates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey had ended at that moment .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated her sport for the past three years - including 10 gold med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with such amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said she &apos;s &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was expecting a final examination in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as dis@@ appointment .
the American female Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ fight arena of women at the Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ a got the first medal on Tuesday , while on the f@@ arewell party , the retirement of the team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as a sign of ex@@ clamation .
although Bil@@ it insist@@ ed that , during its long path to the top , never to have the future planned , it is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gymn@@ asi@@ um , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man .
since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no more competition , a winning stre@@ ak , which will last as long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ afa was slightly deceived by two turns , the image dec@@ ei@@ ves .
balance bars and ground belts - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - loud .
she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the balance beam - and took another 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently when she expected her death - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured out on Bil@@ es brilliant red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
Ra@@ is@@ mans &apos; performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when fighting for third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ afa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their practice , she threw K@@ us@@ h@@ ems to the public , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly expanding T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a whole new meaning from the very beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims killed in mass kill@@ ings when listening to music in the car
according to police reports released on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl killed in one of the most le@@ thal attacks in the first serial killer of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a gun while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , to read in the report .
the police informed that the triple murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , because the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
Phoenix S@@ gt@@ . Jonathan Howard said the shooting caused the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks during four months and two others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard der K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ an from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n .
investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the ground .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the firing squ@@ aring on an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and that it was assumed that it was the factory of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ al sleeves and secured a sphere from the seat as well as spher@@ ical fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but just like the f@@ ew@@ est of his elderly people Ed@@ mund has micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was that I couldn &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t create that .
I didn &apos;t let myself go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course you have let yourself go on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her were told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people are still doing &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund wasn &apos;t able to sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year of age and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund has de@@ vised for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are bringing sign language to him , &quot; says Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented several characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic like with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary widely .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly wonder@@ ed what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for a pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect them to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
they know it will get better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the Gover@@ nor to call the emergency stand on Friday . it is expected all Saturday with more rainf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River flooded its banks and threatened large @-@ scale floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa alone demanded tens of thousands of sand bags .
a flood warning system is used over large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service provided that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was deployed on Friday , while it continued to rain in the mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will most likely reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood into the area opposite Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these rivers are slowly flowing into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as via the tro@@ dden rivers .
the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w river , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest status on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , ever recorded .
rescue teams still le@@ aded people out of flood waters in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed by the monastery on Friday .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from its home , rose strongly overnight .
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flo@@ ated and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife H@@ ans@@ ford said that she had never seen such a high level of flux in the 48 years in which she lived there .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that emergency gri@@ ppers had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ be , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had spread rapidly , as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered ev@@ ac@@ uation operations .
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer mar@@ ched near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the rain has been considerably delayed by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities pointed out that heavy ra@@ ins and street floods caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and school trips in five school districts .
the WW@@ L C@@ BS subsidiary reported that there were 200 flooded houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , which now both were flooded .
the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets , washed up by floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to house the ev@@ acu@@ ees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed due to floo@@ ding and sand bags provided for the residents , hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last great floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to become a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses were reported to be reported on Thursday as flooded , but on Friday were not reported until now .
Kei@@ th Tow@@ n@@ son , manager at shop@@ per value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; said Tow@@ n@@ son , &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; lost by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police announced that the six @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified it for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents admitted that Brown suffered multiple shot injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital during his transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body was pun@@ ched by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter that he is expected to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people shooting in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot dead , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently there had been a bon@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
pat@@ ron@@ y@@ how@@ s for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to various storm @-@ guns , over@@ looked the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly a continuing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were po@@ ds .
thus , there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; said police officers Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter .
there were also several houses and vehicles hit in the area .
there were no ar@@ rests and the police are currently checking the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cri@@ mp on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lan@@ e .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
first of all I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and second , this team has three gymn@@ asts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls from other skin colors .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catholic is , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one of female gymn@@ asts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman .
last year were Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
that shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas proved to be a surprise Olympic med@@ alist and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful Gy@@ mas@@ tics routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold for an individual multi @-@ campaign event .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but this is not what gymn@@ as@@ tics in the whole country do not look like .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie hit everyone in the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison in order to get it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four gymn@@ asts in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner primarily in private gymn@@ as@@ tics , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , education , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for coaches and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . the list can be continued arbitr@@ arily .
the majority of these sports clubs lie in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both athletes since they started gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to give the congregations an inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls , inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , to offer a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ reach gym .
I founded my gymn@@ as@@ tics of 20 years .
at my events we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban teenagers ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth of high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to care for the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such a thrilling time .
thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gold and thank you for motiv@@ ating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way of becoming healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant physicians would like to organise other strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance doctors who voted to vote refused him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July , Hun@@ t plans to introduce the treaty by forci@@ bly introducing the treaty and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to the employees and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first resident doctors are to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend endar@@ s in order to improve the care for un@@ complicated hours .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chair of B@@ MA Kom@@ m@@ ee for assistance doctors said last night in a message with : &quot; assistants have still serious concerns about the proposed deal , in particular that it will fuel the current crisis of the workforce and to treat it to all physicians . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and time runs out .
efforts on the part of the B@@ MA to resolve disputes caused by discussions were to take part in the government on reluc@@ tance and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this happened to a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had only made last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the condition and address the concerns of the assistance doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the assistants have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work procedures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 schedules , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on strike post@@ cards .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the Re@@ formed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA wants to offer a better weekend pay for the 5@@ 4.000 practitioners who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of N@@ HS Emplo@@ ye@@ es , urged the assistance doctors to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action measures achieve nothing but little , but pol@@ lu@@ te already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , car@@ ers and their families only wor@@ rying , need and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last two months we talked to the committee of the assistance doctors and had responded positively to the concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ing with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
the employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , continuing education and the health ministry in respect of adher@@ ence to agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per Tag@@ - drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti @-@ inflammatory drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , which reduces the risk of stroke or further heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulation body recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulation body recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form plaque .
when the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing the flow of blood to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
when the blood c@@ lot triggers , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another heart attack .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more impro@@ b@@ able .
the draft of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Care Evaluation Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have considerable adverse effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
by suggest@@ ing T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or &apos;s draft recommendation , we are pleased to be able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness culture blos@@ som@@ ed in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year due to corruption from office
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a culture of political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread voting in Muslim communities such as a devastating government report today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and town halls to ignore the evidence of mis@@ use due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government , who is now a pro @-@ corruption king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police were allowed to set up shut @-@ off tapes outside of voting boo@@ ths to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
he recommends that voters should have an ID card to prove their identity in elections .
at present , a vot@@ er merely needs to name his name and address .
the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink to a person &apos;s finger if they leave their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for election fraud but also to protect the communal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that goes hand in hand with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s Choice circle in the east of London .
last year , a special selection court ruled that the reign@@ ing mayor of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia alleg@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the ground that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of im@@ itation in which a person chooses as someone else .
Sir Eric said that there is evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he expressed particularly alar@@ ming on the dec@@ ep@@ tive letter of letters - the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including conducting ID to prove the identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; As proof it was appropriate that pressure was exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elders , especially communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been concerns that ... State institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such a behaviour on the basis of &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists edit let@@ ter@@ ers to stop &quot; harv@@ ests . &quot;
the report considered by Ther@@ esa May also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social fraud .
consider options to ask voters before choosing according to your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
systematic reviews on the nationality of a person carry out to ensure they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation to requests for an automatic letter of letters .
ban that political activists edit full letter elections and envel@@ opes of let@@ ter@@ sel@@ ections .
the police have the authority to set up shut @-@ off for election stations .
a change of legislation that facilit@@ ated an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the Act 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act ( 1983 ) .
photograph@@ ing prohibited in election stations .
requirement that only English must be used in the election stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training in order to ensure that the staff generally en@@ force that voters go into the elec@@ tive cabin on their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case no criminal complaint was placed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his substitute for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements of the criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; ha@@ k@@ holes &quot; of the election registration departments of the town halls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country is a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games will be amazed by French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , who has proved to be an impressive double @-@ go@@ ver of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic gymn@@ as@@ tics is by no means the only one fighting ath@@ lete who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if you can believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that currently fli@@ cker on our screens , F@@ email has created lists of Olympi@@ ans who have more than a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the cycling track , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain arch@@ ery of the twin from A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street star mysteri@@ ously similarly .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard since childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I see no great simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy told the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I guess it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly highlight this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British female jum@@ per Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa with her big expressive eyes will be able to go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one gear higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another ongoing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nice who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver med@@ al@@ lion Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va features more than just sun@@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
put theory into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the gymn@@ as@@ tics Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games exc@@ laim@@ s for his statement that Chinese &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; swi@@ mmer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis of the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m free @-@ style swimming @-@ monkey indign@@ ant viewers of the C@@ BC live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical games on Wednesday
Canadian broad@@ ca@@ ster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese flo@@ ater went &quot; like sum@@ mits &quot; and during the race , like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he left his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free @-@ style swimming pool .
Mac@@ Donald , who was brought aboard the C@@ BS commentary team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be said : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the union , baby . &quot;
too excited , as M@@ ief , he died like a pig .
thank you for it .
the Chinese flo@@ ater Ai Yan@@ an , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the flo@@ ats 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed Can@@ adi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
viewers across Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and language .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not capture that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ an from China was described as follows in the final 4 x 200m free @-@ style swimming spot for women : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism of By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came fast and hard , in which many presented him .
Twitter users were not back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald was
another Twitter user Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us look like ra@@ cists . # disgu@@ sted .
shortly after , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comment , said : &quot; we are sorry that the comment has been broadcast over a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times in the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ kt on Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to over 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on the show and our followers in the social media .
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ ons comments referred to the performance of the float and not to them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation . By@@ ron does very sorry for what he said .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Flo@@ od in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ is@@ mailing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I focused on the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on her as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was inten@@ tional and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark is ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the middle of the business
the buyers did not know where to look , when a woman moved her clothes in the middle of a mar@@ row to try under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked as she looked at it , pulled it off and put it back to the shelf .
she continued to rum@@ mage and ta@@ sted four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark business at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone in which the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put it back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she re@@ treated and the business left without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales floor she took a pair of under@@ pants from the out@@ lay , pulled out her own trousers and trousers and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the pants that you obviously did not like , because she put her back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three more under@@ pants before she finally decided that she liked nothing , re@@ treated and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to bo@@ ther anyone watching - or thinking about the person who might buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Davi@@ dson , 33 living in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how hard to think that someone would take homes with someone who had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I received , the staff tried to pull the clothes out of sale after they went , which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman she had and pulled out and did not wash them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday , 9th August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself from weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com might make it a bit safer for you .
we spoke with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer up for your rob@@ ber .
when you approach you from behind , you should turn around first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and move out of the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
then hit him with the knee into the bar and twist while the aggres@@ sor cro@@ oked before pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while they direct the weapon to him .
for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er can not shoot .
shift the weight on your gun at the same time and hit the aggres@@ sor on your chest , then twist the gun from its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master , it is the saf@@ est thing to over@@ haul your money .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British travel@@ er sub@@ du@@ ed his immune system and the dignity of a serious test by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ ook his course on a Euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a push button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before checking each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and show us what he is going to do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brought some surprising results to light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of det@@ ecting a wash@@ basin that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey across Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical experts about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health .
fortunately , nothing he le@@ aked left more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ings to stations to dish@@ washing of toilets , the job posed its immune system definitely among a sample
in the film he told me : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he was justified in any case .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its test sample showed a lumin@@ ance of over 4000 units .
in comparison to this , the lumin@@ ance number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet he refused to refuse after their L@@ umin@@ ometer number was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; showing the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst thing I have done in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I will not check here because it is disgu@@ sting inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New Categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended with saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom H@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I had told him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to introduce Ian to them and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associated with lac@@ tic acid bacteria especially with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing attached lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ cial family destroyed prior to del@@ aying social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social housing after a del@@ u@@ ge with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terrori@@ zed her neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ oba were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after forci@@ bly removed from their property , shock@@ ing employees of the housing cooperative found their property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state .
the walls had g@@ aping holes , wooden floor boards were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated on the walls .
the family was res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for home administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who were living in the apartment in the meantime and the police said the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ ams , stri@@ kers and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , received an order for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house , which will be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the property in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wood boards were torn
neighbours reported that they had to fight them on the street and regularly called the police .
she and her partner forced Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing forci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ cation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years apart from them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
now that they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood Enfor@@ cement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it had ab@@ used the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , for 20 years
rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the church building
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the les@@ see would agree to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family as a del@@ u@@ ge is always the last step taken into consideration Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their actions for their neighbors had to be terri@@ bly involved .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and gave us the information .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the deletion on the ground
workers of the house management will now have to clean up garbage mountains , which surround the house
in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found about 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine after she had become guilty of the ownership of a class B drug in commercial sight .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in 2013 in a car accident .
after they were homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many of the house walls were covered with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police are saying that they will del@@ ve ten@@ ants who do not abide by the house rules
Angela C@@ row by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall shared with the fact that del@@ u@@ ating was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not conform to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self @-@ reproach and those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

the air forces indicated that it was on a training flight , but insist@@ ed that there was no security risk
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an eff@@ emin@@ ate jet was crashing down a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers j@@ umped up when they were understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the nozzle works without first seeing what came through the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many tourists who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane fell down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were stag@@ gering in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deeply
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fis@@ her boats off the coast and thus had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said the jet was flying somewhat deeper than usual due to the bad visibility caused by the nearby area fires , but the air forces insist@@ ed that safety at no time was at risk .
surface fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people on the island Madeira were also killed .
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot was forced to fly so deeply due to the circumstances - strong fog and smoke ;
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup against the FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash increases three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ w@@ inner must ren@@ ounce in the balance of power with the under@@ stated Cup@@ fin@@ alist and reign@@ ing Europa League Champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
also , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen is missing .
the German suffered a slight change in the knee in the training , which clari@@ fied the demand for Bar@@ ca at least for the time being in favor of Claudio bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen were competing in Barcelona for two years as number one .
so far , Coach Luis En@@ rique wai@@ ved a clear decision in this respect and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the rest of the competition had the advantage .
before the first compulsory game of the new season , the Spanish master doubts about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. really did not really convince at the 3 : 2 in the pro@@ lo@@ p of S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday .
Sev@@ ille , again , has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super Cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;

Ma Long in an own league to match table tennis
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and title defender , Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
thus the world @-@ ranked first one won the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at the World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ geb@@ ob and just Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title one among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top of the Olympics was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sets and in time @-@ outs they had no coaches at them .
they had pulled back to the grand@@ stand and left their guns on top of each other in a fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have played the mats here for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang had said fol@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists were awarded with the China Flag .
the match itself was un@@ il@@ ater@@ ally one @-@ sided .
Ma had really strug@@ gled with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old ad@@ versary only in the first movement .
after that he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points .
the su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
but nevertheless there were enough breath @-@ taking ballo@@ ons to be seen .
Mi@@ zu@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had drawn a breach of ri@@ b , then in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be content with sheet metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) had become the Olympic @-@ fourth in a similarly high table tennis table .
Donald Tr@@ ump ad@@ mits dangerous &quot; problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now announced weaknesses of his campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment when the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire has expressed something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals in their own Republi@@ can camp from the race , doubts pers@@ ist in his success in the struggle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump of evangel@@ ical Christians whom he asked for assistance in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilty of false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media policy .
shake the republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Republi@@ cans .
according to a survey conducted by the Surv@@ ey@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and his rival from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , were alike .
other institutions see Tr@@ ump in the beginning , but not with the distance that can be used for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
also Arizona and Georgia are considered to be endangered .
in an interview with the CN@@ BC station , Tr@@ ump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whether afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he makes nothing else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it was not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that is fine , Tr@@ ump said .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party has threatened to raise funds to support its election campaign , it should not be able to present better poll@@ s .
instead of this , the candidates of the re@@ public@@ ans would be stronger than their arms .
Olympics : tri@@ une Sc@@ am at dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
after the second dop@@ ing affair K@@ eni@@ as athletes are threatened with the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after a fraud test in a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee immediately informed a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan official informed that the former Spr@@ inter and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch .
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF world association has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , a IA@@ AF narr@@ ator announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it stated in an IA@@ AF explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and served as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , handed over the sample and signed , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as head of mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete , who stood on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics deleg@@ ate Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed himself against cash payments sports@@ men of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested on his return to Nairobi &apos;s airport .
Kenya stands for a long time under special observation at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing contracts .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C , more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls in front of the Rio Games were usually pointed out in advance that athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted .
the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on African land before the summer Olympics , an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the beginning of the Olympics .
as a consequence , the WA@@ DA Kenya has taken on the list of countries whose dop@@ ing combat con@@ forms to the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ nation .
athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the World Cup in Beijing in 2015 .
in a series of television reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations have been repeated over and over again that dop@@ ing resources are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a substantial ment@@ ality of the sports equipment .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally called for a similar investigation into Kenya , as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
in doing so , it was possible to demonstrate that this type of sport was under@@ cut and systematically sub@@ du@@ ed .
Russian athletes were subsequently excluded from summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic few , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins &apos; masterpiece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled himself with the role of Mary as a youth dream .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchester directed by the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that she is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria in this st@@ aging .
she rec@@ alls with melanch@@ oly to her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first of all because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so it &apos;s clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is an enormous human being .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and passion@@ ately ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his looks , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ories have gone to New York and the New Yor@@ kers didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same themes , and they are as powerful today as it was back then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago , her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she pre@@ tended to leave the war @-@ exploited country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other girls from the east of London entered an airplane towards Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she had married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and she became a widow within a few months .

the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to choose Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain amount of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman by Rei@@ d later said that he had not talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he was spec@@ ulating .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not worry with a new candidate .
gar@@ land is the highest judge for the US Court of App@@ eal for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Republi@@ cans blocked gar@@ land nom@@ ination , were lack@@ eys and heroes of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants to make nude calendar for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women and for men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine co@@ operates with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to bring out a 70 @-@ year Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine of Old@@ school play@@ boys distinguishes since &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently it is the view that it does the calendar too .
&quot; we need to return to the representation of timeless and classic nu@@ dity where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release to publish the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or in person with open cast@@ ings calling in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish congregation expects mass exo@@ dus
&quot; if you don &apos;t fit and ano@@ int Erdo@@ gan , sit on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of asylum seek@@ ers to flee to Germany from Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the harsh blows of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with several hundred thousand prot@@ esters from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan government continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has already over@@ taken Kurdish bur@@ sts with sanctions a few months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing from Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the failed coup , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added .
many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes refugees itself is producing refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the commander @-@ in @-@ chief accused the deliber@@ ate settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ viol@@ a cities .
this will allow Erdo@@ gan to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been exter@@ min@@ ated or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the association called for the Federal Government to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positioned as sharply as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan @-@ critics is held . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the brand mark as a Gü@@ len fan eliminates the professional existence of teachers and other acade@@ mi@@ cians .
&quot; whoever does not adapt and ano@@ int Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the K@@ em@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ ari@@ sts , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the newspaper , with reference to figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks have already set up the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
on the reporting date June 30 , this was 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people , and thus almost 29 percent of all who recognized as asylum @-@ seek@@ ers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this elevation there are not those before war , poverty or lack of prospects .
asylum Rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from state side , individual pursu@@ ers .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; to go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia do not choose the day of the country .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
by 2021 , the Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because more stup@@ id@@ ly than hitherto it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and district heating struggle - that bit@@ es itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the election fighters , are on holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on Use@@ dom , Ru@@ egen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the day of the country .
practical problems come about : during the holidays , hel@@ pers , posters hang up , infl@@ ating ballo@@ ons , distributing fl@@ yers and counting voices , only ar@@ du@@ ed with difficulty .
by September 4 , 2016 , the election and final day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign close to the people over itself .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
exciting will be how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government for 2008 , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous campaign for election .
he travels across the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as he did his legendary word @-@ car@@ eous predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff .
apart from that , soul ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D .
her refugee policy , her &quot; We are creating , &quot; has accelerated the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry .
the CD@@ U with its leading candidate , the interior minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is if you make election campaigns at the right time at the wrong time .
she has twice invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to open @-@ air demonstrations ; Merkel &apos;s election district is located in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , general secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR .
but it is too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , co@@ king , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noted that on the land you will crum@@ ble the base that it must be very hard to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are going on like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly any in the expan@@ ses of the country .
the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ electoral campaig@@ ner Kok@@ ert on his comrades is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; you must go where it hur@@ ts , where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday celebration must be used . &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called on its SPD to a particularly committed campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats recently stood at 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just in front of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the 2011 election , the SPD gained a clear victory of 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in poll@@ s , should make the leap into parliament .
they make a modern virtue out of the necessity of holidays and largely reloc@@ ate their campaign to the Internet .
&quot; online voting campaign &quot; is called the president Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green elec@@ tives embar@@ k on a search for clu@@ es after local vocal ch@@ ords .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just cur@@ v@@ ots with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and still finds it beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 Rest@@ oration : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end only at 8 p.m. , there are all praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they made everything pretty cris@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no delay .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything will be ready .
the commen@@ cement of those responsible for construction works is also commen@@ ded , for example when it comes to the establishment of expe@@ ditions .
since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and the blocking of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was cancelled and the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg again , the traffic situation within the village has eased .
the citizens can now proceed from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the cre@@ denti@@ al traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some serious complaints , &quot; says the Deputy Head of Sales , Florian King , responsible for the restructuring of the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ ing had to fight with more traffic noise because many sne@@ aks were looking for and more familiar to their Nav@@ i than the signs .
what led to some truck in residential areas was fran@@ tic .
as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality appe@@ aled the vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant exceed@@ ances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself informed about the situation himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been flas@@ hed .
the fastest was on the way at 77 km / h in the Tempo @-@ 30 @-@ Zone .
but since the construction site has moved on , it has become cal@@ mer .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a little con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the street is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B @-@ 27 @-@ refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to drop @-@ in break@@ through@@ s allows everyone to see through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; are produced for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at most moderate decline &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; also at the deal@@ er@@ ship Ma@@ ier , but also conc@@ edes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the running announcement is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bars are mostly bag@@ ged along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
that is an exist@@ ential threat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we need to be happy about every euro sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the revenue recorded increases to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road rehabilitation has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of his employees have to be released . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages inherent in the rehabilitation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other districts , where it has been handled more gener@@ ously .
in all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , he points to the long history .
he can understand that other regul@@ ars look less frequently due to complicated traffic management .
if you can &apos;t drive , it &apos;s also somewhere else beautiful .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his regular client@@ ele comes back at the end of the rehabilitation work .
despite the crises with BSE and avian flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on its client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ term history .
six months of construction work , which is already brutal .
the name of the fight against terrorism is constantly ro@@ uted to laws .
after the latest attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has an inflammatory status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say about all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the satisfaction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior concerning the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anybody .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
and I am also offen@@ ded by this .
however , as Minister of the Interior , he was determined by the results and on a &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has handed a little time to Ans@@ bach before presenting his conclusions concerning security in the Republic .
but they are all the more comprehensive .
some things have already been announced , announced , announced , that a new security agency should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
nor the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU requirements on passenger data and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising .
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is starting a second attempt for proposals which have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to provide sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and press ji@@ ha@@ dis with double citizenship the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ man ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still considers this to be reasonable and also demands nothing , which has no chance with the coalition partner anyway .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère presents some new ideas too .
some of them have in themselves : he is planning quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ achment from people before deport@@ ation .
refugees arriving in the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of divor@@ ce for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse points than previously - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to obsc@@ ure their identity .
some of these are political and judi@@ ci@@ ary .
some of them also have an un@@ obstruc@@ ted effect and leaves questions un@@ answered .
and with some points - in the im@@ balance of patient for example - the question arises : what actually does this have to do with security and terror ?
yes , say de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the kill@@ ers were refugees from Ans@@ bach and Würzburg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , many people worried about security in the face of high refugee numbers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and things that people deeply bu@@ gged down could not be compl@@ ained about in election campaigns .
the internal security has moved enormously .
first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral struggles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly gaining ground in the issue of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few days , there was a high level between the two parties .
only a gar@@ nish dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some of the Ministers of the Interior , in which the local managers also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a departure from the dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also ar@@ gues here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
from a departure from the double pass he has nothing .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ plen@@ ish it is not sensible .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
whether its own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist , must first show up .
there is a lot of things that could lead to arguments .
but the SPD is also trying to benefit from internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel first signs a cau@@ tious willingness to talk and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Volkswagen is still gli@@ ding .
in spite of diesel engines , delivery numbers are rising worldwide .
but it does not run smoothly in all markets .
in the recall action there is vor@@ tex about a term .
Volkswagen starts the second half @-@ year as a result of deliveries .
despite the diesel properties of many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to present an increase in the course of the year .
but in July VW declined princip@@ ally in Western Europe and thus again weigh@@ ed the total sales , as the company listed in the D@@ ax ha@@ st@@ ened .
at 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars worldwide , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles worldwide than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the same period of the previous year .
deliveries by Germany declined by almost one sixth .
brand name sales Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann reduced the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , a purchase reserve was given in some core markets by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on ex@@ iting from the EU also explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the USA , where the flu@@ e gas filters first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the chi@@ ef@@ ly affected family brand of Nieder@@ sachsen will continue to gli@@ de through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only an ex@@ tradition minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler continued to show a sales place from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen has been manipul@@ ating exhaust tests with a software .
in Germany alone , VW inv@@ ests some 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting to workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting VW , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars did not have any negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the conversion of the car , the car manufacturer has issued a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as was stated on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the reason for legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now providing its German customers with a guarantee for retro@@ fitted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
from the ministry of transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA fully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; states Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , according to the ministry .
VW has taken over the guarantee that , after retro@@ fitting , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power will not take place and all relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was stated in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers , for example , come into a workshop half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also in the interest of the customer it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust sc@@ andal leads to uncertainty with regard to possible warranty regulations as it was called .
therefore VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see requires extensive savings in future as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; banking manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers need not fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks deposit money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay a penalty of 0.4 percent .
this fee will be charged to Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund in September of Private and Corporate Clients for deposits above 100,000 euros on sight deposit or day money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 euros will cost 400 euros in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had been around 40 million euros for some time , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not exploit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and generate 0.4 percent of costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for each million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter pays the costs continue .
spending the cash in the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank &apos;s saf@@ es would be far too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four cases , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the bank board .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs at all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to bear it alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thur@@ in@@ gia Volks@@ ge- and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with pen@@ alties for deposits starting from three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , managing director of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay widespread fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany is much too strong for banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele which is rich@@ ly furnished by the property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she boun@@ ces for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are currently no further banks known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which calculate a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Federation of German Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , stated at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into negative towards private customers is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it is threatening the migration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany don &apos;t like this in width .

according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multilingual re@@ formation of records is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but back to mid @-@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght after between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ den by amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older turn@@ tables retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and I &apos;d say , &quot; So , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there &apos;s still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to judge their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , of Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , one woman , probably around 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I appreciate , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and re @-@ bought items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought I was probably a bit too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers , whom he meets , apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pump , people who have heard about their com@@ eback and are anxi@@ ous to buy their old records again .
from the conversations that I have led , people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to supporters of the plate revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of records ?
it takes just a few seconds in a store like F@@ oll@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z some of the older customers took off the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar sound boards , of objects that recall happy memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it may be the filling of empt@@ iness or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector so I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee flo@@ under@@ ed from a record stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not have record players .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried as I pu@@ ff through a stack of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone came up only recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record , so that I can put it on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less music @-@ class .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who come in slowly .
opp , which has dedicated the record almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists that make photos , teen@@ age boys and women middle @-@ aged .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s newest syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ ed pop instead of experimental jazz ro@@ ckets from the loudspeakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to det@@ ectable if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of sheets available for sale .
it is more of a window @-@ shopping than a big shopping .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting sheets is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in another way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I have the appearance of mu@@ stering je@@ ans hot pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls group@@ ing around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential panels for an average collection .
nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group , who has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research yiel@@ ded that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they do not take into account the large number of female collectors in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they don &apos;t spend their Thursday morning with the b@@ ump of plate shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets through plates as they avoid the star@@ ing look of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false pres@@ enter who rises above the shoulders of un@@ susp@@ ecting middle @-@ aged men .

French Court re@@ jects offer on demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle , where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 provisional stores where people inside the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell hair@@ dresser services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which contain a risk of fire and sickness .
humanitarian groups shared the dish that businesses and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also indicated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people using the 72 provisional businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely feed people who live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in extremely prec@@ arious conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet places between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the collapse was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated in a public manner and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &quot; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest are eight years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants inv@@ aded on Friday that the number of refugees living in the jungle camp was raised to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers during the summer .
despite Olympics dis@@ appointment : Martin keeps fighting
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic season , Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get his grip on .
&quot; I keep watching the World Cup at a glance , stay confident and fight on , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he has no explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar hat .
&quot; I hon@@ estly don &apos;t think it &apos;s hard to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; said Martin .
let him analyze in peace , what reasons for the de@@ bac@@ le have led .
Martin wanted to fight for the title at the World Cup in Qatar in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

group increases with start @-@ up for live video games
watching other people playing video games is a giant - this is what Microsoft wants to benefit from .
the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am , which specializes in this hobby .
Microsoft announced on Thursday how much money is flowing for the tak@@ eover .
Be@@ am went to the start with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but also interfere with yourself .
for example , they can give players missions and face enemies as well as provide equipment .
Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard is launching a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sport .
on the way to the global media event , Facebook is to help Facebook .
the advertising industry is already listening .
the start @-@ ups team , which has its headquarters in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , moved to Microsoft headquarters in the Califor@@ nian Red@@ mond , as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and CEO Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i shared .
the acquisition will therefore not be able to change anything for the customer .
according to Microsoft , Be@@ am is integrated into the video games department around the Xbox .
the market for live streaming of video games is growing rapidly .
known platforms are t@@ witch and YouTube gaming .
T@@ witch was bought by the online retail@@ er Amazon in 2014 - for nearly one billion dollars .

here comes the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers must adapt to the next generation of speed knives : in different federal states , including in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new ligh@@ tening units are being tested , which should be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler from Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accident sites where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itate bridges with temporary templates , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary flash for compliance with speed limit@@ er .
however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex .
the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days , while the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be tra@@ cked at the same time across multiple tracks .
variable speed limits as well as access b@@ ans according to time , lane and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the advanced state , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer .
so that it is not simply st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and inci@@ dentally also cast @-@ resistant outer cover disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to the information provided by Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 units last year .
UK pi@@ cks silver in 7 @-@ er rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gets gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance during the 7 @-@ day rug@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt in the final on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of fi@@ j@@ is when they were beaten in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ odor@@ us Stadium .
Fi@@ ji gave a master class in handling , side @-@ stepping , back , line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour .
the defeat was lost due to the not too bad price of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji could have sm@@ itten a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it might be a con@@ sol@@ ation for UK - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a br@@ ite tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ry@@ an , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , Ry@@ an lost every game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this stage is going to hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began to surprise and let the G@@ b attacks boun@@ ce off from fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if you were running in running buses . the World Series winners walked 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au fro@@ ze around in the corner .
after four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a prot@@ rac@@ ted T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute ath@@ j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new member since the re@@ play and there was still about a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided over further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while G@@ GB is still learning .
this is how it is .
GB led basic changes to the half @-@ time and closed down the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the circumstances of the first half until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran through a brilliant inter@@ play by Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea @-@ s@@ wimm@@ ers , whose fans sang , flags sw@@ inging and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB ki@@ cked in the grass .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a tight half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown took the Bo@@ ks in the first half forward , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather Sho@@ oting inspired by the fight against the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ in@@ arian gold than with these games and that wants to be hot .
from the first ru@@ dder angle to the last 220 hard p@@ ieve , which enter history , Hel@@ en Bell and He@@ ather St@@ anning invented an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when they row@@ ed to the second Olympic champion in a second without a tax @-@ woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sports who set on such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , at least their 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ written application , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ let@@ ins gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the trium@@ ph@@ al march .
behind each gold in rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who contribute to incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and no one was more helpful than the coach who did not know if he would survive this day at all , when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ ked .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that did they .
if you do not do that , he spreads everywhere .
it would have been a rather aw@@ ful situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the interruption to a minimum if that was the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to get better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve wre@@ cking morning listening to something more than usual and trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s maybe something extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much this means to me how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
it was three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning didn &apos;t lose a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with it .
even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not sure to make something great .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race as we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week at a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have been too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary clarity provided for 31 years
the managing director of the water @-@ purpose association &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert Gö@@ ller , will reti@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern far exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water network as a model for the large water producers .
so it was said some time ago in the original sound in a contribution by the Bavarian Radio .
a little later , the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia appreciated the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller , who was 31 years in the co@@ hesi@@ on association , stands for 28 years as managing director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose @-@ association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein @-@ Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes approximately 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water each year and supplies 32 villages and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the municipalities of Kirch@@ ner , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach are member communities .
there are supply contracts for further cities and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ n Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller was hired as a water@@ shed in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very varied and they extended from the construction of water and maintenance to office and organizational activities , budget planning , fees and fees to emergency calls on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events , it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new well ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the refur@@ bish@@ ment of the high containers ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the reconstruction of water pipes .
there have never been a stand@@ still and I have always added new innovations , because water means life and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation she commen@@ ded Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose band@@ age and he lived as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group for nit@@ rate reduction before the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller on his part praised the Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best wat@@ ter and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
he described the well @-@ being and restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband as high points from his perspective .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult application were the rup@@ ture at the elevated tank at Kirch@@ ner on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
one can also only maintain the supply of brun@@ n , because one filled the high reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert Gö@@ ller .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at a multi @-@ family home in Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10 : 45 p.m. and wounded them in a deadly accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , after him I will be publicly prosec@@ uted .
meanwhile nationwide because Sven S. could travel by car .
the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
it is , however , a few years old .
meanwhile the man is wearing a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could carry the weapon with him , so the police .
those who see Sven S. want to call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship at nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator in 1981 .
in the first place , the police in Lü@@ beck wanted to make no statements about the Ta@@ ther@@ ing or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; however , it confirmed that a human being was killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a Special Operations Command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions .
financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity extraction are from the table .
the German Steel Industry , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , the Minister of Economic Affairs , said the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened with an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z that there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Com@@ miss@@ ar Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent applies .
but even this will not be le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for its own electricity generation .
as a result , the status quo of the previous regulation is mostly pre @-@ recorded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have particular significance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is Future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and substantial price pressure .
last year , the situation continued to exac@@ erb@@ ate the situation when the world &apos;s largest producer of products made massive steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers are throwing Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has eased a little .
on the one hand , tra@@ cked import duties on import ste@@ els have an impact , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have brigh@@ tened .
it is unclear how sustainable the price collection is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least the prices would have stagn@@ ated again .
the sector respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works at the end .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel manufacturers are cau@@ tious .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the same period of the previous year , as the Wirtschafts@@ vereinigung Stahl announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May the produced volume went back the second month in a row .
production has been around two percent lower than the previous year &apos;s figure since the beginning of the year .
the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output in the coming months .
community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors well
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal she feels balanced , cheerful and more lively , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and spirit .
because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German Seni@@ or@@ en@@ li@@ ga .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular meetings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and cultivate social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organise , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for this , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand their lungs get out of the powder in everyday life as well .
even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursul@@ a L@@ enz from the Federal Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens &quot; Organis@@ ations .
in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , it explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people ar@@ ouses a lot of memories , often connected with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies self @-@ dementia suffer@@ ers are dec@@ lining for long past events .
in singing , a special performance is required for the head , L@@ enz explains .
focusing simultaneously on one &apos;s own voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
just elderly people who live alone practice not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the feeling of self @-@ esteem increases through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time for something , I get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
there are good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
if you want to try a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate , even if you think you have little talent , L@@ enz betra@@ ys .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when a note goes next to it ?
looking for the right offer sen@@ iors have various options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a retirement home , one can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly .
many senior choirs can also be found via the Internet .
those who do not have access to the Internet can ask family , friends or neighbors for help with internet research .
if you want to sing , you should necessarily join a choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul good and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react more sensitive than han@@ go@@ vers at cri@@ es of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover which effect is the calling of cat babies to adult animals .
to her surprise , also the males did not let the males get cold - however they beha@@ ved always the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of reg@@ ression of cat babies at the mi@@ ch@@ ewing of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to caus@@ tic kit@@ ten , which are in great need as scientists from the Veter@@ inary College and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) found out .
males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; evi@@ dently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ thing of less and strongly excited young animals for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of significance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from MH@@ H .
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already discovered that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es differ@@ ed with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
a total of nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played by little ones , who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with cri@@ es of more excited kit@@ ten , which were raised additionally .
despite the small sample for meaningful results , the researchers maintain their results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , re@@ acted differently to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned out faster to the speaker when this cri@@ mp of the very excited cat played .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop@@ ped with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men to baby no@@ ises several times in humans .
in addition , some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , reported the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ wen@@ ann .
Po@@ dol@@ ski resort to &quot; Gala &quot; after the Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ dum@@ b .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football game takes place in Turkey .
before the Du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ika Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul round the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
already in the suspension of the state of emergency after the coup attempt in July , the government regre@@ t@@ ted that the everyday life of normal citizens should not be affected .
this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt .
even before football it is not stopped .
the Prosecutor filed an arrest warrant against the former Hak@@ an Sü@@ dum@@ b .
accordingly , the South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ me@@ r is said to be the follow@@ er of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency suspended for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact most Turks have no effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country promised Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the Wor@@ ker Club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what unites the Great of Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ sch .
even the fans agree , no matter if their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski will once again arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as a top scor@@ er of his club .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy for his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record champion found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion .
after the round @-@ kno@@ ck@@ out of the Champions League , the &quot; Lion &quot; reti@@ res early in the Europa League .
there was only sixth in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we made it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the game year was better .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season hits as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ rich@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig laid the foundation for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez , who was under contract with AC Florence , had announced only borrow@@ ed Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club@@ chef Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the stri@@ ker would have to be willing to ren@@ ounce about a third of his estimated annual salary of 7.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Or@@ man realized : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t pay his salary at Florence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin had already been locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted Ath@@ le@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing continues the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who after a dop@@ ing barrier had su@@ ed her start right shortly before the games , was pi@@ ped out and rested with her start ( 100 meters chest ) .
it was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scenery : she was still standing in the hall with a bright smile and provoked her appearance .
when it was fixed that it would not fetch gold , the audience broke out into a che@@ ering tower .
but there are many other sports@@ men who go to the start despite dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he had already been banned twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
the Olympic champion from 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion has been under his spell even faster than before , he is number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to sit down for a six @-@ month ban in 2010 after taking the medicine with Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation she had severe tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion , World Champion of 2013 and European Championship , was positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the sent@@ in@@ els and was closed for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Peking Olympic Champion and twice World Champion about 400 m , had been tested in 2010 and had been closed for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement has been responsible , mut@@ ed mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ reproach , Belarus ) : hardly an ath@@ lete was recognised as many med@@ als afterwards .
thus T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to release Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he also received the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games due to a verdict of the International Sports Court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world ranking .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km of walking , China ) : the world record scientist and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was only tested in May , but can still start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world cup clu@@ es were found to take a banned food supplement , the barrier of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and ran already on 13 July .
bom@@ bing terror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ated - Sever@@ al deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital , but I can leave it again .
she planned her home journey for the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon are also Austrian citizens affected , be still unclear at first .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , such as waste .
Hu@@ a H@@ in , located about 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , was initially explo@@ ding two bombs on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , and another person was killed according to the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured during the det@@ onation near the popular beach beach in Pat@@ ong .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the south @-@ east coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded which killed an urban employee .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives have gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police .
finally , some det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast called for several injuries .
one expects from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee , Friday morning , journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too early to express itself about possible motives - but it was probably a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited territories and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary , it is assumed that the bombs have been bom@@ bed by opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta .
in recent days , the authorities have received intelligence on im@@ pending attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed of the exact time and locations .
it is still unclear which group is lying behind the attacks .
the police instructed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly do not address tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used for years by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the present bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommen@@ ding its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai safety authorities .
high security risk ( level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , not necessary journeys into these provinces is dis@@ cour@@ aged .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were made a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution processed by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives the military a great influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to fom@@ ent chaos while the country progres@@ sed towards stability , an improvement in economic conditions and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized the power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , considers himself to have led the kingdom to stability and order .
however , it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago in Bangkok , 20 people were killed at a stroke at a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to several state offices , the constitutional conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; clu@@ es for aspir@@ ations against the free democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Secretary Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way immigrants Islamic beliefs or from the Middle East are being de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we now observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot;
in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , H@@ esse , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; are already visible .
Mr Ma@@ arten said that his authority was closely aligned with the state offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identi@@ fiable movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief of the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extre@@ mi@@ sts in general try to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an embarrass@@ ing advertisement for your own cause .
the propaganda is intended to appeal to people emo@@ tionally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
recently , there were reports on the contacts of the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; of Af@@ D @-@ politicians from several federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has no knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
possible contacts of this kind are only relevant for the constitutional protection from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case - the Af@@ D - by certain persons who are extrem@@ ist , changes its target direction and becomes so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have an influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the significant increase in ri@@ ght@@ less criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ arten said he would not yet speak of new right terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in recent years we have noticed that there can be right @-@ wing terrorist structures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Liber@@ al Group .
it may well be that other right @-@ wing terrorist groups or groups of small groups plan to plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , asylum seek@@ ers or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of legal terrorism cannot be discern@@ ed .
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
Ma@@ ize expressed concern about the fact that many attacks entered the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before .
this is wor@@ rying .
many of the crimes suspect in attacks on asylum shel@@ ters were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different or elected for example , CD@@ U , SPD or lef@@ ti@@ sts , who , however , have radic@@ alised through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist mo@@ ods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always the Olympic champi@@ ons or world records determine the head@@ lines for the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ a@@ geous performance by Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia tended to slow down so slowly that he could no longer be seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his race with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 year old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming more known in under@@ represented countries .
since most athletes walk in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
soon the first nick@@ names made the rounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ckets of the W@@ hale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity ban &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Tr@@ ump sees the im@@ min@@ ent electoral defeat not so narrow
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump is speaking at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video .
he then goes on holiday .
losing Donald Tr@@ ump the US presidential elections in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately , it will either collapse , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ cans in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC .
if it did not suff@@ ice for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that is fine , &quot; Tr@@ ump said .
so he called the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
in his party more and more resistance was formed .
post climb@@ s into trading with electro @-@ transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle of the German Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell its electric car Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter as well .
the Group will shortly start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the post office wants to offer its electric vehicles on the free car market as of next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to go into the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been examining for months whether they will sell their self @-@ developed stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter with which letters and pack@@ ets are to be sold to other companies .
post @-@ chairman Jürgen Ger@@ des had said that there are always ques@@ tioning , for example by craftsmen .
according to the news magazine Der Spiegel , the Bon@@ ner Group plans to enter into mass production of vehicles shortly .
the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer in the post @-@ production facility .
Ger@@ des announced that the Group wanted to enlarge its fleet of electric cars significantly and put forward a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we are moving the whole fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active in Germany &apos;s streets since 2014 .
GF@@ RP leadership res@@ ig@@ ns after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ign@@ ations suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him remain .
turbul@@ ences at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of corporate management , the world &apos;s number five of the sector faces a new beginning .
GF@@ RP Chief Executive Officer plans to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , has already been dischar@@ ged from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
the management board member Gerhard Haus@@ bu@@ ck@@ inger , who is currently Managing Director of Gerhard Haus@@ bu@@ ck@@ inger , will take part in the Management Board as of September 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to mention a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
who will be leading the market research company in future , is still unclear at present .
it was said that on Friday , in the shareholders , the dis@@ appointment about the continued success of the restructuring initiated several years ago had been great .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K peak since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the recently bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder at some point becomes rest@@ less .
&quot; if that were the case with BMW , that would also do the odds , &quot; he said .
following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company did not have the opportunity to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales were 6.1 percent lower than in the same quarter of the previous year .
in the first half of the year , sales declined by 3.4 percent to EUR 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million .
in view of its difficult economic situation , earnings in the second quarter above all imp@@ acted the s@@ unken value of the company .
the company &apos;s impair@@ ments of EUR 139 million needed in the Consumer Experience business unit filed a loss of EUR 14@@ 8.2 million under the balance sheet .
in the second quarter of 2015 , Gf@@ K still generated net income of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - bus sli@@ ps in cla@@ ys in dit@@ ch : eight wounded
in case of an accident of a bus with 43 senior citizens , eight people were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her data , had to give way to a truck that partly ro@@ de on the opposite prop@@ eller .
the bus stopped right from the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as reported by the police officer Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ances came to the scene of the accident at Landes@@ straße 2 .
the unfor@@ gotten travelers were brought back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum by a regular bus .
there they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of waste water amount to 3,@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros as of October 1 , 2016 ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( so far 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 euro ( so far 2,@@ 18 euros ) .
at the facility in Az@@ tec , the waste water fee will be further increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed .
after a rough calculation , the sewage price in Az@@ tec will then be at 4.@@ 37 Euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , at the approval of the household by the district council of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , shel@@ ters were established .
due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the systems cost @-@ effectively .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to reach deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Head of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt showed the body , a re @-@ calculation of the fees for the sewage plants of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , either over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous period of calculations should be compensated .
the serious rise in fees was based on the fact that in all three wastewater facilities there were relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
for example , due to the low distribution basis , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly decreasing .
furthermore , in the past period of calculations in all three plants , refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair costs fell to a considerable extent not least due to their age of renovation and repair .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ th@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt referred to the fact that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the sewage system in Az@@ tec .
after almost 20 years of operation the first sewage pond was delayed , the sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of , the sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation system had to be installed in order to comply with the water law specifications in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which were to be taken into account in the new calculation period , came to these extraordinary expenses . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which are still below the current level in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that in the low waste water attack in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully penet@@ rated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the process , Schmidt added that the market community has remained spar@@ ed from large maintenance costs in the sewage plants over the past 20 years .
according to stone houses , the situation for the aforementioned installations will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the long run , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ bach@@ tal sewage treatment association will not be extended by these facilities because it is concerned with defici@@ ent facilities .
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1,7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the pre @-@ month of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education remained unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian carto@@ on@@ ist critici@@ zed
snapshot says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is un@@ aware of races .
with its filtering tool , Snap@@ chat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are un@@ blo@@ ated , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million more sel@@ fies per day .
all de@@ formi@@ ties get to the public .
in the past Snap@@ chat filters have attracted criticism in which they were bl@@ amed that the app would promote black face promotion or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week gave some users a filter , which gave them s@@ lit eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; j@@ aun@@ dice . &quot;
they asked themselves if these repeated contro@@ versy had pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced it would have turned off the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ tak@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ et@@ ers were widespread over the photos , that the filter was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hur@@ ting and easy to say was unpleasant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the contra@@ sting of a very contra@@ sting Asian carto@@ on@@ ist and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yellow face was pulled into the dist@@ al extreme .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride of pride . &quot; &quot; &quot;
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who in terms of race are more diverse than their older opponents - could more likely assume sensitivity to expect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates an image that is offensive to a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to remain un@@ noticed than it was earlier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for media , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and urged others to do the same .
in an essay for psych@@ ics and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes that racial @-@ based controversi@@ es mirror a lack of diversity among the settings practices at Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu , for the large part , critici@@ zed white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said Chin@@ es@@ ich @-@ ameri@@ can Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely left Snap@@ chat un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday it refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently set up a personnel responsible focusing on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in turn , Z@@ hu said that she will leave her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS secret service information , informs the Committee of the Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence @-@ intelligence to draw up an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground , reported an inquiry committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Members of the Ar@@ med Forces of the Ar@@ med Forces , intelligence committees and military budget compromise , reported a great dis@@ content among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence gathering typically enjoyed by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders posted a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were generally more positive than analyses of other news agencies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; K@@ en Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can Member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , stated .
the leadership mistakes in Cent@@ Com are reaching the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there are no direct indications that government officials have given instructions under Obama to change the reports , it shows how analysts seem exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the congress were clearly more positive than the facts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com entity publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from mid @-@ 2014 to mid @-@ 2015 , Central Command tips changed intelligence reports to reduce the risk of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information while investigations are resum@@ ed .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are underway through the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense .
democratic members of the Intelligence Service released their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an exc@@ essively limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the highest @-@ level Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the Committee , Member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compl@@ ained mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave excessive space for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention in the Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st in terms of a &quot; determined political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon General In@@ spec@@ tor , who were in@@ gest@@ ed by Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st complaints .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon press spokesperson , stated in a statement that the Department of Defence would not comment on the Congress while investigations into the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome controversial discussions on these important topics of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the Secret Information about the Islamic State reminds of disputes of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush envis@@ aged only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that contrary to the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , no significant effects on the terrorist group &apos;s financial situation would have had no significant effect on the terrorist group &apos;s financial situation , as these provisional refin@@ eries were put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ Com &apos;s dam@@ al@@ ous commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature because of his over@@ ly positive assessment of the situation during a hearing in front of the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the United States wins fourth match in women &apos;s field ho@@ ckey , a show@@ down with the UK is on hand .
one day after winning three doors during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also scored the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India , that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not one of the people who keep their doors in memory .
but she knows that : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are on the first place in their group with the Brit@@ ons , who remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first @-@ placed will take a little longer from the path that the other group will lead .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 seats .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time at the Dre@@ xel University with three years ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became National player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the 2008 Olympics because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , became coach of the national team and thus began to turn things better .
&quot; a cultural change , a mental shift and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ space in London that we now have .
we have been able to carry out the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a back@@ stop from the close range .
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed himself surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
she completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then pulled in the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guidance .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the U.S. go@@ al@@ keeper Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well is the result of the next game ending on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , how late it is , it &apos;s the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro continue to feel constant and inevitable , a fast relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is like the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ band to the tur@@ ner to the tri@@ ath@@ lete .
you can &apos;t turn on TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ verk@@ y or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there &apos;s Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could certainly have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel @-@ good @-@ TV advertising if he were a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ ast or even fen@@ cer .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports which are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have breast swimming and may it reign for a long time .
but if I have modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it became so spar@@ se that many people I had asked didn &apos;t know that it was an Olympic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , there has never been a medal in the trampoline jumping and until 2012 had an ath@@ lete who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider &apos;s charm , partly because it sounds more appropriate for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ lown school than the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but just a devoted enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never ending ru@@ sting impact - but also the gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that it essentially unites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asp@@ iring champi@@ ons jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are rated according to the official Olympic program according to design , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio against each other .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to go further , faster , up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and down , up and down at the playground .
they not only hunt the finish line or the original wall , but in the television broadcast another highlight : that of the world or the Olympi@@ ech@@ ism .
the goal oriented pursuit is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even add a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel as something ti@@ ring even when looking at these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing break .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up .
here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games .
the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , at 13 PM Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the end times as part of a post office on both days from 14@@ .00 .
in the midst of Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the anxiety and the objec@@ tification of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner recently suggested according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base according to air .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one generation protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long , an ally of the USA &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia clas@@ hed with government &apos;s violent resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses say that the police killed dozens of prot@@ esters during clas@@ hes with polic@@ emen .
is Ethiopia ever to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and spread to more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed on ump@@ teen un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
the circul@@ ating videos about the protests , which are presumably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security people strike young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Direc@@ torate is now asking for a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa at the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and secret services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorists across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , receive so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia is anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country has been restra@@ ined , with dissi@@ dents effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven to the depths of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options other than protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous gri@@ ev@@ ances covering everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold over power of the ruling coalition .
after a pro@@ vision@@ ally critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions are rising along the Er@@ it@@ rea border ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were forced more or less in recent years , could exploit and re@@ arm the turbul@@ ence .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness explo@@ de after years of t@@ inc@@ ening under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate through the social media , as cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians admitted that they gathered so too protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ per@@ as , who come predominantly Christian high countries from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in politics and economics as they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this too is changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ per@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ per@@ as and Oro@@ mos feel that Ethiopia is in@@ correctly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray that account for about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military , secret services , commerce and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ cally made disease in 2012 17 years long Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of North e@@ thiop@@ ia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had witnessed such a uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , which according to analysts apparently cat@@ ered by the government and then were stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed even though they were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in fighting poverty .
but obviously this did not prevent the internal dis@@ miss@@ al of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes on a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ anian town , conducted by Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray became more and more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighbouring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declares his claim Obama had created IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last contro@@ versy surrounding his campaign by ang@@ ding that his repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidates , whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelli@@ gible to the American public .
it also brings together his comrades who endeav@@ our to take him in protection during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position to explain statements that he could not have meant at all .
after having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump re@@ marked on Thursday and insist@@ ed in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret , the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump in a series of interviews said he was completely serious about the accus@@ ation .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t , Mr. Tr@@ ump , wanted to help mi@@ tig@@ ate the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential candidate did not want to know about it .
the last storm of criticism bo@@ unc@@ ed down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while trying to direct his campaign to the economic situation due to falling surveys .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
comm@@ enting on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech d@@ ull .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s e @-@ mails , but later he explained &quot; Of course , I meant the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans , how they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; clarify &quot; according to what the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates .
but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted an even more corro@@ bor@@ ative tone because his surveys have gone far@@ ther .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist published on Friday showed a leading edge in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general tries not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his hum@@ our .
but while he is intensi@@ fying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ r have brought his loyal companions to the in@@ convenient situation to stand up to him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , gave himself great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s statements , whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them h@@ ind @-@ bear@@ ers , completely wrong , and that is why it happened because he removed the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Republi@@ cans try to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of jumping around on each of his words and being bi@@ ased against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s ap@@ ology as just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
once the price has been disp@@ at@@ ched from the market , Café in Green@@ point will return
verb Cafe was a cre@@ amy café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served a good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices came from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store fron@@ tage .
soap Cher@@ ie , bought in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
native Americans occupied it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea hotel excluding and verb is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is changing , then it is also a rein@@ vention .
a re@@ vit@@ alized verb Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old Caf@@ eteria , the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els purchased the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nis@@ hing like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ced onions .
there are rice dishes .
the café does not serve beer anymore , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced by price from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebec@@ ca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg earlier and visited the verb regularly .
even after drawing to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
after the verb had been closed she gave up the coffee drinking for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it became clear to me that it lay at the coffee and the culture in the verb I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee again , even though they ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on this day instead of their usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
since the beginning of the verb in 2003 Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer .
he went there before work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came home after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
today , Ros@@ enthal still has his usual order , but sometimes he altern@@ ates his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no res@@ ent@@ ment to the fact that the soap business had taken the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for bre@@ wing with the cafe &apos;s cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;ll go into it yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he proposed to exhibit them soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice restaurant wants to fill and sell the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to a nearby building .
for many customers a new verb goes to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café concluded .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delic@@ at@@ essen on Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land ter@@ rap@@ ie soup .
his menu on this day was slightly more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , mas@@ hed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Mr Ziegel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Ziegel@@ man in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Publishing , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a repor@@ ter at the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , straightforward snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has already been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with mas@@ hed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the repor@@ ter ordered min@@ ced meat , this found the couple suitable for discussing the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years preceding the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male rim and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outlines the ways in which the land was about to be no longer a land of land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Co@@ e why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food , such as bre@@ ads and asser@@ tions , became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ ass@@ uring food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; bri@@ ck@@ man noted , as chefs were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients in a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rarely served luxury .
strange bl@@ ends were tried out , as a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction prevailed over taste or even healthy kitchen @-@ sense .
while resear@@ ching the book , which includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from that period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the house &apos;s recipes .
like never before or since , domestic business econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - changed the eating habits of the country .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keeper &quot; and to meet the challenge of turning pamp@@ as such as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historical delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
particularly tasty are the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ E@@ at @-@ attitude .
while he publicly fi@@ gured out the simple I@@ owa peasant house kitchen , he spoke like the million @-@ million man of the world he became .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental food like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in an almost golden dining room and bore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was truly stranger to reality .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if Ele@@ an@@ or &apos;s wife had asked him to post@@ p@@ one an est@@ amp with his stomach .
as described in the book , today &apos;s house@@ keeper showed no interest in flavors by Mr@@ s Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt that the White House produced the most boring meal in Washington , but also one of the most trop@@ hi@@ cally prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , &quot; Ziegel@@ man said , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw food away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; bri@@ ck@@ man rec@@ alled : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind@@ flow incident .
after the plates were removed from Eisen@@ berg &apos;s house , they and Co@@ e pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the ple@@ a dessert , which President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had lunch at lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , adding that it was a common trick to miss a modest name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ pped something reluc@@ t@@ antly a spoon in the tough brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it ta@@ sted not bad .
Co@@ E compl@@ ained three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on board to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a civil defence group , which according to Bild @-@ Zeitung had so far saved barely 6@@ 0,000 people .
29@@ 00 volunteers use their own lives to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the Civil Guard , showing him a 11 @-@ hour rescue from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians the shining symbol figure in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a hero he has never seen himself , said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he spoke in a video about the last bom@@ bing attacks in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died ; seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb so that no children can play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; c@@ ites his final words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ ral @-@ animal is almost 400 years old

it was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic .
Greenland sh@@ arks do not get offspring with 150 years of age .
lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k swi@@ ms at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1.@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it matters , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lifestyle influenced by slow@@ ness seems to be a patent for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock comments this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist presum@@ ed that Greenland sh@@ arks are st@@ ony .
only the evidence was lacking .
Greenland sh@@ arks are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks .
their slow @-@ pent@@ ines measured them when they out@@ fitted six animals with a transmitter in S@@ val@@ bard .
the boot@@ y nevertheless makes this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
possibly they hunt dor@@ man@@ t animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and seek cad@@ aver , which tor@@ ments from higher water layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sh@@ arks , which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 method the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks .
this centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had remark@@ ably high carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear ar@@ ming attempts to slow down larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimet@@ ers , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons tests , which is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all larger Greenland sh@@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lens nucle@@ us , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Greenland shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k should be 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland shar@@ k females only get offspring if they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length could assign an age .
since one of the animals at 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood on the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland sh@@ arks with the increase obviously allow at least one and a half centuries time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such methane em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence .
the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on on the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on a flame of as@@ par@@ agus .
so they mature later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often very large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal should rather invest his resources in a long life .
building site in double pack
in the latest session , the Municipal Council has focused on topics relating to building construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Board accepted Mayor Robert P@@ utz &apos;s release that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the marketing of recently reported housing areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the land , par@@ cel@@ ing and access questions have been clari@@ fied and the applications for surve@@ ying could be clari@@ fied , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ er weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - construction section 1 ) is nothing more in the way of interested parties .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au attract young families and former senior citizens alike .
as it was said , Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers can now register in the town hall from now on , and the municipal council is expected to give advice on the allocation of the plots in its September session .
in order to be able to make inquiries about the settlement of further commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year .
for example , the area of Unter@@ zei@@ lar@@ n is extended by two plots to the state road 2@@ 112 in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main , therefore , has the best chances of attracting thousands of jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the I@@ W &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether monetary policies can continue to operate in London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to date , approval in the UK is sufficient for the so @-@ called EU passport .
these are just big US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , according to the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight over the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk premium ES@@ R@@ B .
while in Paris the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is headquartered , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luxembourg is home to a large fund sector , but it also cuts worse in infrastructure as well as in infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
furthermore , the city with easily available commercial properties .
&quot; in Paris it &apos;s not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lan@@ der says .
on the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial properties were also 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of corporate consultancy , Merc@@ er , the city is standing in seventh place , Luxembourg in number 19 , Dublin in number 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , econom@@ ists say .
according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C Patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of legal charges resulting from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the infrin@@ gement of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which , in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical actions .
in the case of the complaint filed on Thursday , US counterpart Beth@@ Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman told that Gilead is entitled to reli@@ eving the costs incurred during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to share Gilead that controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck su@@ ed each other and claim ownership of laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops supported by the US say that they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j by the Islamic State
troops supported by the US have reg@@ ained full control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city abandoned them , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) continue to comb the city after the exo@@ dus of the remaining group of fighters who have under@@ min@@ ed themselves within the city .
they have freed more than 2,000 civilians who were held by the fighters as ho@@ stages , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish shared with the D@@ KS milit@@ ant Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council Reu@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just carry out cleaning jobs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday its tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the Pres@@ idential Candi@@ date of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton delivered an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book about her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax returns for the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hi@@ des behind false statements and re@@ treats regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not obliged by law on account of it .
Tr@@ ump , a New Yorker business man , and his lawyers argued for his refusal to control tax inspections by the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter referring to the publication of the Democrats candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps special advis@@ er , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax checks are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 , Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal poses questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business angels and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the subject and released a video on the internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump asks to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke on the topic during a speech on the economics of Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that Tr@@ ump paid no or very little tax during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday , the indications that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign .
Clinton is supporting a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would make sure people earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka demanded buff@@ ett , whose seat H@@ ath@@ away &apos;s H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here has its headquarters , Tr@@ ump into a meeting to exchange their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he had also been subjected to a tax check of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the elec@@ torate and not against tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has released a tax return until 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ ell@@ aqu@@ a , New York , on average paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax@@ pay@@ ers &apos; tax return from 2015 showed that they were only $ 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans .
their main investment position was an economical index fund from which the Clinton Divi@@ den@@ ds and income from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms equipped with ch@@ ill@@ i powder , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant prot@@ ector
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going in inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ill@@ i powder .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea years ago , intensified their promotion along with U.S. natural protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops without viol@@ ating animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is a world tel@@ eph@@ ones day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we have been able to observe a change in attitudes within these communities , being much more confident that they can hold the eleph@@ ants off their fields without har@@ ming the eleph@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first two steps include illumin@@ ating the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ch@@ ill@@ i powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ works body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord .
when it is ign@@ ited , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust at ch@@ ill@@ i powder into the air .
a hint is usually sufficient to ch@@ ase the elephant .
one last option is a shi@@ pper which shoots a gold mine fire@@ works into the air , causing a loud , light explosion .
city council votes unanim@@ ously : no new Ki@@ osk on the shores of St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er &apos;s investment projects of commercial companies with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and assume - just the retail trade in the core city can be seen as significantly out@@ dated .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new business practitioners , but at this location in exposed locations on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director sm@@ ashed Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; request - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after betra@@ ying that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israel &apos;s pre @-@ election because Arab guests were &quot; requested &quot; according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentation &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay Lanz@@ mann attempted to find Israel on the hotel &apos;s list of countries .
however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
following an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind this was even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the Internet , in which people called the whole thing a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of them subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the alleged demands of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ sten@@ dam@@ m , near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all alleg@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct instruction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not take Israel into the quick election list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police rel@@ inqu@@ ishes tear gas &amp; rubber floor against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students gathered in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police on Thursday when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police deployed tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began as police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , leading to the enforcement of rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
according to the opinion of the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the prot@@ esters were seeing Gra@@ ffi@@ tits spra@@ ying on P@@ rel@@ im@@ inary President Michel Tim@@ er .
the recent protests took place a few days after prot@@ esters in masses went on the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent year @-@ on @-@ year .
since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies on businesses in the country grew strongly , the ambassador shared .
Russian companies are taking up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
of course , further commercial expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan .
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports climbed by 9@@ 1.5 percent to Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was achieved by supplies of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan is heading for a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian delegation sent around 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , first and foremost to travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries regarding the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians attend Iran , something that the ambassador hopes to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally can recommend visiting the Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d towns , the monuments of the old Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sought after : beverage market inv@@ aded in forest oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y took place on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ med their faces , demanded the release of cash from the staff of the drink market and then fled at first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
the police did not share how much money was captured .
the perpet@@ rators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters large , thus relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible and poorly accessible from the park deck of the Re@@ we market .
the offen@@ ders must be scanned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich Engel@@ bert &apos;s path and fled from the dirt car park located opposite the car park entrance , possibly heading towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
who made observations at the time of the crime ( at 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) , which are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , is urgently to report to the police .
Nag@@ old : play and fun during daylight hours
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and you@@ ths of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the children &apos;s shelter Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors during their summer leisure in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in the quiet area of Lei@@ sure , the life @-@ loving group was quartered in the first week of school .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand we went to B@@ rest with the visit of the pet@@ ting zoo .
on the other hand , after Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special child guidance in the world famous monastery .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
at the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group spent at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and sp@@ lashing .
children and car@@ ers with their homemade pa@@ stries , such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ger Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were spoiled for culinary delights .
in workshops it was possible to create beautiful jewelry made of beads and stones or made of wood a Roman @-@ mill game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te Abend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the day of the voyage home the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and you@@ ths returned home satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily .
ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the mini @-@ stran@@ ts from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were dealt with .
in order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage of all the stran@@ ts in two years , the Upper Mini@@ stries round St. Anna decided to prepare and conduct several days of pilgrimage .
at the end of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered at the Freiburg cathedral on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy .
16 And Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gre@@ ene , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and hal@@ lows of the saints , went their way .
in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ ms and informed the pilgri@@ m sa@@ ils .
from Hor@@ b was driven by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where a Mu@@ enster loved one is standing and so the pilgrimage route took place from Münster .
the individual tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short pulse with different prayers , songs and written texts .
but also on the way the min@@ is@@ ers at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches came again and again to sing a song from a specially assembled pilgri@@ m song .
the parish rooms of the local par@@ ishes were available for overnight stays .
at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller made for a tasty and for@@ ti@@ fying dinner and the breakfast .
we continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
day after that , one stepped into the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but had to be climbed about 500 metres altitude in high @-@ time heat and then climbed again afterwards .
the deser@@ ved reward was a joint barbecue at the bath@@ house in the evening .
after the morning impulse in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage to Freiburg .

Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms right at home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Schot@@ t@@ lands Call@@ um Sk@@ inner went to fame for the last evening in the men &apos;s team @-@ Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor role , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made to E@@ igen . the J@@ ump and made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home in order to win a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed a shock@@ ing victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place at the London Under@@ ground World Championships despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Jamie staff member .
they did this in time as a hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man at which they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ du , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner made an Olympic ch@@ ord in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first lap .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ du fell short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a big part of the transformation that Hin@@ du went to a higher speed to slow him down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they got to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an Olympic ch@@ ord in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ di admitted that he intentionally fell on the track after a weak start .
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection from England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ di said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole UK flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team during the last three months .
we have gone so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation that won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days at the bicycle rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the field of possibility that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was just 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( a seemingly sacred date for British sport ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which starts today and will go for more than three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilomet@@ re race .
they arrived at the target in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday he fought with delegates before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his body size .
Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand@@ ong , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in World Record Time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 in the respective women &apos;s competition .
the GB team relies on its strong platform team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a flock of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
there was drama in the background , so Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s res@@ ignation in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and bul@@ lying alleg@@ ations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the now legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .
future of the enam@@ el of Port@@ land due to the aboli@@ tion of the energy contract
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places by workers - are at stake , as the plant operator den@@ ies the energy supply contract and thus will raise all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step followed the decision of the Victoria government at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant to be forgiven . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years is running in November .
there are up to 2,000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed in closure .
in addition , it could result in dom@@ ino effects , as the melt energy consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa joined the Point Henry enam@@ el , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year .
the enam@@ el of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step followed the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mel@@ amine with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p hold smaller portions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L believes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity from melting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have come into force from November 2016 onwards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
contracts have a period of 12 months , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , AG@@ L believes that the contracts in the 17 / 17 financial year will contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L revenues from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forec@@ asting strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L stated that it has already written the value of the contracts in its annual ab@@ ut@@ ment amounting to $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; expecting a termination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to guarantee the electricity supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said it concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which should have come into force from November this year , even if it is still a declaration of why it has withdrawn from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry prior to possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
referring to analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land annually consum@@ es about 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and tom@@ ago about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , that wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the man@@ ag@@ ress and mother of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans @-@ like ? ) , scrip@@ ted reality video that shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner family ( except the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) , as they forget the cover of their sister and ending with a classic twist : they all have a surprise party planned .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é act of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to leave her other girls to participate in this publicity .
with regard to the September edition of the Vo@@ gue , security has started a new era of car@@ dan .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her beating the cover of her Vo@@ gue ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most popular edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles rather an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the walt@@ z 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover star is so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still se@@ ep before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
over the last few years there have been clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who are gon@@ dol@@ as &quot; as &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover .
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer La@@ wr@@ ence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even with the little chance that Mrs. J@@ en@@ ner , who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the previous category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or reality stars or young people of today who know how to make a good snapshot video ( even if everything is true for J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women who sign in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success doesn &apos;t suit everyone .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world has always been ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; the mist@@ y of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were boiling again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but walking around on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ ming by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters will sell photos of them on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her own pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is seen in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
every year 16@@ 0,000 people have a total of 16@@ 0,000 people
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s auxili@@ aries are rejected each year by the Community law centers , while the sector is committed to the effects of further mid @-@ cuts on already over@@ bur@@ dened transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - are rejected in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ exploited exc@@ essively , are ready for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the community centers of Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Community law centers revealed that thousands of people are already being rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without an ann@@ ul@@ ment of the Federal Government &apos;s decision .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community service centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people of vital services you need are rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families that have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ ju@@ stly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of people in need from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call on the General Prosecutor and Federal Minister of Justice as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to lift these funds immediately so that people can receive the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their customer communities and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump Elec@@ toral Camp@@ a@@ ign accused after personnel allegedly drew weapons
new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps Camp@@ a@@ ign was charged with alleged in@@ activity after being told that their campaign leader for North Carolina put a gun on a staff while they were traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in a indictment filed by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i on Wednesday by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have been waiting for months to have been waiting for the matter to be settled internally before it realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , put his right foref@@ inger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the run in Vinc@@ ent &apos;s knee , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave B@@ ord@@ i in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compl@@ aining to local and regional campaign management , B@@ ord@@ i realized that at least four more people had had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he reported in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ord@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a ri@@ ot when he said to a crowd in North Carolina , the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm holders and arms friends - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton had to be appointed and appointed judge .
Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign clearly stated that the media would have torn out his words from the context and that he would not con@@ ta@@ int violence .
ordin@@ is complaint requires compensation from the campaign for violation of due diligence and Philip because of bodily harm and permanent mental damage .
hope Hi@@ cks Tr@@ um@@ ps was not reachable for an opinion .
attempts to contact Philip did fail .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer member of the campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : parliamentary elections survey : the SPD and the CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses are notable for the SPD and CD@@ U ruling parties .
this resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD , however , would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to head the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party only narrow@@ ly s@@ miles ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the parliament .
in spite of slight losses , the Gre@@ ens were reluc@@ tant to enter the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite light losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 percent respectively .
according to the survey , the German Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) sel@@ ects only 23 per cent of the vote in Berlin ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it still stood behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left of 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , but the pir@@ ates would miss the entry in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator was launched .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed nearly half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty pal@@ p@@ able .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be enough today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9@@ 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into business exactly 20 years ago , on August 15th , 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros lovers can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; office in the pocket format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for those standards at that time : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , al@@ beit slow .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smart phone era .
everything has changed since then .
smart phones are a success story though not for Nokia .
the phone division of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft .
today , the market ma@@ stered suppliers that came all a lot later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people &apos;s everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users around the world .
some 1.4 billion devices sold were sold on Samsung and Apple alone , of which 5@@ 55 million were sold .
worldwide sales of the devices are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
a whole industry has been created around the smartphone in the meantime .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market was not until the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on the Mac @-@ World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator , everything via touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s trium@@ ph@@ ant success started , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola , and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the legends now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention a matter of course .
on average every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to get the smartphone out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for staff at Siemens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered curse and blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me it was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London when we ran a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities alone , we will provide 10,000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ aming ourselves on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers each question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in wit@@ ty growth and leave a legacy of skills and jobs both in the airport and throughout the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented run@@ ways .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk that is backed by £ 16 billion in private investment .
London &apos;s games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olymp@@ ian spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and M@@ ouse Game &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to one of the software manufacturers , companies that earn money come to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to one of the software manufacturers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad block@@ ages on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus released a blo@@ gger post , in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his desktop site would change the coding regarding his advertisements to make it more difficult to detect the detection of which part of the page advertising is .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ battle between the anti @-@ clock@@ able open source community and the b@@ yp@@ assing has been underway since the invention of display block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators for the industry have become .
according to a survey conducted by Pa@@ j@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display block@@ ers worldwide , almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook over their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenues .
apart from the fact that mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and inst@@ agra@@ m , the company shared a spokes@@ man .
advertising on a desktop PC accounts for a large proportion of revenues so that Facebook feels the investment of such a stri@@ de as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ fer@@ encing tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have more control over them targeted advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook asser@@ ted that blocks would cause new filters to be wor@@ rying , because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokesperson in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we instead concentrated on developing tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of the people .

the police are calling witnesses , after a woman was transferred on a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday in case of suspected suicide by several vehicles .
the incident took place on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , who was transferred from several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police said that , as well as every witness of the incident , asked to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter told the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a clas@@ h prev@@ ent@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers will not be held ac@@ coun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that the mot@@ ori@@ sts do not have to assume that a pedestrian passes in the middle of the night on the highway as it was mentioned in the newspaper .
last year a police officer of the negli@@ gent killing was acqu@@ itted , after crossing a man and killed a man who was lying near Pay@@ erne a night on the A1 in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and was unconscious in the street .
the court found that the police -- who had responded to an emergency call -- ro@@ de in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climatic model : Venus was once inhabited
according to the projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was probably inhab@@ itable once .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to detect the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have had similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , drow@@ sy atmosphere and still turned slowly .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably proved more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate lives and protected against rapid evap@@ oration .
early Venus also benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus exhibits its daily side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; said scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus , which resembles the evolution previously suspected of planetary research .
although it was presumably inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light in the course of several billions of years .
their oceans were more suspi@@ cious and their water vap@@ or was blown away from ultra@@ violet light .
as its hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus , which as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy steps back as coach of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy res@@ igned as coach and vice President of Hock@@ ey Operations at the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che on Thursday and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association is immediately looking for a new coach .
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion .
during the summer I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give it more depth that it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and vice president of ho@@ ckey operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ acc@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was awarded as the best coach of the League during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he took the club on 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first lap of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell back five points behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , strike strikes again
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles on remuneration for North Sea oil workers are suspended while all the parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the Oil Field Service provider Wood Group were conducted spor@@ adic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current conflict , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold a few full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks that will begin next year to restart the problems .
the unions told that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against potential wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating is followed by a 10 % decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to place its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it ration@@ alizes its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson , at the beginning of this week met with workers leaders to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea for a generation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star @-@ loops of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster .
the new data will help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in star clusters rotate to different rates and in which context the rot@@ ational periods are associated with planetary formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star @-@ boo@@ sters , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light @-@ years distant from the earth .
many stars in this con@@ stellation , which emerged approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
you are now turning the fastest .
at peak rot@@ ational rates , these ri@@ pen@@ ing stars precip@@ itate large amounts of star@@ ches .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star is aged , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star stain -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars turning slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there is a lot ahead of us what we would like to know more about how , When , When and Why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and , so to speak , hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades rot@@ ational rates that will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional response , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will wear the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; to join , &quot; declared the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach in the future - with full salary .
as a player Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ Members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be included in the bas@@ eball hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field so cont@@ ested its appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in 2009 , the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; between 2001 and 2003 banned ster@@ oids .
in August 2013 , he was locked for 211 games due to involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is regarded as the main suspect for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could have done me a favour for 2014 , because I played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his f@@ arewell @-@ days are not no@@ is@@ eless .
while many bas@@ eball @-@ legends have once again gotten the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , received sympath@@ ies from the Y@@ ank@@ ee arch@@ rival Boston red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the followers sang in the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez @-@ Team .
Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio is not allowed to start .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing events .
a learned ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh day of competition , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre obstacle ski@@ ers Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already cri@@ tically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions , these messages come to an end .
the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de , which was used as a mas@@ quer@@ ying agent for dop@@ ing substances , had already been demonstrated by Ch@@ en last Sunday .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en could have participated in the events of more than 50 m Fre@@ est@@ yle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and requires from Ch@@ en full cooperation in the investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is no longer responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news se@@ ep over the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old himself went on the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ath@@ lete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it should deal with the forbidden substance about the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample was supposed to have had a positive effect .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately contacted criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation are not allowed to take part in Rio .
on Friday , the case called &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier .
both contest the ing@@ es@@ tion , but both must not start in the class until 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , the Dan@@ ek@@ owa event is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF World Association had forbidden the complete Russian team to launch , except for systematic dop@@ ing , but also the country of runner @-@ up in Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the previous off@@ ences in China also caused fierce disputes between athletes .
thus the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ est@@ yle , I want to commit myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun stood at the center of a debate with Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positive for the Chinese champion@@ ships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit down for a three month lock .
dat@@ ac@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail h@@ ack@@ ers her ran@@ som
black@@ mail program@@ mers are currently target@@ ing targeted companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey by the malware Defense Speci@@ alist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes of 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som required by the perpet@@ rators in order to be able to use the cont@@ ested systems and data .
according to the survey by Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software on attacks in company networks .
if they are successful , the potentially high @-@ yiel@@ ding ran@@ som will be significantly higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching an alar@@ ming rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most malware has been designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
first , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks quickly became frigh@@ tening in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of an victim , it sel@@ ectively searches for recently changed files , such as Word , Excel or database files , as well as archives of pictures and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als permanently .
subsequently , the software presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail .
to get the final turn code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
but where private users are using the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops .
the damage is correspon@@ dingly higher if a Ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 per cent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses through Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had even had to completely inter@@ rupt the business operation , in one case , people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data back .
for managers , it is difficult to reject the perpet@@ rators &quot; demand in the face of stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers in turn know this and try to build up a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure examined the user interfaces and contact with black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpet@@ rators actually attempt to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support sites or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t for free sample files .
and if private persons are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to return their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively risk @-@ free gains from the Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware roughly within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that three or four persons are involved .
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual black@@ mail .
the existing malware kits have been created by purchasing the malware itself , advice and additional tools for a unique fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included in delivery is a custom@@ ization tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski says .
the black@@ ma@@ sts then look for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
thus , one logs in one of the boards underground , bu@@ ys the set by a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is per infected host .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals then instruc@@ t Sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust that Ran@@ som@@ ware can be deter@@ red by file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful exploration , the perpet@@ rators are threatened instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , depending on the type of data , the damage potential is much higher than before .
the perpet@@ rators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things in the future .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz , Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of winter the activation of such a block@@ aded heating could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ rators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of the heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear , it does not work closely at any place .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit @-@ top drops off something .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l at high raised and 10@@ 26 l with inver@@ ted back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a movie armchair and thus offer storage space that is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to ceiling .
the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he should do his job a little qui@@ eter .
the average daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering should be somewhat more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the City emergency brake assist ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because it evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote @-@ light assistant works very reliably .
and the smart speed controller respon@@ ds to traffic sign recognition and throt@@ tles the speed when needed .
but the full connectivity is only available for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the petrol station from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with Euro 6 emissions standards .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Higher Regional Court ( Ober@@ landes@@ gericht ) Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable at haz@@ ards typical of aviation .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff broke down a knee cap in the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no compensation for the man .
case of illness : when does the organis@@ er pay
after their journey , ill vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back when the cause of the disease is beyond doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms .
in the case of the trial , a family suffered severe diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their door@@ way .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective treatment plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted sea water .
the family believed that the trip was flaw@@ ed - and compl@@ ained against the organizers .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed in court .
indeed the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organizer only learned about it shortly before departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then , he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
so he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information so the judgment .
especially since no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion with one another - belong to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said that in July many people would have worried about further attacks .
the state must react firmly and decisi@@ vely at the same time to acts of terror .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and division . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will not allow this triumph to the terrorists .
if off@@ ences would have to leave the country more quickly , however , this will increase security and strengthen the approval of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère aims to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in middle @-@ four @-@ digit order over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be under punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance aims to improve the right of arms to be amended in such a way that , above all , the purchase of weapons in the Internet is ham@@ pered .
the last much discussed sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors is to be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to look for solutions to reduce the risk of citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social care necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ sed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior spoke clearly against ac@@ tion@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an ear@@ thing for the char@@ gers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel the newspaper of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union for a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double nationality .
he considers a general prohibition of full @-@ obsc@@ ure for constitutional law .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d anything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses against court .
green boss Sim@@ one Peter repro@@ ached the minister that he wanted to simulate the act of action and action with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terrorist packages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; lef@@ tist party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a fleet of pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring people no more security in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow at the motorway rail
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this is to change : the legal defl@@ ection tax is to be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers who are in traffic jams on the ambient road every evening when they drive over the highway to the feeder ( A 43 ) .
on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , road construction will be extended by 700 metres in the area between Hammer Straße and the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
drivers can then jump right from the Hammer Road to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is split early , thus improving the overall flow of services on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of the parliament of Mu@@ enster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder nerves the drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the way back up to the bridge over the Alber@@ go way and sometimes beyond .
the reason for this is the con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , traffic is only ste@@ ered one lane over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rec@@ laimed thirty @-@ three years ago .
the reason for this is that static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the requ@@ isite load capacity to absorb two @-@ lane heavy @-@ duty traffic .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the related plant @-@ daily traffic jam will continue , the responsible state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art cannot say .
but to be reck@@ oned with years , because the bridge has an official remaining time of use by 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal bending stress , the state @-@ owned business has deliberately chosen the traffic weaker time during the school holidays , because it is to be expected with disabilities .
the traffic will be tra@@ cked by the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural Activities for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the forest school visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das Un@@ seen House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule children &apos;s house has attended a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theater in Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 students from eleven to 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the small house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migrant and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the context of this project .
between September 2015 and March 2016 , most of the students of the class have come to Münster , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and say little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic photos and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , the press release of the Young Theater in Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from Lingu@@ kel , and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration backgrounds between 14 and 20 will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
special offers for children and families in theatre play and theat@@ rical language mediation are being planned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Tourism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; goes on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the rise in refugee figures , the association reck@@ ons with many classes who want to participate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the star @-@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ gu@@ ck@@ ern a das@@ h on the bill in the south @-@ west of Germany on the night to Friday - but there is still hope .
the night was badly suited for clouds and rain to observe the sky spectacle , the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the Stern@@ schu@@ ppen are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour belong to the quick@@ est shooting stars .
they have their name because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which goes up in the northeast .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening , one rolls around for hours , at night one is awake for hours , in the mor@@ nings is already far before the wak@@ eup @-@ ring@@ ing no longer think of sleep .
it &apos;s all but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately one quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep problems manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons behind them , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for S@@ leep Medicine and S@@ leep Medicine .
the In@@ som@@ nia , therefore , is a distur@@ b@@ ance and sleep distur@@ b@@ ance .
just as a result of sleep , many people feel un@@ satisfactory or insufficient , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , member of the board of directors in the German doctor &apos;s association with practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this can organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs are stuck .
in@@ frequently , the sleep disorder is an expression of a different disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early w@@ aking is common in case of depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors cause one another .
for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be bad , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to pon@@ der on everyday problems and worries , We@@ eß will give an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or head@@ aches .
in order to relieve the sleep problem , it is important to find out what causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
there is hardly a resident sleeping physician in Germany , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , one should first contact the family doctor in case of sleep problems , advises We@@ eß .
this can be clari@@ fied with studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep lab , and what happens there ?
for examination in the sleep laboratory , medical doctors , for example , advise snor@@ ing with breathing plac@@ ements , in case of sick day@@ time fatigue , in case of sleep trans@@ duc@@ ers or if you do not find the cause of a sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , explains Fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please don &apos;t make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after covering , one goes to bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose go@@ ggles , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera records the sleeping @-@ ends on the ceiling .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which you can apply for a better sleep .
We@@ eß will count on : regular sleeping and standing times , not too long in bed , don &apos;t watch TV to sleep , avoid watching TV and don &apos;t look at the watch at night - then you start counting immediately , and that &apos;s quite and not con@@ duci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming has to do
the former German Schwi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has commented on Facebook as a dis@@ ap@@ pointing cut off of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he first took gold at the shor@@ ts world champion@@ ships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has protected himself from his explo@@ ding ex @-@ team @-@ mates via Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic Champion receives 20,000 € bonus and a jungle @-@ king 15@@ 0,000 € , no one should wonder about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page in the night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transport system in the swimming arena is bad , but dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at dop@@ ing and even operate it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be registered nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled for a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election ham@@ burger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream par@@ lor .
airport : Ban@@ de det@@ ained by baggage
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , the police freed the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 .
the crimes suspect had committed several bags and baggage theft as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 , civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf airport recognised a gang that was known to the police from past theft off@@ ences .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since mid @-@ July and were in a joint , progressive and particularly professional manner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the specialists of the criminal comm@@ iss@@ ariat of law 34 can demonstrate four actions to the thi@@ eves who had come to Germany to commit crimes committed to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , they had captured more than 15,000 euros .
old buildings , a couple of lin@@ den trees , in between still a rest cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain doesn &apos;t seem so at first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a fresh @-@ kn@@ itted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden .
someone &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; has spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house .
opposite to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed in the near future , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain calls , is preferred by burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants have le@@ ases , but on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the inner sen@@ ator Henkel has spoken out several times for a hard action by the police against the project , which referred to the area as a &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for police and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after ev@@ acu@@ ating the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rol three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team @-@ men on site , blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
in the meantime , construction workers were renovated in order of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later police and construction workers with@@ drew from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road seems peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others conver@@ se in front of Sp@@ ä@@ ti .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who holds three children here , are gener@@ alized above all by the police presence .
with the residents of the house projects they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who mostly wanted police protection from v@@ and@@ ali@@ ent lef@@ ti@@ sts .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police expose between land@@ owners and their neighbours , obviously does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which today , compared to the rest of the city , has a low average income and high poverty @-@ risk .
in 1990 , many houses were occupied in the former GDR , among them nearly the entire Mainz road very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer was ev@@ acu@@ ated by a large police force in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the district has become a magnet for tourists and poll@@ in@@ ers from all over the world . residents of GDR times and former household occup@@ iers are now sharing their neighbourhood with them .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them in wooden or freshly painted facades , which were thrown with colour bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year as often along with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ wing violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours consider this as a problem could be that crimin@@ ality is not necessarily affected by crime : crimes like bodily harm are directed almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes are subject to damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years , cannot speak of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is striking : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , they were definitely not .
even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has been consciously drawn into the streets of Riga - and remained .
that is why it was also so important that the residents get their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer the street will continue to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new buildings in former building gaps that the old residents disp@@ lace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is ultimately con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - people living here are rather people who don &apos;t feel so well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely can &apos;t appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should you do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the residents .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for en@@ gen@@ ders who are angry about color bombs : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the neighborhood .
those who prefer should be aware - just like someone who runs into a pub area that can badly complain about noise .
all persons presented with first names have asked not to be named with their correct name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Ur@@ bach since July .
the social educ@@ ator supports the team of the administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it sees itself as a contact person for all stakeholders : refugees , working group refugee assistance , administration , authorities and anyone else .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is here now , the ei@@ ving Woll@@ mil@@ ky , who has a problem above all .
thus , some - less mo@@ cking than rather on the multitude of desired tasks - meant pur@@ pos@@ efully , as the administration wanted to write out the job .
searched for was an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a da@@ un@@ ting Woll@@ mil@@ ky .
but administrative work is not her central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reg@@ ine client , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
new containers will soon be available in the Was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot;
municipalities are responsible for the termination of the connection .
you must place the refugees in your own or hired living rooms .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the administrative office to the commun@@ e and the Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far , it does not work , so it is necessary to rely on private dwell@@ ings , such as Deu@@ sch@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , common apartments must be in@@ timi@@ dated as it is so beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so soon new containers will be placed in the washing line .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine Kunde and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be und@@ one or furnished .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client .
many work in the building yard or help house master , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no occupational therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean labour .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so special offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
administration and honorary members also jump here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must explain to the refugees that it is just a long time and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever would eventually develop the feeling that he could no longer help in Ur@@ bach , do not work , and be useless , he will never integrate himself .
the clear majority was motivated .
but there are also problems , customers tell hon@@ estly , &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customers is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : have the two fears of radic@@ alisation after recent occur@@ ren@@ ces , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine tells customers quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve might call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins would get them completely out of sight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reg@@ ine client . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and honorary members must look for activities on the spot and in the region .
they have always been in the background that soon a new shock to refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
the policy is afraid to answer this question clearly .
actually it is unfair to put them on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine client also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach@@ s are already busy to integrate the present people in a reasonable way .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
