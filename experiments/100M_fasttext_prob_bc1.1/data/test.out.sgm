<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer visited with some colleagues a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton and Trumps Economic Policy in Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two U.S. presidents are not one in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are a fundamental philosophical distinction.</seg>
<seg id="5">On the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep the doubt small in doubt and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively back regulators, and he is making himself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "the state has to fulfil certain tasks, it has opportunities to open and needs money." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes would increase for the rich, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In that must be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost identically.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state-critical tea party of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "so, on Trump, internal discussions might still be possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and restart coal mining in the USA." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, the Paris climate protection treaty wants to announce it.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, wants to extend the renewable energies with its investment program and calls for:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade - just to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid better, rather calls Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of US $7.25 is a hunger strike.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage does not have to be changed, he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the taxation policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand stands Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics argue that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opposite player in the gold-plated hall of the St. Petersburg palace, I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile appeared to be sullied, and he barely emanated heat, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan however spoke again of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report a whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved like nothing bad happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But a sustainable cows emanating from Putin showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the firing of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin expounded and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The crime was even greater, because it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the veto is difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media launched a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting was only held because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan, who he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a cease-fire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily needed all the friends he can get after he has been relieved of his office last month with a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken it.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-seasonal onslaught on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the state television forecasted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports were allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemsti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West, as it regards its response to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "to this end, the ongoing resentment on the slug pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin is coming - the pike is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won in Ankara with security a bonus that he demanded assistance for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow that has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portray an "alliance of outsiders" when an analyst once described me: two countries which violate themselves from the West and feel badly treated and now unite.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents have said at the press conference that they hadn't even stripped the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and considering the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State talk at least once more.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin firing Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">For many years, IVANOV was part of the tightest confidence circle of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transportation Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement of the Kremlin it is said that without stating reasons, Putin has ordered" "" "the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian presidential administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been Deputy Director since 2012, has been appointed as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated in the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is called (in Russian) that he was later the chief of the clerks and staff of the government personnel.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convincing the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has taken Moscow away from secret.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants for a long time and worked like him for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff withdraws at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was advertised as a potential president, at once would like to derive the Russian environmental policy - came across great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin cited on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to give me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to entrust the contemplative post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the State Security Service, KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was the president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people whom he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third presidential term had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president again three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the North-deck of the Queensland crossings to the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closing of the" "" "ceiling blower" "", "which are approaching completion in order to reach each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 oblique ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown today visited the construction site and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witness of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is at its place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete shot for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, Project Leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first shutter represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of forward-looking high-end and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the tower on the north, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the landside.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, since the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approx. 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx. 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Uncle, because the tolerances on which the team worked are tiny - on each side they were only a few millimetres.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "the SPD and the Greens mean:" "" "investors should be put into duty much stronger in the future." ""</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the SPD will propose an" "" "room for action" "" "at the next meeting session." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But controversy is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all, the question is: who should build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, a regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "SPD leader Christoph Bratmann writes:" "" "we agree with the Greens:" "" "if you want to build on urban areas, you will have to pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The favorable apartments can, however, also arise in the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "however, the main conflict in the town hall is," "" "said viola:" "" "how to deal with investors who want to build on private land?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build on such surfaces at least 10 percent, but preferably 20 percent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing development funding program, which will cost millions and still has to be financed, should provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, says viola:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even tougher requirements for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, viola, a tightening of the situation occurs in the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the scope of action is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is not yet complete: the 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how is the loss of further approximately 1300 cheap apartments, whose promotion will expire in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planning policy spokesperson, Nicole Palm, should now be bought out of the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be considered to bring apartments back to the price bond.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the Western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved at one stroke.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western part of the year, deadlines run out at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price bond for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this does not want the owners, the housing associations.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the number of social housing in the West City is drastically increased, the aim of so-called mixing is to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially disadvantaged in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens reckon that there will be even more movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "said S & D President Holger Herlitschke:" "" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go into the boat." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children don't go outside to play but rather prefer to spend their free time staring on screens has been sued by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon go is about getting people from the sofa and making them more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later created a series of animation, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomenons of pop culture, interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the server overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, "photographed" (using a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the turkey and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" "" "average" "" "person withdraws every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which followed 35,000 users, informed the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of night-out people, who exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns to promote health that people want to" "" "take 30 minutes" "" "from the sofa" "" "and" "" "to be active every day" "", "because many public messages are dull to health and come from people who look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miracle of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also gruesome playing perishers, who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will fade away with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast klomm on Thursday promoted the title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall score of 62,198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team ameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medallist Aliya Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American female Simone Biles runs on the balance beam during the single multi-fight arena of women in gymnastics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Bilit is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-fight title, winning the fifth as she consolidates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey had ended at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rescue from her said she's "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It was expecting a final examination in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be regarded as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American female Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi-fight arena of women at the Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Bila got the first medal on Tuesday, while on the farewell party, the retirement of the team coordinator Martha Karolyi served as a sign of exclamation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Bilit insisted that, during its long path to the top, never to have the future planned, it is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gymnasium, was trained in the Boorman.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has lost no more competition, a winning streak, which will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafa was slightly deceived by two turns, the image deceives.</seg>
<seg id="27">Balance bars and ground belts - in which Biles holds the world title - loud.</seg>
<seg id="28">She recovered again with 15,433 on the balance beam - and took another 15,933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently when she expected her death - a pure formality - and tears poured out on Biles brilliant red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">Raismans' performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when fighting for third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "this time the 22-year-old team captain, called" "" "Grandma" "", "had a lead." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">After their practice, she threw Kushems to the public, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>

<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>

<seg id="10">The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the river Amite near Denham Springs, both of which are located in Louisiana, will most likely reach record levels over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood into the area opposite Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that a downstream flooding in Ascension Parish represents a danger, as these rivers are slowly flowing into the Lake Maurepas via the trodden rivers.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the Women's Olympics in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls from other skin colors.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, the Catholic is, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one of female gymnasts was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas proved to be a surprise Olympic medalist and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful Gymastics routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold for an individual multi-campaign event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but this is not what gymnastics in the whole country do not look like.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie hit everyone in the same way as Aly and Madison in order to get it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics are an expensive sport and Turner primarily in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, education, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for coaches and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sports clubs lie in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both athletes since they started gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to give the congregations an innumerable, young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to offer a more affordable and easy-to-reach gym.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastics of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban teenagers (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth of high-quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to care for the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such a thrilling time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic team gold and thank you for motivating so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way of becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 assistance doctors who voted to vote refused him.</seg>

<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of BMA Kommee for assistance doctors said last night in a message with: "assistants have still serious concerns about the proposed deal, in particular that it will fuel the current crisis of the workforce and to treat it to all physicians."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress has to be made and time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes caused by discussions were to take part in the government on reluctance and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>

<seg id="3">We spoke with Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer up for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">When you approach you from behind, you should turn around first, so that you can see your attacker and move out of the line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then hit him with the knee into the bar and twist while the aggressor crooked before pain, the weapon out of his hands. hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while they direct the weapon to him.</seg>
<seg id="8">For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker can not shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shift the weight on your gun at the same time and hit the aggressor on your chest, then twist the gun from its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveler subdued his immune system and the dignity of a serious test by leaking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and traveller Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shook his course on a Euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a push button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before checking each object, he used a Luminometer to show himself and show us what he is going to do.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "but the experiment titled" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "" "brought some surprising results to light." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of detecting a washbasin that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey across Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical experts about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing he leaked left more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestines by travelling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railings to stations to dishwashing of toilets, the job posed its immune system definitely among a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he told me: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was justified in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its test sample showed a luminance of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison to this, the luminance number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet he refused to refuse after their Luminometer number was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," "" "showing the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this comes close to the worst thing I have done in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not check here because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune systems.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we conducted crazy brainstorming that ended with saying" "" "Let's call Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary, we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had told him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to introduce Ian to them and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associated with lactic acid bacteria especially with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing attached lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their social housing after a deluge with a loss of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebiloba were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After forcibly removed from their property, shocking employees of the housing cooperative found their property in an irreparable state.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had gaping holes, wooden floor boards were torn, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated on the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family was resettled and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for home administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>

<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years</seg>

<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their actions for their neighbors had to be terribly involved.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community courageously approached us and gave us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee immediately informed a disciplinary committee to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">A Kenyan official informed that the former Sprinter and present coach, John Anzrah, gave a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-meter-runner Ferguson Rotich.</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF world association has asked the IOC for information about the case in order to exert its own investigations, a IAAF narrator announced.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," "" "it stated in an IAAF explanation." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"he (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and served as Ferguson Rotich, handed over the sample and signed," explained Kenias head of mission Stephan Arap Soi.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who stood on the list for training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Rotich was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015.</seg>

<seg id="17">In the announcement of the more than 2000 doping target controls submitted by the IOC, more than 2000 doping target controls in front of the Rio Games were usually pointed out in advance that athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted.</seg>
<seg id="18">The World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted a lot of pressure on African land before the summer Olympics, an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>

<seg id="25">In doing so, it was possible to demonstrate that this type of sport was undercut and systematically subdued.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia do not choose the day of the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">By 2021, the Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because more stupidly than hitherto it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and district heating struggle - that bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "the locals, who are to be convinced by the election fighters, are on holiday." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Ruegen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the day of the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">Practical problems come about: during the holidays, helpers, posters hang up, inflating balloons, distributing flyers and counting voices, only ardued with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="9">By September 4, 2016, the election and final day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign close to the people over itself.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting will be how strongly newcomer AfD cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government for 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous campaign for election.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as he did his legendary word-careous predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Apart from that, soul ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the blooming of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her refugee policy, her "We are creating," has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry.</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its leading candidate, the interior minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is if you make election campaigns at the right time at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to open-air demonstrations; Merkel's election district is located in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority from other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it is too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Nordost-CDU largely renounces the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "that, coking, plays only a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Union has also noted that on the land you will crumble the base that it must be very hard to find a wire to the people again." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">You are going on like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly any in the expanses of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU-electoral campaigner Kokert on his comrades is also self-revealing: "you must go where it hurts, where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday celebration must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called on its SPD to a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Socialists and Democrats recently stood at 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just in front of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the 2011 election, the SPD gained a clear victory of 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, small party with seven percent in polls, should make the leap into parliament.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the necessity of holidays and largely relocate their campaign to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online voting campaign" is called the president Claudia Müller.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, green electives embark on a search for clues after local vocal chords.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just curvots with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and still finds it beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for construction work, which start at 5.30 a.m. and end only at 8 p.m., there are all praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "they made everything pretty crisp," "" "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything will be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">The commencement of those responsible for construction works is also commended, for example when it comes to the establishment of expeditions.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and the blocking of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen was cancelled and the connection to Rottenburg again, the traffic situation within the village has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now proceed from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The credential traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some serious complaints," says the Deputy Head of Sales, Florian King, responsible for the restructuring of the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weihering had to fight with more traffic noise because many sneaks were looking for and more familiar to their Navi than the signs.</seg>

<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the street is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B-27-refurbishment has led to drop-in breakthroughs allows everyone to see through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been released, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages inherent in the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other districts, where it has been handled more generously.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, he points to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regulars look less frequently due to complicated traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it's also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele comes back at the end of the rehabilitation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian flu, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long-term history.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged loves plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Prior to submitting a comment section, under the pseudonym non-allotenity of men of the middle ages with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the multilingual reformation of records is not attributable to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but back to mid-life nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight after between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horden by amateur collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older turntables retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and I'd say, "So, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there's still a handful of fantastic record specialist shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to judge their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, of Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into the Reckless Records (Number of data: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I appreciate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 sheets.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and re-bought items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought I was probably a bit too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink too much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers, whom he meets, apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pump, people who have heard about their comeback and are anxious to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have led, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to supporters of the plate revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a store like Follonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ some of the older customers took off the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar sound boards, of objects that recall happy memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it may be the filling of emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector so I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee floundered from a record stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I puff through a stack of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came up only recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead record, so that I can put it on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less music-class.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Opp, which has dedicated the record almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists that make photos, teenage boys and women middle-aged.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts's newest synthesizer and sexed pop instead of experimental jazz rockets from the loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but psychic traumas are hard to detectable if you stand beside someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of sheets available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a window-shopping than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, so collecting sheets is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or in another way, but the beauty of records is... "she drives with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I have the appearance of mustering jeans hot pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential panels for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group, who has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research yielded that the results of YouGov agree, they do not take into account the large number of female collectors in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't spend their Thursday morning with the bump of plate shops of Berwick Street and the sheets through plates as they avoid the staring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who rises above the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 provisional stores where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell hairdresser services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which contain a risk of fire and sickness.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the dish that businesses and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also indicated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people using the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais were absolutely understandable. "</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely feed people who live" "" "in extremely precarious conditions" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet places between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the collapse was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated in a public manner and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids "Café.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers must adapt to the next generation of speed knives: in different federal states, including in Hesse and Brandenburg, new lightening units are being tested, which should be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement Trailer from Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident sites where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on motorway construction sites or to rehabilitate bridges with temporary templates, there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary flash for compliance with speed limiter.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days, while the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be tracked at the same time across multiple tracks.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as access bans according to time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the advanced state, the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hitch according to the manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="10">So that it is not simply stowed, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels in the armoured and incidentally also cast-resistant outer cover disappear.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the glitter from vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since 2015, the trailer has been tested according to the information provided by Vitronic in different federal states and is now also used.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance during the 7-day rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of fijis when they were beaten in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the Deodorus Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, back, line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any colour.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was lost due to the not too bad price of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji could have smitten a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a consolation for UK - but it probably won't - that at least a brite tomorrow will hang a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, Ryan lost every game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This stage is going to hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began to surprise and let the Gb attacks bounce off from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if you were running in running buses. the World Series winners walked 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau froze around in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">After four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A protracted Tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it has only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute athjasa Veremalua in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new member since the replay and there was still about a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presided over further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GGB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led basic changes to the half-time and closed down the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the circumstances of the first half until Joshua Tuisova ran through a brilliant interplay by Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea-swimmers, whose fans sang, flags swinging and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a tight half-finalmatch from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown took the Boks in the first half forward, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Shooting inspired by the fight against the trainer's cancer</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinarian gold than with these games and that wants to be hot.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rudder angle to the last 220 hard pieve, which enter history, Helen Bell and Heather Stanning invented an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when they rowed to the second Olympic champion in a second without a tax-woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sports who set on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, at least their 39.ter unwritten application, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletins gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of the triumphal march.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to incremental advances that make the difference and no one was more helpful than the coach who did not know if he would survive this day at all, when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risked.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and that did they.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, he spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather awful situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that was the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve wrecking morning listening to something more than usual and trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "panning who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan said" "" "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's maybe something extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It just repeats how much this means to me how much I and Helen and Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning didn't lose a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with it.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up, panning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to get carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not sure to make something great.</seg>

<seg id="8">Behind all this Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the cohesion association, stands for 28 years as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now he was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water-purpose-association of the Veitenstein-Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes approximately 150000 cubic metres of water each year and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The municipalities of Kirchner, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach are member communities.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are supply contracts for further cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunn Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a watershed in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zweckverband in 1988.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for the German Steel Industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity extraction are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">The German Steel Industry, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), the Minister of Economic Affairs, said the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened with an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissar Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG levy of 20 percent applies.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this will not be levied in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission for its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result, the status quo of the previous regulation is mostly pre-recorded.</seg>

<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and substantial price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation continued to exacerbate the situation when the world's largest producer of products made massive steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers are throwing Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has eased a little.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, tracked import duties on import steels have an impact, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have brightened.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least the prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The sector responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works at the end.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel manufacturers are cautious.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the same period of the previous year, as the Wirtschaftsvereinigung Stahl announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May the produced volume went back the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Production has been around two percent lower than the previous year's figure since the beginning of the year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing does seniors well</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal she feels balanced, cheerful and more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniorenliga.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and cultivate social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to speak and organise, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand their lungs get out of the powder in everyday life as well.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Association of Senior Citizens "Organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher significance, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, it explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses a lot of memories, often connected with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies self-dementia sufferers are declining for long past events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a special performance is required for the head, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">Focusing simultaneously on one's own voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just elderly people who live alone practice not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The feeling of self-esteem increases through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time for something, I get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate, even if you think you have little talent, Lenz betrays.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a note goes next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer seniors have various options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a retirement home, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask family, friends or neighbors for help with internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to sing, you should necessarily join a choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul good and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to limited territories and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">On the contrary, it is assumed that the bombs have been bombed by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent days, the authorities have received intelligence on impending attacks in the south of the country - however, they were not informed of the exact time and locations.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is lying behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police instructed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but mostly do not address tourists.</seg>

<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were made a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution processed by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military a great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to foment chaos while the country progressed towards stability, an improvement in economic conditions and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, who had seized the power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, considers himself to have led the kingdom to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago in Bangkok, 20 people were killed at a stroke at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>

<seg id="6">In social networks, Habte became a viral internethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished his race with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>

<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming more known in underrepresented countries.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the facility in Aztec, the waste water fee will be further increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a rough calculation, the sewage price in Aztec will then be at 4.37 Euros per cubic metre.</seg>

<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Head of the Board of Directors, Herbert Schmidt showed the body, a re-calculation of the fees for the sewage plants of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, either over- or undercover from the previous period of calculations should be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">The serious rise in fees was based on the fact that in all three wastewater facilities there were relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, due to the low distribution basis, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the past period of calculations in all three plants, refurbishment and repair costs fell to a considerable extent not least due to their age of renovation and repair.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for Welthahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt referred to the fact that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the sewage system in Aztec.</seg>
<seg id="16">After almost 20 years of operation the first sewage pond was delayed, the sewage sludge had to be disposed of, the sewage sludge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation system had to be installed in order to comply with the water law specifications in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which were to be taken into account in the new calculation period, came to these extraordinary expenses."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which are still below the current level in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapshot says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is unaware of races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unbloated, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million more selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All deformities get to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the past Snapchat filters have attracted criticism in which they were blamed that the app would promote black face promotion or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week gave some users a filter, which gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "jaundice."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked themselves if these repeated controversy had pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it would have turned off the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of hurting clichés.</seg>

<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for media, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for psychics and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racial-based controversies mirror a lack of diversity among the settings practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu, for the large part, criticized white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>

<seg id="9">Although there are no direct indications that government officials have given instructions under Obama to change the reports, it shows how analysts seem exposed to pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the congress were clearly more positive than the facts," "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom entity publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, so much is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From mid-2014 to mid-2015, Central Command tips changed intelligence reports to reduce the risk of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information while investigations are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the CentCom reports are underway through the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Service released their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an excessively limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "" "said the highest-level Demokrat in the Committee, Member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "complained morals among analysts and" "" "gave excessive space for divergent opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention in the CentCom Analyst in terms of a "determined political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon General Inspector, who were ingested by CentCom Analyst complaints.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesperson, stated in a statement that the Department of Defence would not comment on the Congress while investigations into the General Inspector are still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have diverging opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome controversial discussions on these important topics of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the Secret Information about the Islamic State reminds of disputes of more than ten years ago when a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a piece about how the then government under George W. Bush envisaged only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the revolt against current coverage of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to the government's statements against the refineries held by the Islamic State, no significant effects on the terrorist group's financial situation would have had no significant effect on the terrorist group's financial situation, as these provisional refineries were put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">CentCom's damalous commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature because of his overly positive assessment of the situation during a hearing in front of the Senate.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro continue to feel constant and inevitable, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is like the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the wristband to the turner to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Leverky or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there's Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, could certainly have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel-good-TV advertising if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports which are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have breast swimming and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I have modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years it became so sparse that many people I had asked didn't know that it was an Olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, there has never been a medal in the trampoline jumping and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider's charm, partly because it sounds more appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert, but just a devoted enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never ending rusting impact - but also the grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially unites.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "they are rated according to the official Olympic program according to design, difficulty and" "" "flight time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio against each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to go further, faster, up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and down, up and down at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only hunt the finish line or the original wall, but in the television broadcast another highlight: that of the world or the Olympiechism.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal oriented pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even add a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel as something tiring even when looking at these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, apparently weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, at 13 PM Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the end times as part of a post office on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the anxiety and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner recently suggested according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base according to air.</seg>

<seg id="3">"" "" "" "protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia clashed with government's violent resistance." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that the police killed dozens of protesters during clashes with policemen.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia ever to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and spread to more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's response was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed on umpteen unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">The circulating videos about the protests, which are presumably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security people strike young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Directorate is now asking for a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with Ethiopians to fight terrorists across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia is anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country has been restrained, with dissidents effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven to the depths of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and don't have any other options other than protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous grievances covering everything from land use to stranglehold over power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a provisionally criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions are rising along the Eritrea border; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were forced more or less in recent years, could exploit and rearm the turbulence.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of tincening under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through the social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more common and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians admitted that they gathered so too protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amperas, who come predominantly Christian high countries from Ethiopia, prospered in politics and economics as they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this too is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Ampera and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amperas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is incorrectly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray that account for about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, secret services, commerce and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-publically made disease in 2012 17 years long Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the present regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of North ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had witnessed such a upheaval in 2005 after thousands of elections protested, which according to analysts apparently catered by the government and then were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed even though they were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the internal dismissal of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, an amanian town, conducted by Tigray and the hatred of the Tigray became more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighbouring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares his claim Obama had created ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by angding that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidates, whether he was able to communicate clearly and intelligible to the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings together his comrades who endeavour to take him in protection during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump remarked on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret, the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump, he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump in a series of interviews said he was completely serious about the accusation.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt, Mr. Trump, wanted to help mitigate the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican Presidential candidate did not want to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism bounced down on Mr. Trump, while trying to direct his campaign to the economic situation due to falling surveys.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Commenting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech dull.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he criticised himself when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's e-mails, but later he explained "Of course, I meant the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary," clarify "according to what the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corroborative tone because his surveys have gone farther.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist published on Friday showed a leading edge in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump in general tries not to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is intensifying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherr have brought his loyal companions to the inconvenient situation to stand up to him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent advocates, gave himself great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "Mr. Giuliani said he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Trumps's statements, whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them hind-bearers, completely wrong, and that is why it happened because he removed the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of jumping around on each of his words and being biased against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, sorry" "" "television experts who try to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats ridiculed Mr. Trumps's apology as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once the price has been dispatched from the market, Café in Greenpoint will return</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a creamy café in Williamsburg, where you could pay only cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served a good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices came from his Bedford Avenue store frontage.</seg>
<seg id="4">Soap Cherie, bought in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Native Americans occupied it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea hotel excluding and verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is changing, then it is also a reinvention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalized verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old Cafeteria, the owner and managing director of the new cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels purchased the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishing like capers and sauced onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café does not serve beer anymore, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "many old customers were also displaced by price from Williamsburg," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg earlier and visited the verb regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after drawing to Greenpoint, she would take the path.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb had been closed she gave up the coffee drinking for a while, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "it became clear to me that it lay at the coffee and the culture in the verb I liked," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">Now they drink coffee again, even though they ordered a blended Chai Tea on this day instead of their usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Since the beginning of the verb in 2003 Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and loyal customer.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before work and invariably ordered the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I came home after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything bagel with butter," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Today, Rosenthal still has his usual order, but sometimes he alternates his Everything bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rodriguez said that he had no resentment to the fact that the soap business had taken the old business space.</seg>
<seg id="36">In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered a special soap for brewing with the cafe's cold brewed coffee as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "I think we'll go into it yet," "" "said Rodriguez." ""</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoints also accepted the café.</seg>
<seg id="39">A new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he proposed to exhibit them soon so that his new neighbors feel welcome.</seg>
<seg id="40">The location also has other advantages.</seg>
<seg id="41">A local juice restaurant wants to fill and sell the cold brewed coffee.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebral-animal is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks normally only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research ship.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland sharks do not get offspring with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark swims at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1.220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle influenced by slowness seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal "Science" at any rate from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist presumed that Greenland sharks are stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland sharks are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow-pentines measured them when they outfitted six animals with a transmitter in Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">The booty nevertheless makes this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt dormant animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and seek cadaver, which torments from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks, which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitsbergen as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long while the largest 502 centimeters measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals they analyzed with the carbon-14 method the lens nucleus of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had remarkably high carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear arming attempts to slow down larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimeters, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, which is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lens nucleus, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark should be 502 centimeters even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland shark females only get offspring if they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals at 392 centimeters probably stood on the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland sharks with the increase obviously allow at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methane emes live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland wal, in whose bacon on the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a flame of asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as early as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should rather invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The mini-strants from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage of all the strants in two years, the Upper Ministries round St. Anna decided to prepare and conduct several days of pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the end of the Holy Year of Mercy, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered at the Freiburg cathedral on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 And Minis from Bittelbronn, and Greene, and Haigerloch, and hallows of the saints, went their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrims and informed the pilgrim sails.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where a Muenster loved one is standing and so the pilgrimage route took place from Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual tours were framed in the morning and in the evening by a short pulse with different prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way the minisers at field crosses, chapels or churches came again and again to sing a song from a specially assembled pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">The parish rooms of the local parishes were available for overnight stays.</seg>

<seg id="14">Day after that, one stepped into the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but had to be climbed about 500 metres altitude in high-time heat and then climbed again afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the bathhouse in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>

<seg id="2">Schottlands Callum Skinner went to fame for the last evening in the men's team-Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made to Eigen. the Jump and made the legend proud when he stormed home in order to win a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place at the London Underground World Championships despite the withdrawal of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the Jamie staff member.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man at which they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindu, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner made an Olympic chord in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won the first lap.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindu fell short after his lap, but Kenny brought the team to the front and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a big part of the transformation that Hindu went to a higher speed to slow him down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they got to the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said," "" "It's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic chord in the final round and defeated the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hindi admitted that he intentionally fell on the track after a weak start.</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection from England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hindi said:" "" "it feels like the whole UK flags on the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team during the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have gone so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days at the bicycle rom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny, it is in the field of possibility that he repeats Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was just 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sport; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the Sprint, which starts today and will go for more than three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old Bolton said," "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the target in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3: 51.659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he fought with delegates before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his body size.</seg>
<seg id="43">Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shandong, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World Record Time in 4: 13,260 in the respective women's competition.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong platform team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a flock of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">There was drama in the background, so Shane Sutton's resignation in April in the midst of sexism and bullying allegations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GBs, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be jeopardized in closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could result in domino effects, as the melt energy consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias.</seg>

<seg id="9">The enamel of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the managress and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on their Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," "" "wrote Kendall." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The unveiling of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians-like?), scripted reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn), as they forget the cover of their sister and ending with a classic twist: they all have a surprise party planned.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the cliché act of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?" with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to leave her other girls to participate in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September edition of the Vogue, security has started a new era of cardan.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim likes her beating the cover of her Vogue (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most popular edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles rather an illustrated book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the waltz 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still seep before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">Over the last few years there have been clearly more "celebrities who are gondolas" as "models, celebrities" on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the little chance that Mrs. Jenner, who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or young people of today who know how to make a good snapshot video (even if everything is true for Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women who sign in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the publication of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenners's success doesn't suit everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With their reality TV history, Jenners's position in the fashion world has always been tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-Model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the misty of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were boiling again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But walking around on the Missmut seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your priming by Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all her sisters will sell photos of them on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her own pictures of Cindy Crawfords's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>

<seg id="1">Berlin / Schwerin: parliamentary elections survey: the SPD and the CDU lose</seg>
<seg id="2">In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (September 4) and Berlin (September 18), significant losses are notable for the SPD and CDU ruling parties.</seg>
<seg id="3">This resulted in representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition could govern in the north, this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">In both federal states, the SPD, however, would be the strongest party and would have good chances of continuing to head the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party only narrowly smiles ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would come to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="10">In spite of slight losses, the Greens were reluctant to enter the Schwerin Landtag despite light losses of 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="11">NPD and FDP were not represented in the Landtag with 3 percent respectively.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the survey, the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) selects only 23 per cent of the vote in Berlin (election 2011: 28.3 percent).</seg>
<seg id="13">The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">It still stood behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the left of 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="15">The AfD would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="16">With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the entry in contrast to 2011.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-mail and internet in slow motion: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator was launched.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was pretty palpable.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough today for about two selfies with high resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "the" "" "Nokia 99000 communicator" "" "came into business exactly 20 years ago, on August 15th, 1996, and it was the first smartphone." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros lovers can still buy the equipment on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as "office in the pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for those standards at that time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator was to be reached.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser, albeit slow.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we found a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Quite proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could suspect in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smart phone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Everything has changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story though not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, the market mastered suppliers that came all a lot later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Always and everywhere online, this is today for a lot of people's everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users around the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">Some 1.4 billion devices sold were sold on Samsung and Apple alone, of which 555 million were sold.</seg>
<seg id="28">Worldwide sales of the devices are around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">This includes the well-running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">A whole industry has been created around the smartphone in the meantime.</seg>

<seg id="32">He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone and an Internet communicator, everything via touch screen easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="33">Apple's triumphant success started, even today, the iPhone is the most important product of the Group.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola, and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had a look.</seg>

<seg id="3">On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockages on its desktop site, Adblock Plus released a blogger post, in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to re-block advertising on the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that his desktop site would change the coding regarding his advertisements to make it more difficult to detect the detection of which part of the page advertising is.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin-and-Her-battle between the anti-clockable open source community and the bypassing has been underway since the invention of display blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police are calling witnesses, after a woman was transferred on a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday in case of suspected suicide by several vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident took place on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman lay in the dark "in an act of despair" on the road and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49, who was transferred from several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several drivers have already heard, but some have not yet been identified, the police said that, as well as every witness of the incident, asked to report.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "an investigative procedure was opened, which is a" logical "" "" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve. "" "</seg>
<seg id="10">However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a clash preventable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "this is something that the prosecutor has to decide," "" "said Hofstetter." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers will not be held accountable.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that the motorists do not have to assume that a pedestrian passes in the middle of the night on the highway as it was mentioned in the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year a police officer of the negligent killing was acquitted, after crossing a man and killed a man who was lying near Payerne a night on the A1 in August 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had drunk and was unconscious in the street.</seg>
<seg id="17">The court found that the police -- who had responded to an emergency call -- rode in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely unusual and unforeseeable situation," the judge said.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was probably inhabitable once.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to detect the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have had similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, drowsy atmosphere and still turned slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably proved more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate lives and protected against rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus exhibits its daily side of the sun for almost two months," said scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as a umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus, which resembles the evolution previously suspected of planetary research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was presumably inhabitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light in the course of several billions of years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans were more suspicious and their water vapor was blown away from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As its hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus, which as we know it today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data will help astronomers understand why stars in star clusters rotate to different rates and in which context the rotational periods are associated with planetary formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star-boosters, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star-pile of the Pleiades is 445 light-years distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this constellation, which emerged approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">You are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotational rates, these ripening stars precipitate large amounts of starches.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star is aged, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star stain -- like sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars revolve more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities like rotational rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the constellation of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is a lot ahead of us what we would like to know more about how, When, When and Why stars slow down their rotational rates and, so to speak, hang up their "dance shoes."</seg>

<seg id="1">Dataclau: so perfide blackmail hackers her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Blackmail programmers are currently targeting targeted companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware Defense Specialist Malwarebytes of 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ransom required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the contested systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the survey by Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize their blackmail software on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful, the potentially high-yielding ransom will be significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching an alarming rapid evolution of the malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most malware has been designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks quickly became frightening in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of an victim, it selectively searches for recently changed files, such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals permanently.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the receivables of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final turn code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users are using the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">The damage is correspondingly higher if a Ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses through Ransomware, 13 percent had even had to completely interrupt the business operation, in one case, people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">Yet 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the perpetrators "demand in the face of standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try to build up a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure examined the user interfaces and contact with blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually attempt to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites or decrypt for free sample files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private persons are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to return their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risk-free gains from the Ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware roughly within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that three or four persons are involved.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The existing malware kits have been created by purchasing the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in delivery is a customization tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," Wisniewski says.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmasts then look for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">Thus, one logs in one of the boards underground, buys the set by a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is per infected host.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals then instruct Spammer with the spread," "" "Wisniewski explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey trust that Ransomware can be deterred by file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful exploration, the perpetrators are threatened instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thus, depending on the type of data, the damage potential is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz, Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the activation of such a blockaded heating could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="10">The luggage compartment can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he should do his job a little quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The average daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>

<seg id="22">And the smart speed controller responds to traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is only available for top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the petrol station from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one rolls around for hours, at night one is awake for hours, in the mornings is already far before the wakeup-ringing no longer think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's all but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, approximately one quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons behind them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Medicine and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Insomnia, therefore, is a disturbance and sleep disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just as a result of sleep, many people feel unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of directors in the German doctor's association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this can organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also drugs are stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently, the sleep disorder is an expression of a different disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early waking is common in case of depression," "" "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors cause one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, who has a herniated disc, can be bad, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to ponder on everyday problems and worries, Weeß will give an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to relieve the sleep problem, it is important to find out what causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly a resident sleeping physician in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medicine centre at the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, one should first contact the family doctor in case of sleep problems, advises Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep lab, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examination in the sleep laboratory, medical doctors, for example, advise snoring with breathing placements, in case of sick daytime fatigue, in case of sleep transducers or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disturbance, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please don't make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After covering, one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose goggles, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera records the sleeping-ends on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which you can apply for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß will count on: regular sleeping and standing times, not too long in bed, don't watch TV to sleep, avoid watching TV and don't look at the watch at night - then you start counting immediately, and that's quite and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a couple of linden trees, in between still a rest cobblestone pavement: the Riga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't seem so at first sight, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from east to west, one passes by playgrounds, a fresh-knitted kindergarten and a bioladen.</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone "ugly!" has sprayed on the facade of a grey house.</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite to a Lidl, which is to be demolished in the near future, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in recent weeks, article about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is preferred by burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the inhabitants have leases, but on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the inner senator Henkel has spoken out several times for a hard action by the police against the project, which referred to the area as a "no-go-zone" for police and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After evacuating the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, the police patrol three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team-men on site, blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, construction workers were renovated in order of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later police and construction workers withdrew from sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others converse in front of Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who holds three children here, are generalized above all by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the residents of the house projects they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who mostly wanted police protection from vandalient leftists.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and the police expose between landowners and their neighbours, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which today, compared to the rest of the city, has a low average income and high poverty-risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, many houses were occupied in the former GDR, among them nearly the entire Mainz road very close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated by a large police force in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the district has become a magnet for tourists and polliners from all over the world. residents of GDR times and former household occupiers are now sharing their neighbourhood with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them in wooden or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with colour bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year as often along with the words" "" "left-wing violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours consider this as a problem could be that criminality is not necessarily affected by crime: crimes like bodily harm are directed almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes are subject to damage, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years, cannot speak of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is striking: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, they were definitely not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has been consciously drawn into the streets of Riga - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was also so important that the residents get their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer the street will continue to be taken away: by faceless new buildings in former building gaps that the old residents displace.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "this is ultimately condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people living here are rather people who don't feel so well," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I absolutely can't approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for engenders who are angry about color bombs: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who prefer should be aware - just like someone who runs into a pub area that can badly complain about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented with first names have asked not to be named with their correct name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new Commissioner for Refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the Commissioner for Refugees in Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social educator supports the team of the administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact person for all stakeholders: refugees, working group refugee assistance, administration, authorities and anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine's client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is here now, the eiving Wollmilky, who has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus, some - less mocking than rather on the multitude of desired tasks - meant purposefully, as the administration wanted to write out the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">Searched for was an administrative force with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a daunting Wollmilky.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not her central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "said Regine client, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be available in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Municipalities are responsible for the termination of the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must place the refugees in your own or hired living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the administrative office to the commune and the Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it does not work, so it is necessary to rely on private dwellings, such as Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "therefore, common apartments must be intimidated as it is so beautiful." ""</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the washing line.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be undone or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine client.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house master, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no occupational therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean labour.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So special offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">Administration and honorary members also jump here.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is central that the refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "you must explain to the refugees that it is just a long time and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever would eventually develop the feeling that he could no longer help in Urbach, do not work, and be useless, he will never integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are also problems, customers tell honestly, "people with whom nothing works." the work of Deuschle and customers is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: have the two fears of radicalisation after recent occurrences, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine tells customers quite clearly," "" "what some naive might call." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins would get them completely out of sight.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "said Regine client." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honorary members must look for activities on the spot and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always been in the background that soon a new shock to refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">The policy is afraid to answer this question clearly.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine client also makes it clear that the Urbachs are already busy to integrate the present people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
