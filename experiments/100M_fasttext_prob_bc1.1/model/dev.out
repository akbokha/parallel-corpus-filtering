Obama Rec@@ ei@@ ves Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the deb@@ ated two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal struck by Barack Obama on Iran &apos;s nuclear programme has wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
in March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not agreed with Obama , but a meeting was rejected with an indication of his upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call Professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house officials found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where according to the police he shot and killed a popular historical professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said Lamb did the fatal emergency call after@@ ward .
until the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took his life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb was motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal background story .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students visited classes of both .
at the same time there were some tendencies to problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to have a lau@@ dation for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion that Lamb had worked so hard for him would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic way to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus police found Lam@@ bs lane later when he drove again into Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson said .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city of about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , teaching Ge@@ ography and Ped@@ ago@@ gy .
he did his doctorate in spring in pedago@@ gy .
one of Lam@@ bs &apos;s long@@ time friends described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar playing .
he was the s@@ warm of women at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls melt away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , 40 and living in the Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and P@@ enti@@ ss apparently had some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house bor@@ dering a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of P@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail met both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
P@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he Lamb and P@@ enti@@ ss Night last night on 5th September , after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were on the way up and j@@ oked with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , headed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
around 900 people , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community , participated in a candle light memorial service on Tuesday evening at the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt were also part of the vi@@ gi@@ l , while the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we are trying to move our students back , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebec@@ ca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb opened the emergency call after he shot Schmidt and that in his emergency call he called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
Toys R Us says that it won &apos;t be so many Christmas season workers like last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it is planning to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres all over the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 45@@ ,000 employees were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that this month it will start with interviews and the number of employees will rise from October to December .
while the holidays themselves are still months away , the Christmas business is getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equip shops with employees selling , shipping , and delivering products .
Michael J. Fox shi@@ r@@ ds over his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theater waiting for the Ro@@ y@@ als , and I realise that the seat is empty next to me , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to mind that I &apos;m a simul@@ ated y@@ awn and an arm length of being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The biggest travel film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cin@@ emas in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon said his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution to the conflict that lasted almost five years , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN leader calls on all parties , including the UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
B@@ an told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , the United Kingdom and France on the fr@@ inge of the meeting of ministers of the General Assembly this month in order to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values demonstrating that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from upper ranks in poll@@ s down , it doesn &apos;t work ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to ask themselves seriously what it means for the chances of nom@@ in@@ ating the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys led his lead to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom only won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ um@@ ps staying power and start to let their dollar flow to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values indicating that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University revealed that only two of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures stand in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac voting in I@@ owa announced last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; delighted &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of ten say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anger@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing about enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ cans don &apos;t see Tr@@ um@@ ps tem@@ per as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , says ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 per cent think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his tem@@ per did not fit into the White House , according to ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their scholars , Republi@@ can voters think that Tr@@ ump is real .
when asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week , four out of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change from the time when four of the ten end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the final cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it is clear that a variety of GO@@ P voters look at Tr@@ um@@ ps Camp@@ a@@ ign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans were gathered for another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still propos@@ ing almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is diff@@ use to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps the majority support .
he has ahead of Charlie Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally in front of Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans say they have formed their mind .
a recent survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have firmly forgiven their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say that you never change your mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
however Tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for tr@@ ump .
six out of ten Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two months ago , immigration and fishing were in public discourse until 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic manner of dump crucial His@@ pan@@ o Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ ori@@ tis@@ ation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ pol@@ l from Monday , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , it seems to be Donald Tr@@ ump .
the fru@@ stration over the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of ten Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer to have a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are mad at Washington too .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa 2 weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here you can find the most expensive urban@@ ization - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a roof @-@ roof@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the supply of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular layers one square meter is the most cost .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residen@@ ces , however , one of the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
Engel &amp; Völk@@ l &apos;s real estate service provider has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residen@@ ces - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro per square meter , well recorded .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at its head here exceptionally .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double door cont@@ actor in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky strike by Thomas Müller showed the way to FC Bayern to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympic Games Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e presented a dream start to FC Bayern in the witch &apos;s seat of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to reach the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
at his 28th matches in the Champions League on the Bavarian Leadership , Müller was rewarded with the help of Olympi@@ ac@@ os tor@@ ment@@ alist Roberto , who made a shot of the world master thought to be a flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Phil@@ lip L@@ ah@@ m promised before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea , without gl@@ it@@ tering .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his latest six home games in the premi@@ er class , including famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund proudly stum@@ bled here ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , un@@ defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but often too vain for their offensive efforts .
the attacks have often been initiated by reloc@@ ating to left @-@ wing Douglas Costa , which was rarely passed on to the former O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k hit the right half @-@ field in the upper left corner of the square .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion awarded the potential 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in the first half had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Brown reached Poland &apos;s head ball from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct taking the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians recorded their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could put con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous con@@ i@@ fers .
but on go@@ al@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er was divor@@ ce .
so for example , when he ste@@ ered a shot of ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
recently , Guardi@@ ola painted a four @-@ chain link with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who did it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside .
the World Cup hero had given the green light after finishing the qualifying session , said sports board Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski who had been slaugh@@ tered ( 59 . ) .
Götz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller added another one .
in front of the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bavaria fans in their spect@@ ator block apparently provoked the supporters of Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with bat@@ ons against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan has been injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
if you smoke , you will not only harm the lungs but also the teeth - this is what a Potsdam long @-@ term study suggests .
the good news : if you ren@@ ounce , the risk sin@@ ks quickly .
smokers have a significantly higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several staff at the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
tooth decay is main causes of tooth decay and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ va , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphasizes the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent inflammation of the g@@ ums in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
people who quit smoking could , however , reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until the risk level falls back to the level of non @-@ smokers , first author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one has to persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , head of study H@@ einer Boeing from the DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to a good oral health even to a high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by tooth@@ lessness , shared the DI@@ f@@ E .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking reduces the risk of early tooth failure .
the new long @-@ term study supports the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists from Cologne &quot; Rhein@@ u@@ fer on rem@@ n@@ ants of the late Anti@@ quity
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the second time .
near the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings have been excav@@ ated , says museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are looking for so @-@ called soil monuments .
during all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always added as a specialist office for archaeological excav@@ ation .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have now found what they are looking for .
it was already known from text documents that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier .
in addition to the ruins of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 tom@@ bs that probably belonged to the church .
young woman tra@@ cked by freight train
after a young woman is caught up at the train station in the Gei@@ pi@@ er@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ den , the Federal Police asks the population to help .
on early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 a.m. the woman crossed the railway station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train that came from Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
according to the Federal Police , she suffered most severe injuries by collecting the train .
she was treated by medical attention and was taken to hospital by emergency forces .
over the reason of the ni@@ gh@@ tly cross @-@ crossing of the young woman there are no findings to the investigating magi@@ strates .
the incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
local residents or p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by by Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Ziegel@@ bak@@ eries , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) come into question .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
in order to shar@@ pen the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TT@@ IP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current Ar@@ bit@@ ration System .
the controversial private mediation organizations for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its way of functioning clearly corresponds to more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens believe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström on the idea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de has proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced its support .
TT@@ IP addresses the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings stipul@@ ate con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the United States jointly choose independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to the same parts from the EU , the US and from third countries .
for the first time a second instance is planned .
it would allow it to obj@@ ection to judgment .
so far , the parties involved agreed among themselves on arbit@@ rators , there was no obj@@ ection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ ström commented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she intends to work towards an international investment court .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied .
the investor state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , which are mainly demanded by large corporations , are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a type of parallel justice that companies can le@@ verage damage compensation of tax@@ pay@@ ers , le@@ verage national laws , or push through a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act described the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised above all that it should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
on the other hand , the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) described the plans as great progress .
the Commission considered essential points in the reform that the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European Business Federation B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the action of the economy by too many new rules .
it was said that especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the TT@@ IP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the USA so far .
originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year .
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
delicate Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him stands a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ dly working folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about different places he always records on the map , telling about his meticul@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they came into being and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderfully creative mis@@ rer .
with the third album Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State , published in 2003 , clever@@ ly composed songs seem to be very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties but can drift away into great opul@@ ent at any time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ our that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 US states should be sung in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in the near@@ ness of the Rhine already &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
he live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series .
&quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) is a celebrated masterpiece in 2005 .
exu@@ ber@@ ant ideas and styli@@ stic sophistic@@ ation .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no annual list of influential music media .
after highly productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively in electronic spare parts .
this sixth full studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but played by programmable sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and rever@@ b .
long ago the smaller clubs arose , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on @-@ head@@ bands and big fluorescent stage decoration .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
in the dark @-@ kept ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests sit in their chairs now , the much stri@@ ped St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; record in essence . &quot;
first of all St@@ ev@@ ens expresses his hum@@ ility , plays acousti@@ cally a few older songs and finally dec@@ lines with thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ aire
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut with the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ ings is eag@@ erly awa@@ ited
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is expected to make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questionnaire and first meet David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to make the first of his six pre @-@ determined questions shortly after mid@@ day , with his performance probably being tested by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s lead , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cab@@ inet@@ ts and his speech at the TU@@ C convention on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration ceremony marking the 7@@ 5th anniversary of Battle of Britain &apos;s National An@@ them on Tuesday provoked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the centre of several titles in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadows ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are referring to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party initially supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acking within Labour , following Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation in profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour made changes in order to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow worker and pensions minister , said the party was &quot; very clear , &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26.@@ 000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he &apos;s T@@ ory boss in the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament .
the Labour leader , who has promised a different policy approach , says he has called &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 stimul@@ i .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s question@@ ings are too con@@ front , and that he will be subjected to both &quot; skill &quot; and stri@@ kers and instead focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister , will represent him if he doesn &apos;t participate - for example when Mr Cameron is on the road abroad .
he also initiated the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokesperson of the company , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to withdraw from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch and Ju@@ dy show , &quot; often associated with the prime minister &apos;s question@@ er . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the prime minister was considered the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the Lower House and its position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and has need of far @-@ reaching reforms .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pound increases by accelerated salary growth in the United Kingdom &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pound was br@@ anded in terms of data indicating an increase in wages growth in the United Kingdom . at the same time , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid goal SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July the result without Bon@@ uses in the UK increased by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and brought app@@ rais@@ al at the time of an increase in interest since 2009 .
the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover bid was received by the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods , Bur@@ berry Shar@@ es were 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again reported growth .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core climbed 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by a stock sale as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had put his appreciation for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports loan company reported a pre @-@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the head of J@@ D Sports claims that higher wages end@@ anger growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os at first .

PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leban@@ ese to a potato d@@ öner idea
potatoes or twe@@ et@@ ers ?
both - and in the potato d@@ öner , developed by Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ hor@@ ny owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay .
inspired by the saying &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay has put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ ewer .
the idea led him to a pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner , &quot; which he had seen on television .
since then , in his shop , a barbecue sk@@ ewer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is mul@@ ticul@@ tur@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea has meanwhile been submitted to the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
for this reason , Al@@ hay doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y how much meat and how much potatoes are the sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash Beg@@ ins So@@ ver@@ eign@@ ty @-@ Camp@@ a@@ ign to Fi@@ ght Al@@ di@@ - On@@ ce
Met@@ alli@@ c tries to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a fund@@ raising campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , metal and I@@ GA supermarkets will strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A traders and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA outlets and shop@@ keepers who sell cheaper tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ alli@@ c will be releasing additional details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices performs its annual investor strategy day .
it is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s &apos;s I@@ GA retail business and generate higher profit margins as the Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut around five percent of the food market in these two states after opening its first markets and take away from all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that I@@ GA retailers could lose $ 360 million in revenue per year and met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss of food and food business and high fixed costs in Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s could cost a $ 13 million profit before interest and taxes , &quot; Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ alli@@ st loses market shares in eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley noted that Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , said at a business lunch in Melbourne , that met@@ cash is likely to disappear within a decade .
met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of directors of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ Gas market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s Food and Food Trading , accounting for about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , have fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction of operational debt in terms of pressure on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler rep@@ lies and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to pay for sale prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA individual retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and providing a better selection of private label foods .
met@@ alized CEO Ian Mor@@ rice say that the price adjustments and charging schemes of El@@ an are going to grow and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ um and ear@@ ns praise rather than criticism for his own behaviour according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special C@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with the not@@ orious analysis of K@@ yr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon thereafter , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison called out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka had to beat K@@ yr@@ gy@@ z and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was recently watched as he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a crash sh@@ ook a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is von He@@ aly was defended .
the Teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against the UK .
&quot; one thing I en@@ vious about is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a bit into the argument , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost a ra@@ cket in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke a bat out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with other players , he is well trained in form , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider K@@ yr@@ gy@@ z the important decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed component to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the contro@@ versy around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick was very quick to climb what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climb@@ s in the eyes of the public , and he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . I think it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency , closes the border , holds refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency and sever@@ ed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who were trying to get illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a state of no @-@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indignation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ vers over them , the migrants chant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian government police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary were sent back while more and more came from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days talks with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border had no common immigration policy after the 28 @-@ year @-@ block at a conten@@ tious meeting in Brussels .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the ump@@ teenth Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria urged on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes for a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or its neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency stand out on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so they could shut down streets and speed up asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans the construction of a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after it has ended a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were used to build the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East , and has become an entry point to the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the coming economic refugees are seeking a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) high fence , which the government built along the southern border with Serbia turned into a crime . these laws also set higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokesperson Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it is very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the military use of the military , expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities wanted 45 people to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are attempting to repair the fence fast .
Hungarian officials joined two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos circul@@ ated the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to crowd into it .
about 20 managed to come in , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national survey
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton still holds a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face towards the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the voters in the pre @-@ election ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say their opinion is certain which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders earned some profits .
Clinton has a major lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these advances have decreased .
your support for the men has decreased significantly , and S@@ anders is only back here with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s benefit in democratic voters less than 50 years has dissi@@ p@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
but Clinton is still ahead of the senior voters .
last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries nationwide say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are thri@@ lled by her .
the views are more mixed with those who don &apos;t currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their peak candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it is time that a woman president is appointed ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters are also mentioned by Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with problems and elec@@ tors are also cited .
as the vice @-@ president th@@ rows a potential for the presidential office into the balance dish , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if Democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
more than half of Clinton &apos;s supporters say that their second choice would be far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to fight for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is increased before S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure dropped from 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ den is by far a second at this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; selectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important with a candidate , Democratic elec@@ torate call on the question of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similarly as last month no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters of the prim@@ aries stands out as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates perform good results in some important tra@@ its with voters of the prim@@ aries of their party .
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
bi@@ den best cuts the three candidates with hon@@ esty while Clinton &apos;s strength is leadership .
thirty percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
in general , democratic voters in the prim@@ aries also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , roughly one @-@ quarter of the voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as Minister of Foreign Affairs continue to be made , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say they have not influenced their opinions altogether .
but it &apos;s a different story in the American public overall .
half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third are satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion has wor@@ sen@@ ed from it .
they are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six out of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the constitu@@ ents of their party , this remains a problem for them among registered voters altogether : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 per cent of the voting rights do not consider it an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time 55 percent of the eligible voters will see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good marks in leadership .
among the six candidates we tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best cut off with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tr@@ ump in nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son finds himself closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest survey by C@@ BS News / New York Times
in the meantime , half of the voters &apos; support in the new survey has now been om@@ itted , and others are losing a dramatic stake
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . support is growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS pol@@ l conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump among republi@@ can elec@@ torate with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Ch@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , was beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell at the lowest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio res@@ ide at 6 % in third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey released last week shows that Car@@ son increases in surveys - he lands at 19 % support among the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent pol@@ l of ABC News / Washington Post also showed tr@@ ump well ahead of Car@@ son .
with a view to a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found several si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ques@@ tioning Tr@@ um@@ ps faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tr@@ ump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa .
pleasant swimming temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are only measured in the distance , bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers already have a trip to the Mediterranean to find even hot water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short enjoyment at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go to the sea : the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , dividing the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
on the other hand , bath temperatures also offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood poll@@ uted with the death of Bar@@ uch College new@@ bie
almost two years after a student passed away during a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder accus@@ ations were lod@@ ged against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police reported .
officials said he had been loaded with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches and then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g became impot@@ ent and claimed an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to contact his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to seek advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point the members began to hide utensils and basically made the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood about Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly attached to the head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs with bl@@ unt strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ anes of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment due to murder of the third grade for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of har@@ ass@@ ous attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we not only want to be responsible for the persons involved but if there is an organization that sanc@@ tioned it - officially or in@@ official - we will also be held ac@@ coun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local community .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
an increase in interest is coming , and the land@@ se is stag@@ ger@@ ed , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know that .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only minor instructions on how to proceed .
a recession came within just 11 months following the first rate increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments are responding .
hence , representatives of the US central bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on raising interest rates , but rather on the period needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of an increase in interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal al@@ ti@@ tudes , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some sectors of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
once the increase arrives , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that property yields will be reduced 12 to 24 months after the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what has happened after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market has been in the past 35 years mostly in the upward trend - approximately 14 percent - on the way to interest rate rise , rather flat in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average yield in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average yield in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with a recent analysis that Bob D@@ oll , Head of Plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s published .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return thus begins to l@@ essen .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that could not happen before and which could accelerate a recession .
what is most remarkable is that the gross domestic product is near its lowest point at an interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases have only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all eyes were focused at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading only accounts for 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all growth cycles of 1950 to now have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ iting heights were put in the shadow very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
fixed income was volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than stocks if they change their strategic course .
when bonds the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond @-@ endi@@ cks immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will result in returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , mixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones says that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , len@@ ders have expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens their strategy .
in large and whole , companies that handle the greater part of their business in the United States will benefit if interest rates increase and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts will get worse , as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market , and the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate rise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet out@@ performed 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a major problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , &quot; Gold@@ man said .
outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits through higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are just how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Euro MP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of Parliament critic@@ ised the station because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; into Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading MP and puts new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also told the BBC @-@ boss that the public broad@@ ca@@ ster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from his commercial ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be The Br@@ its just under another name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ing@@ ham said .
BBC @-@ General Director rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was well ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 I will not learn anything else about classical music anywhere else .
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music that is really un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is really important to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Contro@@ lled Alan Dav@@ ey argued that hard work must be made to engage the audience as it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which was under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport , to kick the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet .
the T@@ ory de@@ pu@@ ties Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was produced in a special BBC manner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it launches an entertainment series next time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future , or to lend money to the fee pay@@ er for other entertainment formats .
net sales increased slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the record in 2000
online sales strengthened three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday bra@@ ked the issues in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s major shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
however , experts say that there are signs now that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been evolving over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that comm@@ utes , and we may experience that growth will be less@@ ened .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
experts believe that purch@@ as@@ ers hold their purchases in front of this event , which takes place last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers took care of their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 was spent a little more than £ 1 online .
for some products , such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims bury the killed in Mec@@ ca during crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first funer@@ als in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia temporarily susp@@ ects the collapse of the giant Saudi Bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane fell
hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s wholesale mos@@ que .
mour@@ ners filled , largely dressed in white , the way to pay their respect when the first of the dead came their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the procession went over to the holy site , where only days before a building crane stood by the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell on the bed .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral when the Saudi King had a sanc@@ tion over the bin Laden &apos;s construction company due to the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 injured .
the bodies of 29 operators who were killed , when a crane rus@@ hed through the Large central mos@@ que of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead there was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane fell .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already said that the h@@ add@@ ling will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden group would not have stopped the crane &apos;s arm when it was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree issued by the state Saudi Press Agency said the bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company was out@@ law@@ ed .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which rus@@ hed into a courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later took place this month .
the Bin Laden Group has issued no statements on the breakdown of the Cran@@ s , and their representatives were not available for a comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ ored the Group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected with the Saudi royal family for decades and takes over larger projects .
the late leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a revol@@ ting son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the collapse of the crane was in the midst of strong winds and rain , only few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people stay in hospital .
government representatives ordered that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently wounded .
others will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Bos@@ s says that the time of cheap Eastern European arti@@ sans is over
British increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe has sur@@ ged
this means that 200 other pre@@ fix shops target@@ ing professional tra@@ des@@ people will be opened
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets across the country
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that the British put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified East European arti@@ sans who carry out work in their home .
if you can deal skill@@ fully with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to belong to a minority these days .
the British increasingly employ arti@@ sans to perform DIY jobs in their homes , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new CEO of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Bau@@ markt chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe , who offer services at low prices , is now over@@ hau@@ led .
therefore King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 new scre@@ w@@ fix shops dedicated to craftsmen and to close 60 sales points from B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the shop are being hit by women .
at the moment the men predomin@@ ate .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households who do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this stronger towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of the UK &apos;s FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ designed their top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .

officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball championship runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and tax ev@@ asion .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them had also been accused of abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted by this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial has been postpon@@ ed .
according to At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary examination , the accused had cryst@@ alli@@ sed that in the years 2006 to 2011 , the def@@ end@@ ants used funds from accounts that they were allowed to disp@@ ose of in their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 Euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports officials are also charged with financial off@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was eliminated by the Chair@@ woman of the Sho@@ v@@ eller Senate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
in order to blame the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that the association did not have a financial disadvantage at any point in time .
the sports officials only accounted for expenses and had invested the sports club , for which they had invested a lot of time and money in which they invested a lot of time and money - the Pas@@ si@@ va contracted around 600@@ ,000 sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; back then we were faced with the situation : do we continue to run the club , or do we lock ? &quot; one of the def@@ end@@ ants told us , in the Brot@@ z profession , the chief inspec@@ tor of the financial department .
he then decided to take over this task with his colleague and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have shot money , put our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said when he was taken up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been agreed with the association : you can freely manage the money , no debt can be made .
furthermore , in the case of corresponding financial success , the payout of the expenses compens@@ ations had been decided retro@@ spec@@ tively by 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expenses compensation was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was on the account .
for this reason , flat and not detailed bookings appeared , the former chairman explained the proceedings .
the accounts and savings accounts managed the two def@@ end@@ ants together , said the second def@@ end@@ ant .
the judge asked why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed in detail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association didn &apos;t care about financial support , important was only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , when a function@@ ary investigation began due to official abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the Club &apos;s account .
these were set@@ backs , the def@@ end@@ ants declared .
this securities account was based on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and was not known according to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not answer for a long time .
then he finally thought he believed that this was the best for the society .
if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor stepped into the room .
the accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this refer@@ ral was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Property Request &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know why compensation claims .
wher@@ eu@@ pon the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation because the association was never damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are all of the tailor with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never paid a cent salary , he merely calculated o@@ dom@@ eter money and di@@ ets .
on di@@ ets he charged the club 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the def@@ end@@ ants could not show exact documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept after an operational check , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
the second def@@ end@@ ant also referred to the mil@@ eage .
he explained in his statement that he had to go to the bank to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence .
the trial will continue on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard joins another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the workforce reduction , which has been ongoing for three years , further jobs will be disman@@ tled in the future when the company spl@@ its .
the addition of the US @-@ Compu@@ gi@@ ants Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) has no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning the reduction of 25,000 @-@ 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division .
as a result , costs in the amount of 2.7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mining of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP had some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard shares declined 2.3 percent .
the company , which has become a large corporation from California &apos;s Pal@@ o Alto , is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and print business is to be bund@@ led even more in a new society - apart from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business units are to be listed on the stock exchange .
another dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand of corporate customers for its services , last followed the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the proceeds went back in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP answers with a spl@@ itting up and massive positions on the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man first re@@ acted to the fact that customers are increasingly purchasing smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and getting more and more businesses online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans fores@@ ee a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
but a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mainly be rejected : 54 per cent spoke against it , and 35 per cent were cons@@ enting .
the fact that other countries fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
on the other hand , 24 percent are to intervene in the conflict .
a co @-@ operation with the Syrian authorities , Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , declined 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent of them .
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th IAA

after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show on Thursday under the motto &quot; Mobility connects &quot; on Thursday .
the general public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
as two years ago , the organisers of the V@@ DA Auto Association expect some 900@@ ,000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : breaking of violence at the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have deployed at the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Wasser@@ werfer on several hundred abandoned refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police there was a police line and a wat@@ cht@@ ower was standing behind the police .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officers initially inhal@@ ed pepper spray .
after that the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now retired from waiting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees gathered in themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ man of the Serbian police also suffered injuries through the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world is watching when the US staff comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make an important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey of 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , which was still the last week of the opinion that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates on the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will hold .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank could potentially leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel Kar@@ bide , Managing Director at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global conditions .
she warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the chances of such a move are good .
the decision should be made at 20.00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death guards at the Delta State University ap@@ ologi@@ zed for exc@@ uses
after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted , &quot; he couldn &apos;t do it , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer in ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has shot on someone , and one is killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb advised the staff of the emergency call centre to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give it .
lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
as police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to und@@ o it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen rang him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , Lamb said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said that she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were their daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , Lamb called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He won &apos;t go to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police arrived on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville late this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. in spring 2015 from Delta State University , as his life lau can be found on the University &apos;s website .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is building the Group around
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organisation .
150 of the roughly 1000 leaders around the world will cost the work of the Group .
however , with the pilot trade union , there are new negotiations .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evaluating Eu@@ row@@ ings &apos; cheap subsidiary .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syn@@ ergi@@ es , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will no longer be a member of the Executive Board for the passenger business .
the cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independent as possible .
in future , CEO Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for Eu@@ row@@ ings .
with the new order Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of annual turnover of 30 billion euros .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic of talks should be the retirement control for pilots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predic@@ tive record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wanted to achieve stable results as quickly as possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline led to several strikes in the past few months .
in addition to the pilot &apos;s supply of the pilots , background is the &quot; Wings &quot; savings concept .
in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa puts out routes to the group &apos;s own budget line Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left outer Defender to weeping and closing it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w had broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg structure and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operates in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy coming to Manchester United with 18 , it has very hard and then plays fantas@@ tically , and then it happens .
in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double treatment then it takes six months and it won &apos;t play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be able to escape the Red Card and the Sus@@ pension of a El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee was mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a mo@@ m and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat at PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the England advoc@@ ate has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June .
Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very serious injury . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Dutch team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very serious injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .

surely David Cameron knows better The Lor@@ ax ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister chose The Lor@@ ax , the environmental label published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on Super@@ Camp@@ s website , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my kids , because it always seems to give a picture or message we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron re@@ port@@ edly describes the plot of the book , instead re@@ stores a content of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text .
&quot; among the walled city of Th@@ an @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , by listening to her desire to see a real tree , &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if that wasn &apos;t enough : the text presented by Cameron reads partially like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ an @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the story of the book . here an un@@ named boy hears how the local environment is ra@@ v@@ aged by the gre@@ edy , trees @-@ prone , thu@@ ya @-@ bear@@ ded creatures , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times consec@@ u@@ tively to a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said the lyrics were probably coming from Cameron &apos;s voting bure@@ au .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but gave no further comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not exclude an ou@@ tra@@ geous victory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page is perhaps less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ punch and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown quantity at test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ re leaves the UK test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ re is , of course , difficult to analyze as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that pocket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , the barrel of Ly@@ th could have been extended , but he had control over his own destiny .
hopefully , if he goes out further for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude even if he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and that didn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his character is difficult .
ly@@ th got seven chances - such as Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first introduced Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ re was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a drummer , whom I highly recommend .
he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw early in Yor@@ k@@ shire when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
it must have at least the same chances as those before it , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of leaving Mo@@ een beside Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bowl and get four Qui@@ cks , emerged , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this lef@@ ty has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he made three hundred re@@ ins strai@@ gh@@ ta@@ way and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari arrives in the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made some clever additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advis@@ er to the test games could be a coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , because he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh air , even if the news is in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ins te@@ amm@@ ate Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used in the One Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team cre@@ ators do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .

my European friend , who is looking for outside Britain in the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and let us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point in some capitals , where they don &apos;t care if we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened in the exc@@ essively long endurance races like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a left .
it is difficult to imagine that they are going to break a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be used better to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may not intentionally plan useful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , during the UK &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my boy@@ friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics were the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press microphones in 1975 , but did not support our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ Opport@@ uni@@ sts , who has made a name as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , tel@@ eph@@ ones and the Pseu@@ do Non @-@ In@@ länder , who own most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about them , but realized that when you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , you &apos;d better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum as Bla@@ ir had opposed the principle of the non @-@ adopted EU constitution , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on Monday at Westminster - I told him that he no longer need time for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ y@@ k@@ ott Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &quot; s , an error back then and today .
it may take time but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps &apos;s traditional blo@@ t @-@ off tendency and the wild bo@@ ils of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism may well say yes .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , &quot; but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said when the boy sc@@ outs in him fought , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell as a shadow chan@@ cell@@ or was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ mar &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; stay &quot; under all circumstances - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his comrades and MPs in all the reports on Monday evening on Monday evening .
whatever the touch@@ down bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - breaking news is important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , which allows him to keep our support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in accordance with their B@@ enn@@ ite B@@ enn@@ ant economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all this can be fu@@ tile ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , what I was reminded of when starting Monday , what was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critici@@ ze Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) signed up Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers questioned the resili@@ ence of data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which p@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims were &quot; built on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to produce their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received funding from British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also under@@ lined the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received in advance by the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not provided , but several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes @-@ champi@@ ons , some of which also provide an industry financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco management of the p@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ essed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for most products &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the p@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the alleg@@ ations of p@@ he that &quot; there has so far been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
Professor Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he , said that the claims of BM@@ J have already been re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
p@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative danger compared to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually in an illness related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by showing up @-@ to @-@ date evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national competence .
BBC should abandon East@@ enders , former boss of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for showing publicly @-@ legal programs that are likely to be viewed by a smaller audience in hard @-@ disputed time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from stations such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC CEO , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had been trying to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the top @-@ house communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , what I don &apos;t consider medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least mention programs that others do not do or commission .
they send The Voice over a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded programs that could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ calendar is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
to be honest , other channels would give her right arm .
I am trying to see how this should be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC is to blame for reviews on &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular programmes give what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , proposed in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like the East@@ enders were to sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal &quot; N@@ ine programs &quot; should go to BB@@ C4 but they carry out their tasks , and they can argue that if they go to their apparent missions for the justification of £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has ever seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; comm@@ enting on the radio fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you all think we all think that there is a great value for 150 £ every year , but for people who have a lot of money for the 150 pounds , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday called for the BBC to check &quot; inform@@ ing , educ@@ ating , and maintaining its thi@@ thi@@ an mission . &quot;
he said that only a little of the BBC production would now be formally classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0,1 % on the radio - and she was supposed to &quot; inform , clarify and enter@@ tain &quot; the public television channels in Australia and Canada .
on the issue of partnerships El@@ stone said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the pro@@ ms , by which he said that only a handful of tel@@ ev@@ isions are shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alli@@ ances in order to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they are be@@ amed with sound impulses which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more on this subject : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetic , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the depths of brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that indicates electric impulses in the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles .
the bli@@ sters , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves affect structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ions and are found in the membranes of some of the cube cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as Nature Communications .
in order to create ultras@@ onic @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons wear TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applying ultras@@ on@@ ically to changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ waves and transferred to the worms where they turn on the modified motor neur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with pulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light which has to be sent down to the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass through un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons suscep@@ tible to ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

V@@ C@@ CP &apos;s creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the arms trade fair - by a gang@@ ster of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic shad@@ y company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains stronger through the blu@@ stering with bright colours and animation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is a step by the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .

eight golden rules for living in student halls
eleven years ago , I as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old moved into a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed into eight simple rules .
the entrance to the residence halls reaches from slight nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to chat : people tell where you come from , whether and where you &apos;ve taken Sab@@ bat@@ ee where you &apos;re standing in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly don &apos;t love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest@@ ness , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you wouldn &apos;t talk to , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burnt on fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers were .
let people leave .
people &apos;s rooms often turn into drinks reception , film night event venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people wear and wear their under@@ wear .
related : don &apos;t forget to start a relationship at university
intro@@ ver@@ ted will receive a rough treatment at the university .
their room should be a refuge but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ mel culture which is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in cultivation allows you to say : &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy that I have spent on interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted of con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student halls had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship through baking .
since you start the university at the high point of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have baked something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering home @-@ made goo@@ dies is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain yourself and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poorly mixed cl@@ um@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat make people feel sleep@@ y when you drop .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check that with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say they serve themselves , even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with that more balanced than my room@@ mate , adding a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise , which keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb you belong to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors if it was something for them to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before pl@@ ot@@ ting her own music , shut down her door and went to her three @-@ hour examination .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move in to the same student residence ?
on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing if you have a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , go to them , dis@@ connect and then see them every day and maybe experience how they all come across all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to say a bit of reason to your abdom@@ en .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys lying in his not locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
lock your door , and place your keys in a glass of water which you put in the freezer - but stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling not more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single persons , low @-@ income ear@@ ners
real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner is building in central Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental town@@ houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need housing , but also the educ@@ ating mother and the low @-@ wage ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I show you how to build cheap and good today , &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds in a project in row houses for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people remain here to a great extent .
in view of the refugee flow , we also need enough housing in the decades to come .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
guil@@ d : a terra@@ ced house needs a minimum of space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when people are accommod@@ ated in blocks of houses .
each of the six houses that are being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees say it is again peace , I go back .
then the houses can be converted easily according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have correctly mig@@ rated my project .
especially complicated it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sword Sonder@@ bau and the Pit@@ ch Ord@@ in@@ ance .
sp@@ ook@@ y .
it is still under@@ estimated , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is space for it .
and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury homes for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not true .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true is true : over the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but it was built of luxury apartments that can hardly afford to afford more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need housing .
not only refugees , but also the only educ@@ ating mother or the poor @-@ ear@@ ner .
I show you how to build still cheap and good today .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; founded three months ago , has added another member to his ranks , thus increasing the membership to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen near K@@ ur .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation made by Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot afford the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent finding are also to be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his solidarity with the spa town .
district office looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ di and the old centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened up a new stop at Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to consulting , you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was opened there recently .
here , directly next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and advice @-@ seek@@ ers now receive information on questions such as nursing care or services of health and nursing staff .
for years we have been setting up our ambul@@ ant care service that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in@@ frequently many insurance benefits are not used because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new landlord J@@ utta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and Bürger@@ hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ di was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or a physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment can be used .
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ di complement each other ideally .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; explains Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ di .
the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both business leaders in particular in demographic change .
because this makes a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure necessary in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined with the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association of old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers in the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able get @-@ together . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

men beating a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ or@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were walking on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ or@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed , according to the police , his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men shou@@ ted to the young man and hit him with his fist .
the victim suffered a breaking of the nose and bleeding strongly from the nose .
when his two friends rus@@ hed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he left his victim .
the wounded young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car right up to their apartment and demonstr@@ atively drove past several times .
when you no longer saw the vehicle , the injured person went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
under the help of a dr@@ um@@ stick , one checked on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured had to be brought to hospital for medical treatment .
up to now there is only a vag@@ ue article description .
one of the men was about 1,80 meters .
the second ra@@ cket was supposed to have been 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice in field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen .
the mayor , Bernd Bor@@ mann , is also the mayor of the industry , U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places in the country there are missing doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : there Dr. Frank Müller succ@@ eeds in the field breaks practice on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his side in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until he has invested 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises on St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the field aus@@ ens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who is currently completing her specialist training at the Dresden Hospital and also wants to enter into practice next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mill@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ an@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I simply called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Müller couple liked the idea of pursuing their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clos@@ eness and constant contact to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also sees to be his own boss .
and so one agreed that the mill@@ ers bought the house with practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller also grew up , followed his medical studies in Hannover , followed by stations in several medical practices and in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a senior emergency doctor in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in a voluntary service in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
while the surgeon operates Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ce@@ ausen as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Internal Medicine ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mill@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a general practitioner .
&quot; so the end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ onic tests as well as long @-@ term and load EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
in the framework of a subsi@@ dy programme from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) , the rub@@ b@@ ish bin@@ der receives a subsi@@ dy of 50,000 Euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice will continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses Austrian citizen Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come to practice in the field of field breaks , and in the average German average there are about 500 .
there is another doctor &apos;s practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ is@@ ausen , the Phar@@ m@@ acy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor had found her , she would have gone too .
those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos;s office hours , by the way , continue to look at familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the fel@@ lows .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the medical professionals have practiced for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen re@@ members smiling .
she already felt a little melanch@@ oly after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I &apos;ve always pushed myself before gar@@ dening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave refugees through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain upright in parallel .
it is still clear that anyone who wants to ask for asylum would also &quot; of course &quot; make it &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot;
the care and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , neither across the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to send incoming refugees towards Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , er@@ ect cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Minister of the Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary , the border with Croatia was already heavily controlled as the border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slov@@ ene does not want to shut down its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ y Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees in the night @-@ hours had already tried to arrive in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could pick it up in the near corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik constantly inv@@ ests police vehicles with new refugees .
it is primarily a matter of Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in action .
in the coming days , his country reck@@ ons with around 4000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo were led to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously led migrants to the Hungarian border , re@@ directed to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade Government denied that it was to propose people to take certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , there was in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the way off the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary did , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could in fact lead to a somewhat far@@ ther west route for the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary , already predicted by ob@@ servers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not refer to details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen Member had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
follow strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 and since then the EU partners have consistently testified to the country as regards the standard of border controls .
on Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed completely .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried Wednesday early to calm a local eye in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be about very high refugee figures at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise Mig@@ rants to - Dan@@ gerous - Alternative Rou@@ tes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already started distributing maps on which alternative routes are drawn by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
people do their err@@ ands , partly fast pac@@ ing , partly comfortably bum@@ bling .
they control the two stations of the Mannheim aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep urban railways .
puls@@ ating , colourful life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle four big boards each with the heading &quot; Before I die .... &quot;
with this action ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce atten@@ tively drew attention to its 20th anniversary and is faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid is also available to the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by for questions and talks like the volunteer staff .
while some p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by spontaneously reaches the chal@@ k and reads the sentence about &quot; my life , &quot; others can read , &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not long suffer , &quot; others stay briefly , read , say pro@@ positions like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then proceed .
over and over again , there are little discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that some@@ time the end will come to this world , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband bear@@ ers of the ec@@ umen@@ ical trousers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why this public @-@ effective promotion is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the fact that not everyone wants to express themselves publicly on the boards is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the topic of death and death is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has greatly contributed to the opening of people .
an app@@ rais@@ al that shares An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid .
the death and mour@@ ning companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted by personal experiences with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid was seeking volunteers by calling , she immediately contacted us and was present at the founding in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the person concerned and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Sankt Vincent .
all of them are meticul@@ ously trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with her job and experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another commodity , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free and non @-@ con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of health insurance funds and donations from relatives and associations allows training as well as training and supervision of the funeral and funeral atten@@ d@@ ants .
training courses for new employees are offered every two years .
the boards on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protestant Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .

F@@ ed@@ Ex results mixed , financial prospects lowered for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supplier giant lowered its earnings outlook for a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its transport service .
the company also said that she plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by more than 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of $ 10,@@ 40 and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forec@@ asting .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower outlook is due to the price increases , which amount to an average of 4.@@ 9 per cent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher sur@@ charges for heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due to growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; yields sound income if it takes into account the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for vac@@ ations were announced one day later than that of the rival UPS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned US $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which twelve of Z@@ ack Investment Research questioned analysts predicted .
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
analysts predicted $ 12.@@ 23 billion in six of Z@@ ack &apos;s analysts .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has seen a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales to stagn@@ ation in his unit Express shipment .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , net transport sales increased 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self insurance .
the Express Unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices while the result dropped due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in pre@@ market trading , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares sank by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most awa@@ ited meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras Mah@@ o@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it &apos;s time to raise the lead for the first time for almost a decade .
lo@@ oming over them at an end of the adorned , two @-@ story meeting hall is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the leader Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double order from Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by an unprecedented stimulus through the short @-@ term interest rate that is close to zero since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it is growing soli@@ dly , recent tur@@ mo@@ il on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representative anxi@@ ous to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and even just a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , head econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue waiting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which ass@@ ures the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently surv@@ eyed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of raising .
this suggests a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial average reached 21.@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the set this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , she would have to go far in her declaration to calm the financial markets so that she could not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an interest rate would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be needed to increase the sentence .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed looks like full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary impact of much lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world sent together at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial average fell by more than 16 % in May when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would reduce global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , with the Dow being now almost 10 % lower than May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when it is to raise interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy would not have occurred over the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former US staff member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the implications for the U.S. economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved technically in decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous over the last few years .
the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down &quot; its monetary expansion , triggered del@@ u@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reaction on financial market movements that apparently are not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
co@@ ater , approved member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ates interest rate rise , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited appreci@@ able impact on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Lack@@ ner said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives und@@ one these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market crash , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest on interest .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il did not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not think it should wed@@ ge ahead of time .
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often called Thai Cost@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public .
yes , it is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town .

there is even a car division if you need engine oil .
the shop is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the cor@@ rid@@ ors .
if the whole shopping takes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express .
the bar@@ racks ( good and cheap ) in this store is close to the coff@@ ers and has different take @-@ on options .
what &apos;s there : do you need something - something - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .

where it is located : the shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles at the edge of Chin@@ at@@ own and the city center - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original .
parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area , along with other shops and restaurants .
even if the shop is well attended , it is not difficult to find a parking space .
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach with her 74 L@@ ences .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ er home on D@@ ill@@ inger Strasse .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite different than at a proper school .
Rio Grande P@@ edi@@ at@@ ric Car@@ di@@ at@@ ric Society promotes healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to educ@@ ate women in a shock@@ ing manner how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies that su@@ ck at breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates which give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ oric intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher intake of calories is not the only dietary modification that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
Ex@@ cep@@ tions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction proposal for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar panels .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited Turn@@ halle Building at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ park is progres@@ sing step by step : in the latest municipal council session the elabor@@ ated building application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
the Board had previously decided to submit an application for a legal &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; of &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ mit@@ re first and roof over@@ hang &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be constructed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background of the planning , the planned utilization of the roof area for solar systems is : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; said mayor Joseph St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
in the case of &quot; Liber@@ ation , &quot; it was again the roof inclin@@ ation , which for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan - was supposed to be below ten degrees .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because there were no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the development plan with regard to the roof tilt - although the Bern@@ rie@@ der municipal council is usually rather restric@@ tive in the case of exemp@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is not a recurring project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um construction at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
at the cost , some 2.3 million euros are calculated .
subsidies are expected for the promotion of schools and l@@ ati@@ tudes .
in the next step the building application for the 18 x 36 @-@ meter @-@ large hall will be presented to the Federal Council for testing .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of the employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the surprise plans of the county , the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , confirmed this .
however , the Supervisory Board conven@@ es a decision , and it will meet on Wednesday , 23 September .
should the plans be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further existing ward .
the rooms are available .
the employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au will be offered at Wei@@ l@@ heim a workplace , says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
employees are informed about their plans .
the change was initiated by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer hospital since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the lead from October 1 and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this meant a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside .
for the next two years Fischer and his team , if the Supervisory Board cons@@ ents to this , will lead both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ en@@ schaft , which still has 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after nearly 140 years .
so far , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refur@@ bish@@ ment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , assumed that the house , which is owned by the Federal Co@@ al , will hen@@ ce@@ forth be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what I &apos;m closing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is currently a short term care of Car@@ itas and a day hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer for the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , who was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there has not been a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as chief physician for over 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) was threatened with closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ ball of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Leu@@ ven tonight ( 20.@@ 15 hrs ) at the HC is required .
the table leader of the Bundes@@ li@@ ga in Wuppertal is the clear favourite , but there is none occasion for arro@@ gan@@ ce .
in the past season , the bath@@ ers at Bh@@ c drew a painful defeat and got some good things there .
hunting accident with two injuries at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were severely injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a ma@@ ize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters were in action , as the police rus@@ hed .
after a shot of shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .

missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Vic@@ tims of Viol@@ ence
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who had been missing since Saturday .
in inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that young people were killed and their cor@@ p@@ ses were thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who was missing since Saturday , fell victim to violent crimes .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police arrived on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was arrested on Tuesday evening , was also considered to be the suspect , who stated the facts and led the investigation into the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after having come home in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman investig@@ ators initially met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of ques@@ tioning in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces , the suspicion arose against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the presum@@ ed perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ h@@ ausen , where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the Court audi@@ ted the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ p@@ ses in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be presented to the fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him dead to the load .
the further investigation should take place on the closer circumstances of action .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing gap
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking a paid pen@@ ance .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the arriving refugees and j@@ ob@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is now over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens about the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the feder@@ ations of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison : this year 26@@ 0,000 units will be completed in Germany .
thus 14@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
refugees are no longer obliged to live in an initial accommodation after the first three months of their stay .
many then come across the housing market and enter the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed for rent last year .
the negative development of the housing market is , however , not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a deficit in Germany , increasing from year to year .
currently , some 77@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther compl@@ ains , author of the study .
for this reason , many professionals have been living in large cities in a number of chambers .
young adults were un@@ willing to stay longer in &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the noisy on the housing market .
in the large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has dropped again for the first time in recent years .
to solve the problem , the &quot; social housing construction &quot; alliance proposes a re@@ boot .
new incentives should boost social housing construction again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could be dispens@@ ed with on the basic income tax and the basic tax on subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be suspended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , attractive tax depreciation and amor@@ tis@@ ation options are necessary according to the Alliance .
the support programme for refugee shel@@ ters in the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in towns and communities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the approximately 300 million euros had already been retri@@ eved on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the project could even be raised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia are setting a corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , there is practically no going through anymore , as more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb proposes to travel through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nonetheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken to the Slovenian Home Secretary and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following the shad@@ owing of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have been broken down to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV broad@@ ca@@ ster RT@@ L .
Hungary sealed its border to refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws , which came into force the same day , practically render superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated : &quot; you can travel and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police seized the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the neighbouring Croatia .
according to media reports , most of them originate from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came to the Serbian border town S@@ id , both by bus and taxis .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees don &apos;t come across borders .
there are other dangers to this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , after the closure of the border no more refugees arrive after Hungary .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 injured people .
just before closing on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws prescri@@ be the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungary border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years imprisonment and deport@@ ation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; Tran@@ sit Zone &quot; established at the border , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants there are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stayed there .
practically nobody has a prospect of granting asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are said to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean@@ up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected garbage , leaving tens of thousands of people on the road@@ side in recent weeks .
barriers were disman@@ tled and one of the reception centres was rebuilt at the border .
nobody wanted to comment on the purpose of this modification .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reaches only a few refugees .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
however , around 20,000 migrants still remained in the country following government data .
in Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for Germany to continue .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees often met on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy with vac@@ ation@@ ing after the bridge on Sunday when ten people were suddenly standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly closed rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , it was at the end of them in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the edges together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we first made up the unexpected guests , with snacks and drinks .
we said the same , we bring it by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview .
they were very grateful .
a man refused to give a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers switched from an ICE into a regional train direction Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in order to stop at the short notice that rail traffic was set to Germany , but still to try crossing the border .
the regional train was deposited at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest association was soci@@ able with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , days before a two @-@ bridge course spor@@ tily - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending tens of thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping to establish structures that ensure human@@ eness right away at the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp , our Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the position of the Hungarian government into the sphere of national socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chao@@ tic states in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to note that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge facing the ongoing floods of refugees and the coming winter to create decent conditions for protection @-@ seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad looking for 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof Quar@@ ters
Konrad has to do all his hands with the provision of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to issue lod@@ g@@ ings for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already gotten a grip on the chaos in the first open @-@ up centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the housing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday , said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; masterpiece &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 85@@ ,000 quar@@ tering in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are supposed to provide the countries , 15,000 the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a drum without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the national tri@@ b@@ ators .
they would have assured him of creating quarters for the refugees to come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it &apos;s going well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
former VP @-@ Mand@@ ator supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born and clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations also in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen as we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private persons can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter .
yesterday Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency it cannot be that district owners have to respect a certain amount of towel holder or size of the duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , in contrast to the Interior Ministry , Konrad is based on his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not give the Republic a cost , as they themselves stated .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the own search for a quarter has not been successful so far .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
however , there are apparently problems with the approval .
Linz calls for better distribution
the city of Linz is planning no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as one can currently under@@ mine those affected without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in case of an emergency other locations should be tested for their suitability .
the head of the city is critic@@ ised for the breakdown of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed off &quot;
in a longer telephone call with Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday corro@@ bor@@ ated further proceedings in the refugee question .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the relevant border controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany will not be available for the time being .
however , the asylum seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany by regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , that now Austria again puts controls on its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the actions of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; general refur@@ bish@@ ment in the industrial line of Linz is officially closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group has moved into S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; in IT , smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; D Group leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he can imagine investing in Star@@ tup @-@ companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later to acquire some .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; D wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at 1.7 million euros , S &amp; T invested 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni propriet@@ or opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
J@@ utta Br@@ eit really wanted to get a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade without further ado : after all , it has now grown in the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which it sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 Euro .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been altered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long considered whether I should open a store , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deciding factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna were impressed by the idea of an own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only people in Linz who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who himself has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has gotten br@@ eit from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women are in rap@@ tures when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag , the expert can not answer with the last certainty .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag val@@ ori@@ zes every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
some people associate this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
whether he mani@@ f@@ ests himself in a foreign hostile attitude , expose journalists or reveal knowledge gaps in international crisis policies - the candidate for the US pres@@ idency s@@ wir@@ ls up the election campaign sharply .
and cuts well with it .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ame Sab@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in the wine @-@ growing village on the wine route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 inhabitants place is related to him over -@@ zig corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del filmed a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous young@@ sters , to which besides Tr@@ ump the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
indeed , there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tends to think that Tr@@ ump is a bit a big mau@@ l , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within a radius , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to High German : the An@@ ders , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
first land purchases in New York were the cor@@ nerst@@ one of the real estate company .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their country in the long run failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ rit , Roland Paul , declared a film start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ ed , this is not so sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was borrow@@ ed Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the wa@@ iter who retired regards the Americans rather distances himself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s always so big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ er Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned , like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family during a visit ended something for the church organ , which is generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he didn &apos;t win the election because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing in the US at the time of his grandfather were like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ o@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not my president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 theat@@ rical go@@ ers , even in the USA the interest awak@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand to the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the D@@ orian Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protective area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the lead in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rus@@ hed to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of leadership in the Liber@@ als , but there were no major shifts in the Today ratings .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival sunrise , with the hosts David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to be no r@@ ô@@ le for Australian TV spectators , as the average number of spectators scor@@ ned 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five capitals , compared to the today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today posted a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
in the past few months Today , Today has closed the gap to Sunrise .
in August , Today , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .

this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial hang@@ ed of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently swe@@ ated father who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics have wonder@@ ed whether Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebec@@ ca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two by The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 pm ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e , gave an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia reached 5@@ 20.000 people on Monday evening and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour .
hot @-@ sea average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the ratios of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ se@@ at will eventually prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that failed to over@@ power the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman at which Sam wood finally landed in The Bachelor was sh@@ rou@@ ded in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked in with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows in the day before from three two , you may have accidentally given a clu@@ e to who will be the winner .
Sam Wood finishes his lips to the final on Thursday
all three women have settled in a ly@@ rical way why wood is the perfect man and in doing so called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , when the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last Rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; their answers could become per@@ ish@@ able who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly named themselves - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies noted , I felt they were quite compatible and I thought it was in the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay thinks she and Sam Wood are well suited as couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made it clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not only a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly tuned to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked for W@@ oods to choose , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the lef@@ to@@ ver girls alike - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Ten PM on Wednesday , 7 : 30 PM .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench when he lost a don@@ or as he did the Aus@@ sie rug@@ by league conver@@ t at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave him the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie George .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the match .
instead of gr@@ ind his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
in his press conference , Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly supported Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers sports repor@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by Special Team Co@@ ordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it certainly wasn &apos;t the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian suite had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said .
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his origin debut in 2007 when a passport at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Free voters call for the employment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ van@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , when there are not new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapse , &quot; Ai@@ van@@ ger said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get uph@@ eav@@ als in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Free State Parliament coalition conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
actually all other main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now also dominated by the free elec@@ torate meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ van@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ van@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as existed during the Yugoslavia wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to push the Free voters away as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is why Ai@@ red@@ ger also demanded more personnel for the administrative courts responsible for filing for asylum : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum arbit@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ van@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern moves away , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more capable of action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the country politics should not fall under the table in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt .
a long lasting torch remains on the agenda : education policy .
for the new school year , the Minister of Education Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test called &quot; Mittel@@ stufe Deutsch &quot; at 47 grammar schools .
but that is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand freedom of choice for all high schools who want to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free travel to G@@ 9 wherever desired .
festive Wall Street helps D@@ ax on the jumps
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German stock market has closed with profits after a long @-@ term , trend @-@ free and nervous course of trade . &quot; &quot; &quot;

solid profits also booked retail locations in London and Paris .
last but not least , the Dow Jones Sustainability Index scored some 1 percent in the US .
many stock markets anticipate that the markets will be on the spot right after the interest rate decision in the US and also for the major deterioration in the fut@@ ures stock exchanges .
the discussion about the burdens arising from the nuclear phase has temporarily pressed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low , leaving deep marks on E@@ on .
according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros in provisions .
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .

4 people killed after police shooting elas@@ tics on prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd of people demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior government official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , casting stones and incen@@ diary bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then poured into the air before res@@ or@@ ting to rubber missi@@ les .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known from which they can kill , which are traditionally used as a less mortal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of K@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces being formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of Th@@ arus , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been involved in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been controlled for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers ha@@ st@@ ened the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional design in Kath@@ mandu , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 m2 area .
a mix of trade , commerce and housing is planned , but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den wants to market an area of approximately 4000 square meters in close proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the premises for a mix of trade , commerce and housing .
you are waiting for appropriate offers , it says on the part of the city .
which investor would be in@@ quired is not yet clear .
nor did any contracts have been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had bought part of the property , which is located at the ring road / corner of the Great Street , already a few months ago bought and the building to be demoli@@ shed .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning for the holiday village at Em@@ den is taking shape .
for the first time , the investor publicly announced plans for the project .
some An@@ gli@@ eger are further wor@@ rying - they fear the sale of their leisure agent .
for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , har@@ med , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday village near Em@@ den are located on the table .
the Inter@@ est@@ ant , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den Company &quot; System Building , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the municipal development committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , which accused the investor and administration sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ended responded to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all the questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the project , which is about ten to twelve million euros , has been in discussion for months .
violent reactions among sea @-@ bush @-@ owners , who had come to the meeting , produced the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , sal@@ tw@@ ater owner and member of the board at the advoc@@ acy of advoc@@ ates , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a giant cla@@ d that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , like several other project critics , he fears that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whole bus@@ loads must come in order for this to happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is happening on the well @-@ known area of the former restaurant , however , is still open .
there is still no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ asing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed the development plans are still variable .

Google launches a double donation campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gle@@ . O ) announced a double donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations seeking to help thousands of refugees to flee the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announc@@ ing the donation call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark railway and bus trips as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desperate for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global donations received up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / has been doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war sh@@ attered Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for overweight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether lightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new J@@ AM@@ A Surgery study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations on type 2 diabetes have proven to be efficient , but most studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight regarding size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of Adi@@ posit@@ as surgery - stomach b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c tu@@ bing - medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this surgery decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments roughly equal to 29 .
among those who underwent a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus dissolved at 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , the diabetes resulted in a complete reduction of only one percent , and in some cases only about two percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; generally better in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surgical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authors found out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by about 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish the mortality rate in five years , thus the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results for the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rek@@ Sot@@ ie group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching greater return in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was about 29 percent less likely to die in obes@@ e people , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study has no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their physicians should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated those genetic changes that have firmly linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love Story plays in the Hun@@ sr@@ ück
it is a subject that is increasingly attracting attention in the fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting especially for Hun@@ s@@ rück@@ er readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ lingen and is pleased that she was able to set up a literary memorial to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accommodate all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama has praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it is only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we have to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and found out that the violent reaction of the US dra@@ gged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase of dis@@ infection by children over the past 4 years
toxic Control Centr@@ es in the USA report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , who swal@@ low heavily alcohol hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of revenues of hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , the toxic control centres report , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children intentionally drink dis@@ infection , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation among the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have supposedly mixed i@@ dis@@ infection with soft mou@@ th@@ wash in order to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of the disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
a few sy@@ ring@@ ers can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning , especially for small children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison centre centre at the hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip around whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently had four inj@@ ections from straw@@ berry fra@@ grant slopes in school , was put into emergency treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold given by an adult as drunk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency medical doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah lam@@ ented their words and was unable to walk when they arrived in the emergency room .
doctors over@@ saw them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and hit her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &apos; mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ infection clo@@ ths and to store the disinf@@ ect@@ ant outside the reach of the child .
in addition to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were linked to fat@@ alities .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario were killed after swal@@ lowing dis@@ infection products containing a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ infection agents and ban@@ ishes it from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the ei@@ fted plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ atter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and pointed out disciplinary actions to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;

I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players look forward to it .
lack of title competition in Scottish football boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic because there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the ran@@ gers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Cel@@ tic games and why ? &quot;
it is because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the ran@@ gers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Cel@@ tic must fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now stands at the top of the table with five points ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before and we &apos;ll come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly - but we have to go ahead .
we really need support from Cel@@ tic because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues which have won &apos;t won the games of this kind either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it increases overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose from 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the National Statisti@@ cal Bureau ( O@@ NS ) showed .
in the meantime , the employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland chose the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .

why I witness an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later today , with the exception of late legal action , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January of his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day came closer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US and there are often more applications available than places available , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma bl@@ amed me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
she admitted that she &quot; could have better form@@ ulate it , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do .
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter for Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that a strong chance is that he is not guilty of murder .
I am sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can apply to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .
man after wet police pursu@@ its persu@@ ades to come from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he persu@@ aded the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he found himself in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police officer who tried to &quot; persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called on Tuesday to create a house peace incident in Becken@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , cous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ches to escape an alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ bi@@ ath@@ lon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy asser@@ ts that ste@@ wards have tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end the racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to end the race immediately .
he was aiming at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed to have launched a personal campaign against him with the late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it comes to the positive cob@@ alt t@@ up@@ shot at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alleg@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach anymore .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
M@@ oo@@ dy had previously made the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department tried to spy out his stall .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy at Rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they seem to believe that I am a che@@ ater .
if that is the case , they should surely believe in their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the opinion that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking it about it .
but now I arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care about it , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s frustr@@ ations have set up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt enquiry and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching told him that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; laugh@@ able , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s debate , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees wrong@@ ly applied mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been like that last night .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it was so on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack at the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know anything about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
det@@ ained by man after the flight of the driver
on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycli@@ st and then a driver &apos;s flight in Cob@@ ram .
the cycli@@ st was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured rider .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes back ri@@ vals for claims about ring fighting
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critici@@ zed the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm players &quot; ring battles &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co Trainer Way@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett did a scar@@ c@@ ely disgu@@ ised re@@ mark to the Storm team after his team had finished the Final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the tac@@ kl@@ ing of his team and said that when tac@@ kl@@ ing , they were only focused on their &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tiques of two leading trainers in his team voice him confident because they were worried that they were worried about being hit by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve never heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focal point , and this has brought us the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it &apos;s funny how this comes up again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy attacked B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St. George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 , St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he &apos;ll take care of a bul@@ let .
but now he has a team that can play and that we consider exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these .
I build stronger faith because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are they p@@ auses and do not give any points of tension ?
for me , it is the game boards .
when they mention us it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm team won this weekend , as they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
bier with 200,000 $ deposit after drug anch@@ or@@ age deposit
a man who could possibly have a life @-@ long punishment because of his attempt to come to the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine che@@ ating to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and landed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ threatening punishment for attempting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless background .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the risk of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained on Wednesday .
in the case of criminal proceedings he lied to the police on his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 as coll@@ ateral to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ ous explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the issue of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and Serbian passport , reports to the police daily and stops at an exit barrier from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tears apart &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to ev@@ ade the left at the last moment , as the police rus@@ hed .
the driver &apos;s cab demoli@@ shed completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed over six hours until 2 PM .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 Euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ st used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when he slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the dor@@ man@@ t Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed their mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research that used terms for the search for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosec@@ utor , E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on , said to Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction - that he was addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people .
he admitted that seeking on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos .
he said that he did it to enti@@ ce her .
he said he was ill in the head when he was drinking , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on shaking and weeping .
she then also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the def@@ end@@ ant with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said the def@@ end@@ ant used computers and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment , to have in@@ decent pictures taken by children on 14 June last year , to viol@@ ate the conditions and not appear before the court at a hearing on 24 March this year .
defense attorney Greg@@ or S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; was found in its off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael passed the verdict until October to get background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted b@@ ail in this case but was kept in custody for court hear@@ ings in other cases .
he was taken into the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
slu@@ ice switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up outside of the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
for fear of discovery and arrest , many slu@@ dges allowed human beings to increase in smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man for the Federal Police .
since Tuesday more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the border river Inn in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they had reached the German side on foot via bridges and wei@@ rs .
there they are received by federal polic@@ emen and forwarded to the registration .
in comparison to the weekly start of the week , more refugees met at the Munich Main Railway Station in comparison to the start of the week .
about 700 people arrived in the capital city alone until 8 : 00 p.m. , a spokes@@ man said in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : expansion of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the south @-@ west expected
meteor@@ ologists warn of storms in the Sou@@ thwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart announced .
the strong low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the &quot; Henry &quot; tropical storm , which has moved from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the past few days .
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , it is still to be expected in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the se@@ abed with bows from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday the sun can be seen again for a longer time .
the mass makes it : every two years the car makers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2015 is mainly a movement among the compact cars , which are currently selling very well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations fell into this segment alone in August , according to the Federal Office of the German Federal Aviation Authority ( KBA ) .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
many new compact models will be introduced this year , among all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel presents an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf , starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines are among the first .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which can be seen at the IAA .
and what will be added to new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault delivers the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively a five @-@ door variant in a conventional and sporty GT version .
he comes to trade earlier next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan de@@ posit@@ ory wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines adapts to the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specification .
the sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe will begin in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact DS 4 compact class model , which can be seen at the IAA .
outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n Ab@@ leg@@ ger presented their hand at the front end : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
the inf@@ otainment system has been modernis@@ ed in the interior , reducing the number of buttons by means of a touch screen and integrates Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play for the first time .
at the IAA in the compact class , there are also a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the ris@@ ed Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human @-@ un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Pen@@ al Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court on a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the persons affected can even hope for money if they were locked in confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man who is now in free walking according to his lawyer had been moved to a larger cell .
his official liability grounds for the un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied arrest warrant against the Land of Berlin failed .
but the Constitutional Ju@@ dges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of App@@ eal and instructed the case for the re@@ examination there .
they see the man &apos;s dignity .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of imprisonment for compensation were decisive , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mu@@ til@@ ation of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of App@@ eal must now clarify the amount of compensation for money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
in April they said a det@@ ain@@ ee for a det@@ ain@@ ee because he was locked in a cell naked .
according to a 2011 decision , the multiple occupancy of a cell without separate toilet is human @-@ worthy .
in addition , Karlsruhe additionally confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had in@@ stituted a deser@@ ted accommodation in a parallel event in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff lived between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case for three months .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had also hit the head@@ lines in recent weeks due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to ra@@ v@@ ages it should already have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Ministry of Justice , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied for young men , 19 are to be dropped by 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what is going to happen in Germany ?
according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees according to Deputy Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following overview shows what is coming to Germany .
according to different progn@@ oses between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are needed each year - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as has been built so far ( 25@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing from rent prices drop out , and in order to find these particularly favourable apartments , refugees will also apply .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding , of currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
this is far too little from the perspective of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing needs to be created annually and the federal government would have to invest a subsi@@ dy of 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
however , scientists and Federal Minister of the Federal State agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction .
according to estim@@ ations of the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany will be able to work in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter critic@@ ises Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but the integration of refugees is crucial if they find work in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the society of admission , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mig@@ rant researcher Dietrich Thr@@ es@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , there has been a political turn in Germany : from the ban on labour for refugees to recognise work .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the Residen@@ z@@ pf@@ licht , the asylum seek@@ ers confined to a place of residence .
in society - even because of the lack of qualified labour - the view is generally en@@ forced that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster .
lack of knowledge of German is a major barrier for access to the labour market .
so far there is not enough offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
the structure of networks is therefore , according to the opinion of Thr@@ es@@ hardt , the royal road to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to Kit@@ as , estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; it is very important for the de@@ pu@@ dent parents to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ zy@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the demand for educ@@ ators rose sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared for classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , Be@@ ate runs from Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that approximately 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no Bundes@@ land asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , the inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has given up his stance .
study willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
for refugees with a reimbur@@ sement of stay or waste do not receive any benefits according to the asylum seek@@ er law more if they begin a study .
the latter generally do not get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ö@@ g@@ authorised persons .
tolerated refugees have had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span shortened to 15 months .
but this gap must also be closed , call for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students were asked to get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively conc@@ ede to Islam the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state churches law will continue to develop into a new state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art relationship .
it would also be important to set up an Islamic welfare organization that takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
rights also include duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to get rid of such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole of society .
as a result , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism is more urgent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has , as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general gender equality law - as a result of European decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it slowly lear@@ ns how the NS@@ U @-@ murder series showed , the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans are demanding for a long time and what international agreements like the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention Germany commit must become a reality in the next few years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is in a position to provide medical care to the refugees so far , says doctor @-@ chairman Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as regards man@@ - power and capacities , we create it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all the newcom@@ ers to hand over health cards .
services rendered could later be settled with the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to feed so many people with the limited catalogue of services that the asylum seek@@ er performance law fores@@ ees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from that , doctors tend to create language barriers .
as yet so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are more poorly informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , but also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over .
many refugees would also be helped with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic look .
among refugees , for example , there are much more un@@ treated disabilities , and the young people are dealing with HIV .
but with the partly different clinical pictures , German doctors come to know about their education , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so hard to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what concerns the lack of medical don@@ or may even be allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians had a sophisticated educational system , and several refugees were even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practise , they would have to prove their qualifications and , if possible , take examinations .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates of the Bund@@ esp@@ sy@@ cho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
they are particularly vulnerable to refugee children , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study conducted by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ beat and death .
other symptoms include in@@ som@@ nia and concentration problems , severe fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
until now , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although mentally ill asylum seek@@ ers in the welfare offices can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the welfare offices , mostly cler@@ ks or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
with the new production &quot; Passion &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst takes up the traditions of cir@@ cus arts .
the aim is to attract each age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sings and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream on the brick on the brick .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , teacher and junior chef .
&quot; passion &quot; - this is the motto of the current man@@ e production .
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
so the family &apos;s gift is in the blood .
&quot; it is important for us to take people away from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cocktail with a world city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst a concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the program of the cir@@ cus impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .

&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often a topic among various animal welfare organizations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst takes his position : &quot; if our animals are not good , we are not doing well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , are read from their eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to be in the man@@ ege .
this is the first commandment : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together for eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the cir@@ cus , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1,@@ 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all their heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to its performances every day from 17 to 20 September .

Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe talks about wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell from a podium finish at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread over social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also corro@@ bor@@ ated by statements made by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with a ple@@ a .
last month they had rested and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ esis said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones , warning them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told repor@@ ters to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns European Parliament members that immunity will end in parliament and as soon as they leave parliament , its parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said the party managed by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to work from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts at the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing enterprise hardware and service business operations .
the expected job reduction leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP President and Chief Executive Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering up to now un@@ parall@@ eled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; a statement by the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Hew@@ lett in order to manufacture electro @-@ installations and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to manage traditional PC traffic to mobile devices .
the HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the conviction that closely focuss@@ ed companies provide better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb
Wen@@ ger also stressed Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation proceeds according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario suggests that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace in this recent problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it wasn &apos;t in connection with his an@@ kles , or with the injuries that he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also acknowledged , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Inj@@ uries Ltd. has recorded 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere diseases since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for ar@@ senal is that in six out of eight game times since 2007 / 08 , they were one of the two Premier League Clubs which have recorded most injury days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time in which you must strengthen your body and win fighting force , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ senal starts his champi@@ ons League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces himself a rotation inside the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are expected to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to take a little break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Ar@@ senal is clear favour@@ ites to move through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign was launched in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale of 3.2 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Ar@@ senal has drawn up the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and is driven by the far @-@ away hope to lead the association to his first victory in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked out at Ar@@ senal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that gave us serious lessons on male friendship
the absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open themselves is now more desperate than ever before , as demonstrated by suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) announced as the year of the man , with the aim of ques@@ tioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to tackle this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication managed through social media , with emphasis on substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , lifel@@ ong and successful , even if in reality the isolation is domin@@ ating .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic value - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much deeper .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently said , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of friends was that this focuss@@ ing was put up@@ side down .
each character was defined not by his work but by his personality , which gl@@ it@@ tered through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when watching football in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the desire from Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it even if they often re@@ strain themselves to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a telephone counsel@@ ing employee explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when trying to provide long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ si@@ ders status over the phone may help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you come on this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the completely re@@ designed backdrop to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or even better if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know the difference your friendship could make .
friends are sent to Com@@ edy Central from start to finish - all 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ gar Cav@@ ani following his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets on Tuesday at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ gar Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main launched its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his champi@@ ons League Deb@@ ug@@ ts as PS@@ G player who brought the French champion down , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally achieved their advantage when Cav@@ ani scored a head goal in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , since they are not only striving for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic example of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club with which he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents to cause problems and look relaxed even if there are certain things we need to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not achieved one or two other goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris @-@ Team , who could hold a 2 : 2 Draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was exp@@ elled in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was described as the man who took PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month , and he pointed out why when he went into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ i &apos;s pas@@ sports behind Malm@@ ö &apos;s defense before he passed along Johan Wil@@ and into the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , that was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to reach that level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle @-@ field a heavy enemy .
but apart from a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far away from Kevin Tra@@ pps @-@ posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G sometimes gave up , with some short@@ com@@ ings and bad comple@@ tions , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was scra@@ pped in the first half in no less than five attempts and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani used it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved a lot more skill if he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a passport from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who turned Di Maria into a shot , which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second goal finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an also scored his sixth in the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back in the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before the replacement player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi revealed a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core g@@ athers 2.5 billion dollars by share sales
the Swiss mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which is hit by collap@@ sing raw materials prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt settlement plan .
Gl@@ en@@ core , registered in London , stated in an explanation that it sold new shares worth approximately 1.6 billion pounds in order to pay off its own debt .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn pus@@ hes the demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the output of subscription rights brought a rapid rise to the tip of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning .

at the A 71 near Arn@@ stadt the dream came and passed .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old lost control of the sports car , caught fire on a wet track and drove to the guard rail .
the sports car suffered total damage , no one was injured .
the damage is estimated at 40,000 EUR .
X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ahead of the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for the FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times tro@@ phy winner , four times champion league winner , two times club champion , twice European champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and joined the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was standing before the European Championship 2008 before leaving Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told Bar@@ ça to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything at that time , we don &apos;t , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also of FC Bayern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an offer from Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this is working today for the German record champion : pe@@ p Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I played a great EM &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s playing time would run with X@@ av@@ i in 2008 / 2009 .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians across the entire distance on the lawn , out@@ dated the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King &apos;s triumph .
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film@@ making
matt Dam@@ on confronted the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
during a result of the Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown began to emphas@@ ise the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
Brown re@@ acted with insul@@ ted dis@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian res@@ cu@@ ed .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of harmony , &quot; Brown first said .
the only black person , and she is a du@@ ck struck by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that &quot; at the end &quot; she could give something that we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni squee@@ zed his anger over the clip , writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in space , so he can explain her variety - that is SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et served more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 liv@@ ings since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved a nationwide impact and urged law@@ makers and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against farmers .
in February Prince Prince made a reference to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; albums sil@@ ently matter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ ats who will be invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portra@@ yal of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns first champion
professional sports clim@@ ber and assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the grand prize of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant , who could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to finish the stren@@ uous Phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard fought win , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never deser@@ ved or lived more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ aps of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed went down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first ended the course , won &apos;t get any prize money .
according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , it receives the great gra@@ dation .
I don &apos;t think he has got any gru@@ dge about it .
he is so happy to have done what he has done .
he received mass of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family man .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac felt the same if they had exchanged the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ O@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins wasted a chance to climb in a game half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Kis@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three ranks .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go quite concentrated in the game .
the designated tiger Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has curved the fire@@ wood well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the algorithm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( punch ) , looked much better at the bul@@ l@@ pes , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three races in the back at the end of the seventh inner@@ most , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon took his second bass eman Brian Do@@ zier into Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man he was confronted with , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run out of the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the closing @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third bass man Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe faced a Double Play
after breaking down a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inner ring , wall created a R@@ BI @-@ double against the c@@ los of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed player stab@@ bed S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for his fifth S@@ ava .
Detroit prof@@ ited at the start of the game by a still not moving Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three rats in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been removed from the list of injuries prior to the game after he had been missing more than a month because of a spinal cord .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I &apos;ve been wishing for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off B@@ atter in the first place , Hus@@ him gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z led Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; on the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with runners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third player , Nick Castell@@ anos , followed a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or .
he didn &apos;t hit very well , but he got the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , did not score points in the third inning , before being replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J. A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to an injury to the throwing school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder strain , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is cancelled from the list of injuries to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 on four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he was missing on the right hip joint since the 20th of August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees to come to Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily accommod@@ ated there .
they should then be distributed to other communities .
in the past ten days , according to the government pres@@ idency responsible for the initial up@@ take of Gie@@ ßen , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also have emergency shel@@ ters in sport halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the leader of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the resol@@ ute thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he repro@@ ached the European states &quot; collective eyes . &quot;
four years ago it was said that the cup of military participation in Germany has passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees .
Austria controls at southern and eastern borders
in Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister for Home Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said on Tuesday evening in Austrian television station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany too has sent back refugees back to Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement , after which Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives in Germany .
she did not call for concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers will take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
in view of the strong refugee policy in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people more strongly .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , postpon@@ ed Merkel in the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour discussions with the Prime Minister in the German Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who would need protection would receive it too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was expressed unanim@@ ously in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck in the Balkan Route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometers long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania could be blocked by a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbouring country is unlike Serbia as the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence to prevent Hungary from seeking ev@@ asive maneu@@ vers across Romania .
the Romanian government promptly judged the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports in Turkey , thousands of immigrants were forced on their way to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the iron arm@@ or of Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus , a global ocean sw@@ aps .
this is the conclusion of researchers from the observations of the &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; space probe .
so the moon turns easily on its orbit around the ring planets .
this pi@@ geon @-@ movement is only small , but still too big for a continuous cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; leaf@@ let .
it has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already discovered ice @-@ volcanic erup@@ tions at the south pole of Saturn , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles in 2006 and thus feeding the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ Ring of Saturn &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed .
the expansion of the hidden ocean was , however , not clari@@ fied .
R@@ ama missing 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München has to ren@@ ounce Val@@ det R@@ ama for about one month .
an investigation took an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , divided the association .
at the beginning of the week , R@@ ama had been compl@@ aining about pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich @-@ based lion , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presumably four weeks of forced break &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ on loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we need to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sport director Nec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the potential commitment of a uni@@ denti@@ fied pro@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;

contrary to the first fears he remained without a serious cens@@ orship .
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : in them , B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , Man@@ gos contain lots of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus supports sight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasantly smell .
the peel color alone doesn &apos;t matter how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then of course they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives hear@@ ty dishes a special touch .
it allevi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaves such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

first fo@@ eh@@ n tower , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the north side of the F@@ öhn winds through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz rose on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night on Thursday the fo@@ eh@@ n blows with storm strength through the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys .
after finishing on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front which brings heavy rainf@@ all , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature return .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a strong south@@ western current .
on the north side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn winds through the valleys in the night .
the fo@@ eh@@ n blows from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and partly also in the Ur@@ ner@@ land with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn can penetrate right up to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even or@@ bits of over 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday , a stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ n takes care of sum@@ mer@@ y temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow on the slope of the alpine pastures .
this is where the rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the next 48 hours , some 100 liters of rain per square meter must be calculated in the south of the Alps , this after a large amount of rainf@@ all has already fallen in the last few days .
on Thursday morning the blow comes out , as a result a cold front rolls with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east over Switzerland .
along with the cold front , the wind refres@@ hes heavily until stor@@ my , and temperatures rise significantly .
the following days are from 15 to 20 degrees in the north , whereas in the south it is sunny and warmer at a temperature of up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of Bishop Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ former .
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is right in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Association of Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
on Wednesday , Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , rec@@ alled that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often only live in hiding their faith for centuries as a minority .
with the place I become visible in a symbolic way that the tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed in Rome as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
he felt the city back then as a rotten b@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
according to histori@@ ans , his negative impressions should have encouraged him in his later fight against Rome .
Luther then introduced the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses against the aband@@ on@@ ment trade .
hammer artist inv@@ ests three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Alt had painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not in the Ot@@ mar Old Bible , which has now been published with gorgeous pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adjusted to the respective themes , this can be quite dark .
Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible Project for about three years , for which he has taken a subjective and artistic selection from the many thematic areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
this resulted in cycles that dev@@ ote themselves to themes such as cross paths , pl@@ agues , commandments or pat@@ ernity .
he has spontaneously become fascinated by several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its emphasis on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and are translated into today &apos;s current context . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
embedded between the original quote of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , he formulated his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old permits a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protestant Sovereign Order of Malta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing was done with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up to bring me back with the Lord again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to increase the importance of art in a fast @-@ moving time : &quot; today , the perception of pic@@ torial worlds is shaped by advertisement , and that is noisy .
symboli@@ sm is being displaced .
artists have a different lust and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like the viewers to &quot; fall in &quot; into the images , let them work on themselves , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost conf@@ essed on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like him to understand life with his pictures . &quot;
I did not pay attention to the fact that the Bible was fully compreh@@ ended , but also selected for him important , mysterious themes .
&quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here is the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; a picture Bible was created .
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of the Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X train is approaching
plans made , space found , company commissioned , earth moun@@ ds model@@ ed for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was finished .
om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration were responsible for this , especially with the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill seclu@@ ded , new place searched - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval was agreed in October , the first coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck could now communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another memorial break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , while the Bundes@@ li@@ ga is putting a clear signal on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football re@@ acts to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in tac@@ kl@@ ing the upcoming problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this to be the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can be no one to say in principle , that &apos;s nothing about me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B leader Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will intensively discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet with Minister Mrs. Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football can and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the fr@@ inge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some Bundes@@ li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
already this weekend , the 36 professionals will sign a clear sign if they will be wearing &quot; We - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot , instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports manager Ru@@ di Vö@@ ller said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama tells everyone , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football teams , no , we need to use our beam , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig compl@@ ained of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Championships against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that all 36 licence agreements have started their own projects in their places is great .
it &apos;s just as great that small and small clubs are there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year and next year , the Association , together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government , will provide 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : chief executive officer loses an eye in case of accident
according to several reports , Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye with a down@@ fall at the beginning of July .
at the accident on the stair@@ way in his brother &apos;s house in the U.S. , he dropped to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s almost ble@@ ed , was impot@@ ent , then dra@@ gged out on the street - that he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully functional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company .
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s important to stand up once you &apos;ve fallen down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us vs K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ low potential in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group play of the Europa League have finally broken .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ li@@ ga in a du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 h / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ li@@ ga Top game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its trunk position on the Re@@ us position .
he thus announced a change to the position of door@@ keeper .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes up the place of tribal host@@ ess Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion .
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be deployed in all Europa League matches in the future , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open .
with high probability he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ mid@@ able statement by fellow player Re@@ us , that the final move for the BV@@ B in the Europa League should be the goal , means that mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl follows : &quot; therefore Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to lead the way for Germany
according to the German government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in changing the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , intends to invest in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke in Frankfurt on Wednesday at the IAA from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and provide less traffic , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he also wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states that come together with industry representatives at the IAA .
among other things , the strategy paper of the ministry of transport emphasizes the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid transition to digital radio .
there is currently a test track on the free@@ way 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not impose additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wishes to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally that the maximum speed limit for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also intends to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged man as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data within seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be expected far from 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study estimate the value added in driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany for 20@@ 25 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of passenger cars can lead to increased safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still look skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey carried out on Wednesday at the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonom@@ ously driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent expect only 20 years , 31 percent believe in it at all .
in France , 21 per cent of respon@@ dents count up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
according to a survey of Digital Union Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to surrender the control during the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , this could mean at least 15 percent in flowing traffic , 45 percent in traffic .
well , every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
according to current status at the title fight , Düsseldorf wants to open only in sing@@ les from 25th September to 4th October .
the final decision should be made latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll was at that time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship date in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who lists the S@@ etz@@ als in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the European Championships 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo also lack@@ ed and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the World Ran@@ king Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an enf@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figur@@ ine cabinet : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : window mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer who , among other things , became the star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he was wearing men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I &apos;m the enf@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it used to be ble@@ ak in the past , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the walk@@ way ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer changed his initially negative attitude to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually , he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get into the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in the Canadian city of Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed complete artwork for which much effort was carried out : to freeze the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired for example .
according to the dict@@ ator , Thierry Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , 14 tons of material have ar@@ ra@@ ged to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather trousers @-@ outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ inous fashionable Geh@@ versuche of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later contributed to the dis@@ miss@@ al of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , but of course .
for his first fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewelry instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ dry tip as fashion niche
in the past , the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en were about to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were created in large quantities for customers who , for example , worked on blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ vers@@ mith P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early days of the P@@ lau@@ ener lace fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ til industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt called some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past bul@@ lies , creates an increasing job potential . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who don &apos;t use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already make up half of all orders .
Mo@@ eb@@ itze P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
private specialist shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach customers in this way .
the mass @-@ produced goods are produced much cheaper in Asia nowadays and are sold almost exclusively through chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the USA .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also seeks to score points through environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains by the embroi@@ dery bead in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have introduced a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also relates to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - special@@ ising in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there arises a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ vit@@ alized the historic snow@@ ball point .
the machine ch@@ okes little chi@@ cks at some places .
the P@@ lau@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing master Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; before I could do nothing with traditional pl@@ um tip . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball point for her jewelry .
in a complex process she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want to have a mem@@ ento .
with this I see my jewellery as modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ dry lace .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
legends are not to be touched , but Disney also vent@@ ures into a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is not about a re@@ movie , but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical child ma@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s about the experiences of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins over 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already standing : ro@@ b Marshall , last but not least with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider to the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy has to open wider out@@ wards to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was tas@@ ked with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for the deep@@ ening of comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
promoting new start @-@ ups and promoting reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list for regulating market access , relaxation of border controls politics , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the inhabitants milking system .
after the statement , a negative list is drawn up which identifies sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is important as it plays a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , ensuring a right @-@ state business environment and makes the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on powers transferred to companies and make sure companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
in the context of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;

EU wants to double mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and to give consumers a significantly higher dose of the tox@@ in .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , having a corresponding EU job paper , sharply critici@@ zed the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full power to pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish for &quot; economic policy reasons , &quot; should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury that , on the basis of the still valid limits , about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ sal@@ able .
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish currently 0.5 mg to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are mostly so low loaded that they already comply with the planned maximum values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ on@@ ef@@ ish is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de steering maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal man , which is strongly enriched over the food chain in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system in particular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the valid maximum values , however , that a &quot; health endanger@@ ment of the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
mercury is mainly due to coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written statement by the Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants meet more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish , for example in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted the &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March from the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , European warning signs on mercury in fish have become one of the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
