&quot; II ) If the Community pres@@ upp@@ oses either a nom@@ ination or at any time against a denom@@ ination , the organization of the Community and the States suggests one or more alternate ren@@ ditions . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the re@@ peti@@ tive ref@@ usal of the Community to appro@@ ve the appointment of inspec@@ tors of the organisation , the Council shall discuss the ref@@ usal after him the General Director of the Organisation - referred to as &quot; the General Director , &quot; with the aim of meeting appropriate measures . &quot;
B ) The community and the States concerned will take the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization can actually perform tasks according to their agreement .
( C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are arranged in such a way that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying peaceful nuclear activities are as low as possible ;
II ) The protection of industrial secrets and other the inspec@@ tors of the organization for knowledge of confidential information is ensured .
&quot; each state applies to the organization , including its assets , means and assets , as well as against its inspec@@ tors and other officials , the tasks following the Convention , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the prer@@ og@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures in accordance with this Convention are concluded with regard to core material , if the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a manner that it is not usable for a nuclear activity that is under the point of view of the securing measures of Bel@@ ang , or has become virtually non @-@ profitable . &quot;
the Community noti@@ fies the organization according to the stipul@@ ations of this Convention on the transfer of nuclear material from the states that are subject to the securing measures in accordance with this Convention .
&quot; the securing measures in accordance with this Convention are concluded with regard to core material , as soon as the recipient state , as fores@@ een in this Convention , has taken over responsibility for it . &quot;
the organization performs documents from which any transfer and possibly the re@@ use of the backup measures will result in the given core material .
&quot; if nuclear material is to be used in accordance with this Convention , in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , the association with the organization agreed with the organization of such use of the material , under which circumstances the securing measures can be terminated in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material during the duration of the non @-@ application of the securing measures is not used for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive bodies .
B ) The organization and community make arrangements that the securing measures provided in this Convention shall not be applied for as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
&quot; in the regulation , as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these security measures are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the backup measures provided in this Convention will be re @-@ applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization is held on the ongoing basis on the total quantity and composition of this material in the country concerned or in the states concerned , and on any transfer of such material from this state or these states . &quot;
&quot; this explains its agreement as quickly as possible ; it extends only to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural rules and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement of the knowledge of the military activity and does not refer to the use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the States bear the costs that each of them grow in carrying out their respective obligations under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the community , the states or persons who are subject to their territorial authority , but extraordinary expenses as a result of a special exploration of the organization , will reimbur@@ se the organisation of these costs as long as it has been prepared beforehand . &quot;
&quot; in any event , the organisation will carry out the costs of all additional measurements and sampling , which are required by inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States ensure that liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be avail@@ ed upon the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same way as to the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim that the Community or State vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis the organization or organization against the organization or the organization against the community or the organization against damages , except for damages arising from a nuclear incident , is regulated in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the relevant information provided by the General Director , the Council determines that the organization must not be able to refund the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Statutes and , if necessary , take the other measures provided there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which mass has been achieved by the assurance measures applied , offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties is concerned , any justi@@ fiable opportunity to grant the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , community or state , consultations on questions that arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
the Community and the States are entitled to seek that any questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the state to participate in discussing such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of any dispute relating to an establishment of the Council pursuant to Article 19 or any of the measures taken by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention are to be submitted to a court of arbit@@ ration on the request of a party which consists of five arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the community and states design@@ ate two arbit@@ rators , the organization also names two arbit@@ rators , and the four so named ump@@ ires elect a fifth to pres@@ ide . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the organization are not named by two arbit@@ rators , the community or organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint this arbitr@@ ator . &quot;
the same procedure is applicable if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator of the fifth arbit@@ rators is not yet elected .
&quot; a majority of the members of the arbit@@ ration court shall be competent , and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the arbit@@ ration court are binding for the organisation , the community and the states concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This Convention enters into force for non @-@ nuclear powers , the contracting party of the contract and members of the Community ( in force , i ) when the relevant state of the organization notices that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention and &quot;
( II ) If the organization of the organization notices that it is able to apply its safegu@@ ards to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the States consult each other upon request of one of the Parties to a change in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) Any changes require the consent of the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
C ) The General Director immediately teaches all Member States of the Organization immediately of any change in this Convention .
( a ) This Convention enters into force on the day in which the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification that their procedures are concluded for the entry into force .
B ) These conventions remain in force as long as the states are the contracting party of the contract .
the expression &quot; agreement &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol .
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedure required for the implementation of the provisions of Part I on securing measures .
the aim of the procedures laid down in this Convention is the timely discovery of the turno@@ ff of significant amounts of core material of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear prolifer@@ ation for unknown purposes as well as det@@ err@@ ence from such a cross@@ road through the risk of premature discovery .
&quot; for the gran@@ ting of the target defined in Article 28 , the accounting is essential as a securing measure of basic meaning , which is used with the spatial integration and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
the technical completion of the test ex@@ ams by the organization takes place by means of an explanation in which for each material balance zone the material quantity which is not proven for a certain period under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified seas .
&quot; when carrying out their tests , the organization after Article 3 makes full use of the community &apos;s backup system . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for core material according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; when applying their backup measures , the community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following nature and they , as far as necessary , see how they are determined in the supplementary agreements and are practical : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved , her@@ edi@@ tary , lost , lost , or otherwise from the stock of core material and stock levels ; &quot;
B ) the assessment of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and assessment of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) Procedure for determining , checking and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot;
e ) Procedure for ass@@ essing accumulation of non @-@ measured continu@@ ances and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol - and report system , which displays the core material existence for each material balance zone and the changes in this inventory , including the input and output of the material balance zone ; &quot;
( g ) precau@@ tions which ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Procedure for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organisation in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures in accordance with this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore treatment .
&quot; B ) Bec@@ omes a pri@@ on or th@@ ori@@ um@@ per@@ y material that has not yet been reached under the letter c ) , the Community of the organisation shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material that is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope submission , or if this core material or other , in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circulation system manufactured in the States , is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The safety measures provided in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions specified under Article 11 . however , the community considers that the recovery of core material , which is subject to the provisions of this Convention , is temporarily not possible or desirable , so consult the organisation and the community on the use of appropriate safegu@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; B ) The safety measures provided in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions specified under Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community are agre@@ eable that this core material is practically non @-@ profitable . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the Community , the organisation liber@@ ates the following core material from the backup measures in accordance with this Convention : &quot;
a ) special cle@@ av@@ age material when used in grams - or smaller quantities as sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Nu@@ clear material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities after Article 13 , if such core material is retro@@ active , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope conc@@ entri@@ c of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 that is above 80 % .
&quot; on request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es core material that would otherwise be subject to securing measures pursuant to this Convention as long as the whole , because of this Article in the states , is no longer at any time more than &quot;
a ) a kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment , which is below 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , is calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
&quot; C ) twenty metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium , with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ; &quot;
&quot; liber@@ ated core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the safety measures in accordance with the Convention , are processed or stored , so precau@@ tions for the re@@ use of the backup measures are made on that material . &quot;
&quot; the Community is meeting the organisation of supplementary agreements , which are necessary in the scope that is necessary to ensure the successful and effective execution of the tasks of the organization following the Convention in the individual , as defined in the procedure laid down in the Convention . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be extended or amended without any change in the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the acceptance between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; based on the initial report published in Article 62 , the organisation publishes a summar@@ ized inventory of the entire core material in the States , not@@ with@@ standing its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory according to the following reports and the results of their investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its member states Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; ( a ) The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme defined at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation , in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is hin@@ dered by general res@@ sour@@ ced problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) The objective of the EEC and the Member States , that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
d ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle bind@@ ings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the EW@@ G organisation has submitted a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set forth in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; &quot; Special Edi@@ ting Account &quot; &quot; which the Member States will contribute to the special transaction account ; this account is referred to by the organization as a st@@ ew@@ ard and used ( in this property the organization is referred to as &quot; &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is administr@@ ated separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment takes place in the form of cash or in@@ significant deb@@ its of the member state , who pay upon request in the currency of the respective state at Order of the Organization as a custo@@ dian of the special transaction account and to be depos@@ ited at the establishment of the organisation in the country concerned . &quot;
B ) The payment takes place in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contract within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the Administr@@ ative appointed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the settlement of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the EEC and the Administr@@ ative Committee considering the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may make payments to the above mentioned dates upon request .
&quot; in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes about propor@@ tion@@ ate drawing on the cash or the school notes in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction and to compens@@ ate the special transaction account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in gran@@ ting this loan , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors under the terms of the EEC : &quot;
III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ e@@ eable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) of the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its further credit absorption capacity on loan terms without compensation ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each transaction credit serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly expanding development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it is considered to be a loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices , which are considered , approved and managed for the financing of funds financed by the Organization , with the aim of the cor@@ ro@@ gation to be considered under the letter b ) of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special transaction account must not be used instead of proper funds from the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the implementation of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; aside from section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same terms of withdrawal which are generally applicable to the organization granted by the organization ; they are thus ref@@ und@@ able at ten free years each in 50 years . &quot;
special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
the amounts paid to the payment of these don@@ ors are to be paid directly to the organization that re@@ tains them .
&quot; each special transaction is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in particular the origin of the means . &quot;
&quot; the proceeds from any special transaction can be used for spending in the currency of the benef@@ ici@@ ary or for goods or services that are established respectively . ( ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization are and who according to what the car@@ et@@ aker has specified at the time of the loan granted , shall be recipient of a special transaction . &quot;
&quot; capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of a special transaction are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in the currency of a member state shall be transferred back as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State concerned . &quot;
the car@@ et@@ aker informs the EEC on the plans and programmes approved by the directors until full disclosure of all the special transaction loans .
&quot; during the time of payment of the special transaction , the Administr@@ ator will inform the EE@@ G quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made for this . &quot;
the administrator transfers the EEC as soon as possible after completion of the business year of the organization a detailed accounting of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization to this account .
&quot; after full payment of the special transaction , the management of the EEC will be sent as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the special transaction . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker prepar@@ es and performs appropriate records and invo@@ ices , from which the contributions to the special transaction account resulting from the account recei@@ v@@ ables , the amounts paid to the account and the deposits paid to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together in order to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the st@@ ew@@ ard to the complete issue of the means of the special transaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas on the status of the special transaction account , the progress of the programmes or projects financed by special action , and on all other issues relating to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the EEC and the organisation would not enter into force , so the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties with immediate effect are due . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement , the total amount of the debt owed by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 shall be returned to the Member States , so this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the Member States governments noti@@ fies the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to the conclusion of the proceedings in question .
the General Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications together with an Not@@ i@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
&quot; this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , following the day of receipt of the above notification in the organisation . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is written in two manus@@ crip@@ ts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch . &quot;
&quot; in consideration that the agreement is to be concluded in the form of a letter to am@@ end the Annex A of Protocol No. 1 , to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) - H@@ AT F@@ OL@@ GEN@@ CE RE@@ LA@@ SS@@ ES : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Bundes@@ rat , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a Joint Company after Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been dealing with research in the area of controlled fusion and plasma physics , and is very familiar with the area concerned . &quot;
&quot; as far as the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion is still to be carried out , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to summar@@ ise its relevant efforts to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and to accelerate their respective research , which have gained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is intended to enable any contracting party to take the greatest benefit by amal@@ gam@@ ation of its research efforts on the field of controlled fusion and plasma physics , resulting in the common objective of this research , i.e. the cost @-@ effective hydro@@ electricity generation by using the controlled core fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Annex I and II of this Agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Schweizer Programm . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom programme ; it will be extended or amended by the organs referred to in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; any time the contracting parties accept a new programme , the programs listed in Annex I and II shall apply . &quot;
the association proposed in paragraph 1 is realised by : - adequate participation of each of the contracting parties during preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom countries , in Switzerland and in the third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as the laboratories working on the Eur@@ atom programme ; &quot;
- mutual right to access the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
&quot; as part of the objective of the present agreement , Switzerland is involved in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in view of the association agreement fores@@ een in Article 2 paragraph 1 of this Agreement , the Parties conclude an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; association agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those who are concluded between the Commission and the states and companies or persons , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated bodies &quot; in view of the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is responsible for the fact that Switzerland is implic@@ ated in the time of the entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the Associ@@ ated Organ@@ iz@@ ations , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Deal of Human Resources . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland belongs to J@@ ET Common company at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement , its stat@@ ute . &quot;
Eur@@ atom is also responsible for ensuring that Switzerland can become a contractual partner of any contract with the exception of association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement .
the organs involved in carrying out the association specified in Article 2 section 1 of the present agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in association agreement .
&quot; the association agreement , in particular , includes the establishment of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Council of the Federal Council . &quot;
&quot; - to monitor the development of research work , to ensure the best possible results are achieved in line with the objectives of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; VG &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the VG , which has to guarantee the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions relating to ongoing or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom programme , assumes that this agreement relates to all research and development activities . &quot;
&quot; it promotes the cooperation and co @-@ ordination between the affiliated organs and establishes their T * ity in the interests of the two parties to the common goal defined in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme , as well as the common goal defined in Article 1 of the present agreement , whereby the scientific and technological developments are to be considered in the world . &quot;
&quot; according to its Rules of Procedure , the VG will appoint one or more Swiss representatives in the consulting groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme whenever the relevant Swiss authorities are concerned . &quot;
&quot; the advis@@ ers , which the VG research proposals submitted for the Eur@@ atom programme provide the best possible scientific results , assume this task with regard to all research and development work , which is referred to in this agreement . &quot;
Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the laboratories involved within the Eur@@ atom programme .
&quot; the committee &apos;s committee , which has to super@@ vise the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and is responsible for ensuring that the capacities of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the program , fulfil@@ s this task with respect to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;

&quot; in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic , via trade with Hamm@@ el and lamb &quot;
&quot; I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set out provisions on the import of Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties have agreed as follows : &quot;
&quot; - Fresh or cooled hammer - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for Hamm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat from Argentina will be fixed to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in batt@@ le@@ weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure that the amount of the annual quantity did not exceed the agreed quantity and executed according to the conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form be made possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other before introducing such a change in the Committee referred to under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community uses the protection clause , it is oblig@@ ated to ensure that the access of Argentina in this agreement is not affected by the community market . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of products collected by this agreement to a throughput of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; when entering new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount set according to the scope of Argent@@ inian trading with each new Member State . &quot;
the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be invo@@ iced to the Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ ment of the Ex@@ haus@@ tion under number 5 .
&quot; the total quantity mentioned under number 2 is determined on the day of the Greek accession to the community , to 23 000 tons of slaughter . &quot;
the community is taking everything to avoid market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an hammer and lamb meat on the joint market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the Community is taking precau@@ tions to prevent the sale of frozen meats in frozen meat due to the implementation of the Ord@@ in@@ ance of Argent@@ inian hammer and lamb meat . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of reimbur@@ sements or other funding measures for the export of hammer and lamb , as well as to the slaughter of certain living sheep and lamb , are only at prices and conditions that are consistent with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these articles . &quot;
&quot; these terms are in a way compatible with the XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular , that within the quantities specified in this agreement , the quantities specified in this agreement are granted under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the community oblig@@ ates itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina is made dependent upon the submission of an export license , which is granted by the responsible body designated by the Argent@@ inian government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system shall be specified in such a way that a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import licence shall be wai@@ ved .
&quot; in this respect , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals is granted the quantities that have been issued for export licensing ; this information may be en@@ forced according to destination country . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; he regularly examines the tendency on the hammer , lamb , and the meat market of both parties and the world market as well as the sales conditions in these markets , including the conditions mentioned under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement is not affected by the fact that articles from Hamm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat are carried out under the agreement not mentioned collective numbers following the Community . &quot;
the Committee shall discuss all questions arising during the implementation of this agreement and recommends the competent authorities appropriate solutions .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount stated under number 2 applies for the period from 1 January to 31 December .
the amount required by the entry into force of this agreement is determined in relation to the total annual amount and takes account of the seasonal character of trade .

&quot; I honor the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to set out provisions on the import of Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a joint market organisation for Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep @-@ economy and the export of mut@@ ton and lamb after the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy is exist@@ ential and that the normal paragraph of New Zealand &apos;s hammer and lamb is not affected in these markets , I honour the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement is valid for : - fresh or cooled hammer - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; after this agreement , New Zealand is safegu@@ ar@@ ded for Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat of access to the market of the Community in the fixed amount . &quot;
new Zealand preser@@ ves the assurance that the normal paragraph of his hammer and lamb is not affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is obliged to ensure that the set quantity did not exceed the set quantity . &quot;
the prescribed quantities are carried out in traditional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand will not be prevented from using new technological developments or maintain its competitive position on the market of the Community .
&quot; should a change in the offer form be made possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties consult each other before introducing such a change in the committees mentioned in clause 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community uses the protection clause , it is oblig@@ ated to protect the interests of New Zealand from this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from that country . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of the products collected by this agreement to a height of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with New Zealand changes the quantities laid down in Clau@@ se 2 according to the extent of New Zealand trade with each new Member State . &quot;
the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined according to the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be taken into account in Clau@@ se 5 stated Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ ment of the Ex@@ haus@@ tion .
&quot; the total volume mentioned in Clau@@ se 2 is determined on the day of the Greek accession to the community , to 245 500 tons of slaughter . &quot;
the community takes everything in order to avoid a market development that could imp@@ air the ordinary paragraph of New Zealand &apos;s hammer and lamb meat on the joint market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the Community is taking precau@@ tions in order to prevent the sale of interference from frozen meat due to the execution of the ordin@@ ance of this objective . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two parties are undertaking everything in order to promote the consumption of creative in the community without risk for market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of reimbur@@ sements or other funding measures for the export of hammer and lamb , as well as to the slaughter of certain living sheep and lamb , are only at prices and conditions that are consistent with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community in world trade with these articles . &quot;
&quot; new Zealand guarantees compliance with the quantities mentioned in clause 2 , in particular , that there are no export lic@@ ences beyond these quantities . &quot;
&quot; the Community is committed to meeting all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in New Zealand is dependent upon the submission of an export license , which is granted by the competent authority appointed by the New Zealand Government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system shall be specified in such a way that a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import licence shall be wai@@ ved .
&quot; in addition , the responsible body @-@ domain authority of the responsible body of the Community in regular intervals has been granted the quantities that have been issued for export licensing ; this information may be en@@ forced according to destination country . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; the committee regularly examines the tendency on the hammer , lamb and goat meat market of the two parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions in these markets , including the conditions mentioned for the purpose mentioned in clause 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of the agreement is not affected by the fact that the products made of Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement not mentioned tari@@ ff numbers following the Community . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall discuss all the issues arising in the implementation of the Agreement , which will be submitted to it by a contracting party , and recommends the appropriate authorities appropriate solutions . &quot;
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the contracting parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount stated in Clau@@ se 2 applies for the period from 1 January to 31 December .
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand , as well as for the main territory of New Zealand on the other hand . &quot;

recognition of the fact that the implementation of the MEP so far has been made possible thanks to the financial means provided by the UN environmental program as well as the voluntary contributions of governments .
&quot; knowing the fact that the contribution of the UN environmental program is only done by the end of 1984 and this contribution , as well as the voluntary contributions of governments not fully cover the costs of application of the E@@ MEP &apos;s work plan , so that it is why precau@@ tions must be taken to ensure long @-@ term financing after 1984 , &quot;
&quot; in view of the requirement imposed by the Economic Commission for Europe in its decision B ( XX@@ X@@ VIII ) to the governments of the Member States of the EEC ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; executive body , &quot; ) , in accordance with the procedures specified in the first meeting of the Executive Committee of the Convention ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Executive Co@@ unc@@ ement , &quot; in particular those related to the work of the E@@ MEP , &quot;

containers and inf@@ usion Devices are shipped with an English and French label to label the samples contained in the systems 2 to 10 of this protocol .
human thorou@@ gh@@ bred can only be disp@@ at@@ ched in containers in which the temperature can be kept to 4 C to 6 C during the whole transport .
&quot; the preparations and devices mentioned in part II of this protocol must be ster@@ ile , ap@@ y rogen and non @-@ toxic . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to add the equipment required to inf@@ usion , as well as solvents for dry preparations . &quot;
human thorou@@ gh@@ bred is the blood taken from a healthy man and is mixed with a suitable anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant .
&quot; C ) which are not free from blood trans@@ f@@ usions , as far as this can be ensured through simple medical examination and medical history . &quot;
&quot; blood removal is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is gli@@ de through a closed , ster@@ ile tube system into a ster@@ ile bottle , in which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution was introduced before sterili@@ sation . &quot;
&quot; after the removal of the blood@@ stream , the bottle is immediately closed and cooled to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . thereafter it must be opened immediately before using the blood . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution may not exceed 220 ml per litre of human blood , and the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration must not exceed 97 g per litre . &quot;
the blood group following the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is previously determined to determine the blood cells and the ser@@ um ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is performed by examining the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or blood .
&quot; as far as there are standardized or recommended procedures for blood group determination in individual countries , these are applicable . &quot;
&quot; the name R@@ h @-@ negative is only to use if specific investigations yiel@@ ded the absence of the anti@@ gens C , D , you and E . &quot;
the blood exchanged according to this Convention shall only be used for recipients of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 group .
&quot; the human thorou@@ gh@@ bred is stored in ster@@ ile , sealed bottle from micro@@ organisms and allowed to keep up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are permissible only during the time required for testing and transport , which allowed the blood to cool down to 4 to 6 C. &quot;
a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unit of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred from which the majority of the plasma has been removed .
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been won ; other blood cells may be present or may have been partially removed .
the liquid content of the concentrate consists of either the remaining plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic irri@@ gation solution which was added after the removal of the plasma .
&quot; the volume of red blood cells is to be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , the approximate percentage of the er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit ) is indicated on the label . &quot;
&quot; all procedures necessary for the production must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions , which must be carried out using a ster@@ ile , closed system and only through pressure . &quot;
&quot; an artificial wat@@ ery solution has been added , so on the label also its volume and composition is attached . &quot;
&quot; the human dry plasma is obtained through drying of the liquid , which decreases in cent@@ ering or sedi@@ mentation of human blood . &quot;
the human dry plasma is obtained through cold @-@ drying or any other method by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of proteins is avoided .
&quot; the dry product can easily be dissolved in a quantity of water , which corresponds to the amount of liquid that one went out in the production of the substance . &quot;
the protein concentration of the solution obtained may not be less than 45 g per litre and the solution must not be visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products .
donations where ( using a fresh sample ) a hazardous content of is@@ oh@@ em@@ ol@@ ys@@ ine or immune hem@@ or@@ ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ine has been established are excluded .
&quot; if the plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours of blood sampling , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a blood volume of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to eliminate the harmful effects of bacterial growth in plasma , blood donations are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be demonstrated in a blood amount of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the risk of transmitt@@ ing I@@ no@@ kul@@ ation@@ sh@@ rou@@ ts , there are mixtures that do not contain more than 12 donations , or apply other methods to reduce this risk in a comparable manner . &quot;
&quot; one of the liquid quantity , from which one went out during the production of the plasma , is to be added ; the substance must be completely detached from 15 to 20 C within 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; a given Qu@@ antum Plasma will be dissolved in the amount of water , which corresponds to the amount of fluid from which it was produced ; the solution is subjected to the following tests : &quot;
&quot; II ) employing a sufficient amount of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine or calcium chlori@@ de , the process can be accelerated in the incub@@ ation furnace at 37 C. &quot;
&quot; due to the 24@@ grade drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ d under a pressure of at most 0,@@ 02 mm mer@@ cury , weight loss can not occur at the human dry plasma weight loss . &quot;
&quot; human dry plasma is stored in a nitrogen @-@ atmosphere or in the air @-@ empty space in a ster@@ ile , sealed bottle under exclusion of any micro @-@ organisms and after the possibility of any moisture ; it is protected from light and maintain at a temperature below 20 C. &quot;
human alb@@ um@@ in and fra@@ ctions from human plasma proteins are preparations from the protein component that consist of approximately 60 % of the total protein of the plasma of the human blood .
&quot; regardless of whether the final product should be flu@@ ffy or dry , the product must have been heated to 60 C Â± 0.5 C in the final container in the final container for 10 hours to in@@ activate the path@@ ogen of the in@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; in preparation of human alb@@ um@@ in , at least 95 % of the mass of existing proteins must be alb@@ um@@ in . &quot;
in both preparations there may be no more than 10 mg of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin G per gram of the product .
&quot; if the final product is fre@@ eze , it must contain at least 950 mg of protein per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; if the group is made of human plasma proteins as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration of between 45 and 50 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; human alb@@ um@@ in is produced as a solution , so it must have a total protein concentration of at least 45 g per litre . &quot;
&quot; measurements of viscosity and clou@@ d@@ iness , as well as centri@@ fu@@ ging with the ultra@@ centri@@ fu@@ ge and electro@@ phor@@ esis , which are carried out before and after heating on the solutions , must not result in den@@ atur@@ ation of dissolved proteins . &quot;
&quot; after heating up to 57 C and six @-@ stage bulk solids in a mechanical she@@ ar tester at this temperature , the solution must be completely free of visible particles . &quot;
( I ) The due tests with specific antibodies must show that only human plasma proteins are contained in both preparations ;

the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in fluid form according to label lies at most one year after the last satisfactory effectiveness test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date on the label for dry re@@ agents is based on the results of shelf trials ; it is appro@@ achable by the state regul@@ ators .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of iner@@ ated gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which it has been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penet@@ rate . &quot;
&quot; a dry re@@ agent may lose only 0.5 BC of its weight , if it is tested by further drying about phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxy@@ d at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent governmental authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) may be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic if the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to provide the prerequis@@ ites for specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml flu@@ essi@@ gen or re@@ dissolved ser@@ ums .
&quot; re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after recovery , must be transparent and must neither contain sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles . &quot;

&quot; in THE RE@@ LA@@ TION , that this Convention may not be constru@@ ed in a way that it bin@@ ds the contractual parties from its obligations arising from other international agreements - &quot;
&quot; in this Convention , measures are set to simplify the transactions in the goods traffic between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries , as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; for this purpose , a unified administration document ( herein@@ after referred to as a unified paper ) is to be used for all export and import proceedings as well as for a common handling procedure ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; shipping method &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
the mer@@ ges associated with the goods traffic between the contracting parties are authorised by means of a single paper to use the prints according to the patterns in Annex I to this Convention .
&quot; depending on the case , the single paper is used as application or paper for export , shipping , or import@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; - for the implementation of legislation applicable in a contracting party , whose application would not be guaranteed with any use of the safety paper ; &quot;
&quot; - to be asked by the parties , so that they may apply to the enjoyment of a part or a certain relief . &quot;

&quot; ( 2 ) Sub@@ ject to paragraph 1 , registration must always be carried out in one of the official languages of the import country if it is carried out in this country using the copy of the registered copy of the registered office or the destination country . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or its representative may apply for each individual process section of a commodity exchange between the contracting parties which , if necessary , can be included in the examples required for the execution of the festivities in one of the following sections . &quot;
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 must not be linked to a special condition of the competent authorities .
&quot; without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions on collection shipments , the competent authorities may however anticip@@ ate that the f@@ ences for export and shipping procedures can be made to one and the same pre @-@ pressure by means of the copies provided for these celebrations . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities are convinced , as far as possible , that the information contained in the copies of the registration form included in the individual procedures . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) In order to ensure a smooth flow of goods between the contracting parties and to facilitate the disclosure of dis@@ continu@@ ities or infrin@@ gements , the customs authorities of these countries face each other upon request or - if they consider it of interest for another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) &quot;

&quot; ( 4 ) If the representative of a contracting party in the con@@ ciliation committee assumed a decision under the reservation of the constitutional requirements , the decision , if there is no date , shall enter into force on the first day of the second month after notification of the cancellation of the reservation . &quot;
&quot; each contracting party adop@@ ts suitable measures to ensure an effective and balanced implementation of this Convention , with the necessity of taking into account the partic@@ ul@@ arities that withstand the goods traffic as far as possible and to supply satisfactory solutions to all mutually satisfactory solutions when applying the provisions of this Convention . &quot;
