&quot; the present document is a summary of the European Public Administration Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which is explained how the drug candidate ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out in order to get recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the prescription label ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; multi@@ polar thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usions ; • Bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance , a mental disorder where patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of an@@ or@@ mal high mood ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood . &quot;
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes associated with the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces when oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be applied to intake or the enam@@ el tablets in patients receiving the swal@@ lowing of tablets . &quot;
&quot; for patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells among each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is probably mainly used as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for recept@@ ors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole acts as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in less dimensions than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ r@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy , to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms , was examined in three studies by up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which suffered an increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence , to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy Inj@@ ection Solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased un@@ rest with which Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and plac@@ ebo were compared over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was examined by a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment . &quot;
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body res@@ or@@ bed the enam@@ el tablets and the solution to intake ( decreases ) .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution showed patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased un@@ rest than the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo .
&quot; moreover , A@@ bili@@ fy imp@@ eded up to 74 weeks more effectively than plac@@ ebo the re @-@ occurrence of man@@ ic episodes in previously untreated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyram@@ idal distur@@ ban@@ ces ( un@@ controlled ) , hi@@ ber@@ ty ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , dis@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in treating schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , as well as in preventing a new man@@ ic episode in patients who have predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes addressed the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in quick control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , if oral therapy is not appropriate , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . approval for the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union . &quot;
abili@@ fy is for treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of Bi@@ polar @-@ I@@ - disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes related to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day daily regardless of meals .
&quot; increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dosage should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duction is removed from combination therapy , the recommended dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
the occurrence of su@@ ic@@ idal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorder and was reported in some cases following the beginning or after change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy and also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , failure disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions prescribed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ asis , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted a year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; if the patient treated with A@@ bili@@ fy symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , should be taken into consideration , reduce the dose or break down the treatment . &quot;
&quot; when a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a minor , or uncle@@ ar high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be dismis@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ nes@@ is or at states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of dying in comparison with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma , or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
there are no accurate risk in@@ estim@@ ations for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia related adverse events with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic agents that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , Poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as side effects , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary action of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with super@@ imposed side effects such as sed@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with healthy subjects , a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and that is why similar can reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabolism . &quot;
&quot; considering the common administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , the potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before starting the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the lack of data for safety in humans and due to the concerns developed in reproductive studies , this medicine may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study more than 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total decreased incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption - In a controlled trial of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 53,@@ 3 % in patients with op@@ i@@ dol treatment .
in another study more than 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % was treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3,5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and con@@ vul@@ sions , undes@@ irable cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the efficacy of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma termination . &quot;
it is believed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is medi@@ ated in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ GF recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed high aff@@ inity for D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ recep@@ tor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tor as well as an even aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and for hi@@ stam@@ ine H@@ 1@@ reception . &quot;
&quot; at the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks on healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 @-@ recep@@ tor lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and am put@@ amen . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time trials ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant increase in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a half @-@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 percent of respon@@ dents considered a response to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales , which were defined as secondary study destinations , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ ber@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sion rates scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher return rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 314 patients and in which the primary study potential &apos; weight gain &apos; was , with significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible doses above 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a conservation effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable amount of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , like lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partly over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mir@@ r@@ oring , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase , over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation phase before random@@ ization , was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar retreat , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the Enzy@@ me CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ oping of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , which is cataly@@ sed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
&quot; the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ ary period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metalli@@ zation via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , and at approximately 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ aboli@@ ans via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a simulation @-@ specific analysis on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not indicate clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study of subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on security sp@@ ar ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the car@@ cin@@ ogenic potential , pre@@ clinical data could not detect any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions , which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects include a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ ergi@@ c toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to the average ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ x of the average ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was as@@ cer@@ tained as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ g@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1- to 3@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations observed in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was not more than 6 % of concentrations observed in the study for 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro solu@@ bility . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; 15 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
it is believed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is medi@@ ated in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ GF recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty in swal@@ lowing A@@ bili@@ fy tablets may take the enam@@ el tablets alternatively to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ic@@ idal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorder has been reported in some cases following the beginning , or after replacing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a brain are high fever , muscular rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;

the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible doses above 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;

it is believed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is medi@@ ated in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ GF recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 314 patients and in which the primary study potential &apos; weight gain &apos; was , with significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca . &quot;

A@@ bili@@ fy Inj@@ ection Solution is used for quick control of nutritional and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of Bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deeply into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle by det@@ ecting adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or ac@@ utely ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy sm@@ elt tabl@@ etten or A@@ bili@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with nutritional and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme sed@@ ation or blood pressure drop ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not present for patients with alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , failure disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions prescribed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ asis , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a brain are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness can be observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study , in which healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) was used as an int intr@@ amus@@ cular and the same at the same time Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) were intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after setting the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before starting the accompanying therapy . &quot;

the following side effects occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; 107 The following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) : &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study more than 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % was recommended for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % was treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3,5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and vas@@ cular attacks , undes@@ irable cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mort@@ ality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of Agi@@ ot@@ ion / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , as well as vic@@ ari@@ ousness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant stronger improvement in symptoms regarding the nutritional and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in comparison to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the mean improvement seen from the initial value on the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour final point was 5,@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe bun@@ ting , a similar effectiveness in relation to the total population was observed , but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time trials ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a half @-@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 percent of respon@@ dents considered a response to the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales , which were defined as secondary study targets , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg Dep@@ res@@ sion rates scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the return rate , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 314 patients and in which the primary study potential &apos; weight gain &apos; was , an increase of at least 5.7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which partly over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um mir@@ r@@ oring , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week trial in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ sation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar retreat , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % greater in the first 2 hours following intr@@ amus@@ cular injection : 90 % greater the AU@@ C according to the same dose as a tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time to reach the maximum plasma gas was 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration of a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) which was 15@@ - or 5 times above the maximum human@@ ist exposure of 30 mg intr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly .
&quot; in studies on reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity after intra@@ ven@@ ous application , there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human@@ istic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety @-@ pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproduction toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the car@@ cin@@ ogenic potential , pre@@ clinical data could not detect any particular danger for humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have limited or no importance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects include a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ ergi@@ c toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3- to 10 @-@ times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was as@@ cer@@ tained as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ g@@ ates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 81 @-@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters used to receive an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole purpose or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce the side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; if only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between drugs as time and the deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
it may not be used in patients who are breast@@ feeding or have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) stated that Abra@@ x@@ ane was not recommended for patients in which the first treatment was no longer considered effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , and that in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medications it must not be given to other medicines to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted Bio@@ Science Limited approval for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients , in which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is missing and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see also Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ ron count &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series . &quot;
&quot; in sensor@@ ic neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , treatment is to be interrupted until improvement is achieved to grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there is currently no sufficient data for recomm@@ ending dose adjustments for patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with affected kidney function have been performed and there is currently no adequate data for recomm@@ ending dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of the kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age because of insufficient data to harm@@ fulness and efficacy .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ articles formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have considerably other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately dismis@@ sed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
patients should not be introduced recur@@ r@@ ence cycles until the neut@@ ron count increased again &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count increased again &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven in connection with abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac disease in the indicated patient collective is not un@@ common , especially in patients with early anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or pul@@ mon@@ ary disease . &quot;
&quot; if in patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea , they can be treated with the usual anti @-@ em@@ e@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating means . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , which do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is unavoid@@ able . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised , during and up to six months after the treatment is not a child . &quot;
male patients should be advised before the treatment about a sperm conservation since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ versible in@@ fertility .
abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) that can affect the transport@@ ability and the ability to serve machines .
&quot; listed below are the most common and most important incidents of side effects performed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of abra@@ x@@ ane in pi@@ vot@@ al Phase III study . &quot;
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most con@@ spic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly re@@ versible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects performed in combination with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1.000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased li@@ at@@ ine hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ at@@ ine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced pot@@ assium in the blood heart disease : &quot;

hel@@ pl@@ essness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive associated case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency is possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established . &quot;
&quot; pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ u@@ bul@@ i active substance , which fo@@ sters the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ ze the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by in@@ hibition of their dep@@ ol@@ arization . &quot;
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s the trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and as part of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ um@@ .@@ tor and a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumour occurs due to the alb@@ umen @-@ binding protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by 106 patients in two mon@@ oph@@ onic un@@ blind@@ ed studies and 454 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III trial study .
in one study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane which was given in the form of an inf@@ usion of 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as inf@@ usion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
&quot; this multi @-@ centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in form of solvent containing Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour inf@@ usion with pre@@ medication for prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a negative general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % only had adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; first @-@ line therapy are outlined below .
&quot; neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients , who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during the therapy . &quot;
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to sound bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative Tox@@ ic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses were not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was established in clinical trials .
the active ingredient exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml similar to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 According to intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration commen@@ ced in a multi@@ phase way .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vas@@ cular distribution and / or contrac@@ tion binding of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to an intra@@ ven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 of abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the meth@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available to patients at the age of more than 75 years , because only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability has been proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected by light over 8 hours .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ car@@ cin@@ ogenic medicine and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be treated with caution when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; using a ster@@ ile sy@@ ringe , slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de inf@@ usion solution is inj@@ ected into a Abra@@ x@@ ane pier@@ cing bottle . &quot;
&quot; after complete enc@@ ore of the solution , the pier@@ cing bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid . &quot;
then the pier@@ cing bottle should be turned slowly and carefully for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted until a complete suspension of the powder is eff@@ ected .

member states must ensure that the holder of appro@@ vals for the market launch will provide medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centers and retail stores with the following information and materials :
&quot; • Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging inserts . • With a clear imaging of the correct application of the product , refriger@@ ated boxes for transport through the patients . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also known as &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron levels , in which complications arise in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , in case the blood loss is not possible before the procedure and where a blood loss is expected from 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ be@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make their own blood don@@ ors , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be performed by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received an appropriate guidance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bies should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl with children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron levels of all patients are to be checked before treatment , to ensure that there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
&quot; it is produced by a cell where a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which enables them to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared as injection into a v@@ ein within a major study of 479 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
&quot; all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected for at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a v@@ ein , before they were either converted to ab@@ at@@ amed or still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
the main indicator for the effectiveness was the change in the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period during the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin examined ab@@ at@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values were uph@@ eld in the same degree as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pier@@ cing mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
&quot; ab@@ s@@ amed as injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed , according to the provisions of the European Union , evidence has been demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , ren@@ amed Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medic@@ ines Medic@@ ines Medic@@ ines GmbH &amp; Co KG appro@@ ving the transit of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is based on the general state ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) in case of a large volume of blood volume ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure in adults without iron deficiency where there is a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications . &quot;
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients where hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.8 - 6.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia can be different depending on age , gender and overall disease ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and disease status is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can be observed in one patient or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding can management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permissible dose required for control an@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low h@@ b ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low h@@ b ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using an intra@@ ven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target is reached ( this should take place in increments of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; an@@ emia symptoms and - follow @-@ up changes may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and disease status is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding can management should be attempted to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permissible dose required to control an@@ emia symptoms .
&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the column number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the output value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in rose &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the column number of 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the output value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 treatment weeks with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the column number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be sustained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reverse circulation number increased by &lt; 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ emia ( ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood preser@@ ves is required , ab@@ s@@ amed in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight should be obtained twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery . &quot;
iron sub@@ stitution should be initiated as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - so that large fer@@ ric reserves are available prior to the beginning of the ab@@ re@@ amed therapy .
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre @-@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg in 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis can be given via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ el needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine into the circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from the treatment with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etic at a er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive any ab@@ at@@ amed or another er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients with the following pre@@ - , accompanying or underlying disease : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clusi@@ on , vas@@ cular disease of the car@@ cin@@ oma or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular event . &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ determined PR@@ CA after months and years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of active effect , defined as reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions , the recur@@ rent value should be determined and the usual causes for non @-@ response ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium toxic@@ ation , infection or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated . &quot;
&quot; if the reverse circulation value , taking into account the an@@ emia ( i.e. the &quot; &quot; index &quot; &quot; index ) , is degra@@ ded ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and leu@@ co@@ cy@@ te figures are normal , and if no other reason for active loss is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row to diagnose a PR@@ CA . &quot;
data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of antibody induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not be exceeded under section 4.2 Recomm@@ ended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
in clinical trials an increased risk of mort@@ ality and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating active substances ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit attributed to the administration of epo@@ chs when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration above the concentration required for controlling the an@@ emia symptoms and avoiding blood trans@@ f@@ usions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ d@@ ous cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure should not be exceeded under section 4.2 Recomm@@ ended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
&quot; according to this knowledge , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; for tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa administration and the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin response should be taken into account ( patients that may have to be trans@@ acted ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic an@@ emia - Dos@@ age adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
the decision for applying re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk weighing under the participation of the respective patient which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients en@@ vis@@ aged for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of an@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly prior to the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vas@@ cular disease , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
furthermore it cannot be excluded that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting base level of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vas@@ cular events can exist .
&quot; in several controlled trials , Epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven that tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ emia can improve overall survival or reduce the risk of progression . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted . &quot;
&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dose should be adapted to rising ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of interactions between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF relating to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; over th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vas@@ cular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ em@@ ias , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ cts , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events ( cereb@@ ral blood , brain in@@ far@@ ction ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events ( cereb@@ ral thro@@ mb@@ oses , lung em@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , as well as patients with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , reported . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent rise in blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine treatment .
&quot; regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations can result in th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vas@@ cular complications . &quot;
the gene@@ tically obtained epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and in terms of amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content identical with the end@@ ogen@@ ous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin which was isolated from the urine of an@@ ic patients .
it could be demonstrated with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and not influenced the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
&quot; 389 patients with hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( 221 multiple my@@ el@@ omas , 144 non @-@ H@@ od@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ ost@@ ra@@ ids ) and 332 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 172 mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ cin@@ omas , 23 bron@@ ch@@ ial cell car@@ cin@@ omas , 21 g@@ astro@@ intestinal car@@ cin@@ omas and 30 more ) . &quot;
&quot; 1895 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 6@@ 83 mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ cin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al@@ ar@@ cin@@ omas , 174 gy@@ nec@@ ological tum@@ ors , 300 g@@ astro@@ intestinal tum@@ ours and 47@@ 8 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in . &quot;
survival and tumour progression were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etic patients and patients .
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin treated patients with an@@ a@@ emia due to various common mal@@ ign@@ omas , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mort@@ ality than in the controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin .
&quot; there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are applied to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tin in tumour patients , which are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of transmitt@@ ing a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs after repeated intra@@ ven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life time of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly longer half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um levels achieved after intra@@ ven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no accumulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known comp@@ lication of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be trac@@ ed back to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients , who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa three years ago , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced f@@ ö@@ tal@@ em body weight , leading to a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in fet@@ al mort@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain signature for the clinical situation . &quot;
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed for a maximum period of 3 days outside of the cooling cabinet and not over 25 ° C . &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are equipped with gra@@ ding rings and the filling volume is indicated by a glu@@ ed label , so that if necessary , the dimension of partial quantities is possible . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ be@@ amed must be initiated under supervision of doctors who have experience in the treatment of patients with the above indications .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; 23 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not be exceeded under section 4.2 Recomm@@ ended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .

&quot; 29 In an experimental study involving approximately the 20@@ fold of the weekly dose of the week , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa resulted in reduced f@@ ö@@ tal@@ em body weight , a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in fet@@ al mort@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , there may be a slight dose @-@ dependent rise in the volume of blood within the normal range , which re@@ acts with further treatment . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will perform regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; lack of iron deficiency , dis@@ solution of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 , or foli@@ c acid deficiency should be taken into account and treated before the treatment commen@@ ced . &quot;
very rare was reported on the appearance of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ an after months - until years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ie , it will stop your therapy with ab@@ at@@ amed and determine how your an@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , ab@@ amed amed through inj@@ ections must be given into a v@@ ein ( intra@@ ven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels can be increased and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; in case of elevated or increasing pot@@ assium levels , your doctor can take an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the pot@@ assium levels are back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney disorders and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs by insufficient heart rate , your doctor will make sure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to this knowledge , the treatment of hem@@ at@@ oma with ab@@ s@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa administration and the desired effect should be taken into account for the assessment of the effectiveness of Ab@@ sec@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of red blood pigment ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your ab@@ at@@ amed dose accordingly so as to keep the risk of blood graf@@ ting ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be very carefully weigh@@ ed compared to the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if in the past already th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vas@@ cular events occurred ( e.g. a deep v@@ ein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patients , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances may affect the tumour neg@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; if you have an or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic surgery , the cause of your an@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly prior to treatment . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood pigment ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed because an increased risk of blood drops after surgery is made . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or have recently taken / used even if it is not prescription drugs .
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may need certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF ( G @-@ C@@ SF and GM @-@ C@@ SF are a means for building the immune system , for example with cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your blood poverty ( an@@ a@@ emia ) appe@@ als to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor may need regular blood tests to check and ensure that the medicine works correctly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
&quot; once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of ab@@ at@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed to two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
your doctor may need regular blood tests to check and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .

&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease , which makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause as well as in men . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including those who have recently suffered a minor hip frac@@ ture , as well as in case of inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after inf@@ usion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to treat Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may only be prescribed by physicians who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the first study included nearly 8 000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included two 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies to 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) for six months . &quot;
the main indicator for the effectiveness was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or by at least 75 % compared to the output value .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicine ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ tures , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients with plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less common in repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or one of the other components .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subjected to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the inf@@ usion body and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( dying of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides information material for physicians who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the drug side effects are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited approval for the transport of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a throughout the European Union . &quot;

intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year to treat post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men .
&quot; in patients with low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ tures , the administration of the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by physicians who have experience in treating the Pa@@ get . &quot;
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who have responded to therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient intake of calcium , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of el@@ em@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently received low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a Inf@@ usion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced , by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended since limited clinical experiences are available for this patient group .
&quot; elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary , as bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination are similar to older patients , as with younger patients . &quot;
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age as data are absent for in@@ security and efficacy .
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because only limited clinical experiences exist for this patient population . &quot;
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated before starting treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a by sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient intake of calcium , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of el@@ em@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; canc@@ ers , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , poor oral hygiene , should be considered a dental examination with appropriate preventive dental treatment prior to an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental procedures , no data is available , whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen , shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation in patients receiving A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) were the overall pre@@ val@@ ence of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) undes@@ irable side effects are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic was associated with kidney dysfunction , which expressed itself as a decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase of the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the changes in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a restricted ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical trial for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the A@@ cl@@ ava and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase of the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine within 10 days of administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to 0.8 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , treated patients in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures after a recently acquired hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the inf@@ usion body , such as red@@ ness , swelling and / or pain , ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic area , especially for cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primary in the jaw area ) reported that with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid , were treated . &quot;
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ yel@@ itis and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients following tooth extraction or other dental interventions .
7 study of 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients treated oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area with an A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and a patient treated with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in case of over@@ dosing , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation of calcium and / or intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be compens@@ ated . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was demonstrated with either a bone density value ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 females aged 65 to 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ t @-@ score for the ch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduced risk of frac@@ ture frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a showed a consistent effect over three years , resulting in an increase of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a raised bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ ic acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 Incre@@ ase of bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , the neck @-@ neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
bone hist@@ ology For 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the pool .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ographic ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients in comparison to plac@@ ebo to increase the tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ular bone volume and the preservation of tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ary bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) in ser@@ um and beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in ser@@ um and beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um and beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um and beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um and beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the duration of study . &quot;
the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the output value and was held at 28 % below the initial value to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks before inf@@ usion . &quot;
overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment compared to plac@@ ebo treatment the BM@@ D at all times .
&quot; in comparison to plac@@ ebo treatment , the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment resulted in an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total fragrances and 4.3 % on the threshold . &quot;
clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 508 males were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % in plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was compared with the weekly administration of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at relative to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was studied in patients and patients at the age of 30 with radi@@ ologically verified , especially light to moderate severe Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.@@ 6@@ fold of age @-@ specific upper normal value when recording into the study ) . &quot;
11 The efficacy of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison with the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months has been demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
the combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control compared to the bas@@ eline for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as respon@@ dents at the end of the six @-@ month trial could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the patients participating in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response of 141 patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a could be maintained , compared to 71 of patients treated with frac@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , during an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes of inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ eless . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma bar rapidly decreased &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours followed by a leng@@ thy elimination phase with a termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation period t ½ γ 146 hours . &quot;
the early stages of the process ( α and β ) represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption of the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys .
&quot; in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose can be found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the inf@@ usion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ aci@@ dic concentration by 30 % at the end of inf@@ usion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
&quot; a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance of metaboli@@ zed substances by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ systems is unlikely , because c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irre@@ versible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearance , and was in the 64 patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an even kidney function disorder up to 35 ml / min does not require dos@@ ages of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
&quot; because there are only limited data for severe kidney function disorder ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute Tox@@ ic@@ ity The highest intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of intra@@ ven@@ ous intra@@ ven@@ ous dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0.@@ 6@@ mg / kg body weight .
&quot; for studies in dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the recommended humane @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity in studies with intra@@ ven@@ ous application was given the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats , in a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose , which corresponds to the 6@@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the four@@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , comp@@ lies ) , well toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intra@@ ven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most common finding in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
rats observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity at doses above 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was 0.1 mg / kg due to reduced ser@@ um calcium levels .

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a substance class representative that is called bis@@ phosph@@ onate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially o@@ est@@ ro@@ gens , which are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus , bone reconstruction takes place too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works by norm@@ alising the bone reconstruction , thereby ensuring normal bone formation , and thus gives strength to the bone . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with other medicines , please tell your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you are taking / applying other medicines or have recently taken / used even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a together with food and drink , you are concerned that you have sufficient fluid before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as inf@@ usion in a v@@ ein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to take the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , given to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as inf@@ usion in a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; because A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works for a long time , you may need another dose after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions exactly so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after inf@@ usion .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can work more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is missed , please contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before finishing treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a Falls , please consult your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects associated with the first inf@@ usion are very common ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after the subsequent inf@@ usions . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; currently , it is uncle@@ ar if A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;

patients with recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ tures are recommended to make the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a patients need to be adequately supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic ab@@ normal , hypo@@ kal@@ emia will develop whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient intake of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of el@@ em@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ tures , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. oral or intr@@ amus@@ cular vitamin D is recommended prior to inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the prescription label ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;

&quot; in addition , four studies were conducted to more than 7,@@ 000 patients in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive drug for setting the smoking . &quot;
&quot; the studies on attitudes of smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ compli@@ a was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot;
&quot; what risk is associated with A@@ compli@@ a ? he The most common side effects of A@@ compli@@ a , which during the studies ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) were nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tract . n@@ g The complete listing of the side effects reported in connection with A@@ compli@@ a is the prescription label . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , as it may increase the risk of depression and , among other things , cause depression in a small minority of patients . &quot;

&quot; weight reduction after one year was for A@@ compli@@ a 20 mg 6.5 kg , relative to the initial value , compared to 1.6 kg for the plac@@ ebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4,4 , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ compli@@ a 20 mg , and 1.2 kg in the plac@@ ebo group ( difference -@@ 3.8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4,4 , -@@ 3,@@ 3 ; p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; after 2 years the difference in total weight reduction was between A@@ compli@@ a and plac@@ ebo -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 Weight reduction and other risk factors In the studies in patients without diabetes , in which a mixed population of patients with &quot;
&quot; under Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , an average rate of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de was seen from 6.9 % ( initial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de 1,62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.8 % &quot;
&quot; in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute modification of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.9 % for both groups ) after 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 under plac@@ ebo &quot;
the percentage of patients who reached a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; the difference of mean change in weight between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group was 3.8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2,@@ 6 p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients , who had taken the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , were about 50 % caused by direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and explained about 50 % by weight reduction . n eim Ar@@ z &quot;
&quot; 2 hours , the Ste@@ ady state plasma bars were reached after 13 days ( C@@ MA@@ x = 196 ± 28.@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; C@@ trou@@ gh = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14,@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 268 n@@ g.@@ h / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; food : it subjects who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant either in the so@@ bri@@ ety state or after a fat @-@ rich meal , indicated by 67 % increased C@@ MA@@ x or by 48 % increased n@@ g AU@@ C . &quot;
patients with black skin color can have an up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ x and a 43 % lower AU@@ C as patients of other ethnic populations .
n popularity @-@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analyses ( age range 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year @-@ old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and a 27 % higher AU@@ C has as a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
5.3 Pre@@ clinical data on safety of the following adverse effects that were not observed in clinical trials but were evaluated n@@ g in animals after exposure to the human therapeutic area were considered potentially relevant for clinical application :
&quot; in some , however , not in all cases , the beginning of con@@ vul@@ sions with proced@@ ural stress seems to be associated with animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period prior to p@@ airing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no unwanted effects on the fertility or cycle distur@@ ban@@ ces were observed . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study on rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by lac@@ tation did not cause any changes in learning behavior or memory .

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which is explained how the drug candidate ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) , in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) is not indicated . &quot;
&quot; it can be additionally applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) , which can not be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ ated dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ ins or insulin , the present dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins and insulin can be retained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins and insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , so that type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ Therapy was tested ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ ins , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or Plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos resulted in a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ ins showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional administration of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 289 patients , patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin decreased by 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0,@@ 14 % in patients receiving additional plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ es@@ thesia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to ) to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - ac@@ id@@ ular cone - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with met@@ form@@ in .
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approval for Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar has insufficient insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; no data is available to use Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from at least one risk factor ( e.g. early heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ e@@ dem@@ a , particularly those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under the age of 75 with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease was performed .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output liver Enzy@@ mes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirrors are elevated up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enz@@ ym@@ phs should be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , over@@ breakdown , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dar@@ ker urine , the liver Enzy@@ mes are to be checked . &quot;
the decision whether to continue the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be led to clinical evaluation by the laboratory parameters .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can be stir@@ red by fatty deposits and in some cases is connected to a fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of a hem@@ odi@@ lu@@ tion , a slight reduction of the mean hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on . &quot;
similar changes have been observed in comparative controlled studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as oral two @-@ fold or triple combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d indi@@ a , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , was reported on a occurrence or deteri@@ oration of diab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is uncle@@ ar whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occur@@ ence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , if patients report distur@@ ban@@ ces of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ologic diagnosis should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events with regard to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one &quot;
&quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in the women treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women who were treated with a comparative treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative treatment . &quot;
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs the treatment is canc@@ eled ( see section 4.6 ) .
&quot; studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not exercise any relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; drug interactions that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes such as oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduction are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induction ) resulted in a decrease in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother &apos;s animal is reduced and thereby reduced the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( not estimated from available data ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the lens and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as is also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T asc@@ ents exceeded the three times the upper limit of the normal range , however more rarely compared to plac@@ ebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ har@@ mac@@ euticals . &quot;
in an Out@@ come trial in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease the incidence of severe heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on res@@ p .
&quot; since the market launch , it has rarely been reported on heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , but more often when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated groups and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative treatment . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , leading to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be demonstrated that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral glucose levels in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for more than two years to investigate the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time of two years after treatment , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in 69 % of the patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients below gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for more than 12 months , patients whose blood sugar in spite of the three months optimi@@ zing phase was random@@ ised with insulin , was random@@ ised to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was 0.@@ 45 % , compared to patients receiving insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosing in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ a was shown in clinical trials compared to the bas@@ eline values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical studies , a reduction in the overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel and a slight , however clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the total plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel was detected in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on while under met@@ form@@ in and gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de decreased values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , as well as the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease were random@@ ised in groups that received either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral use , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is rapidly res@@ or@@ bed , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in plasma usually reach 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to effectiveness in approximately the triple of the efficacy of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not have any relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induction ) or decreases the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radio@@ active mark@@ ed Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans the marker was found mainly in f@@ eces ( 55 % ) and reduced to a lower degree in the urine ( 45 % ) .
&quot; the mean plasma elimination lifetime of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and all active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance resem@@ ble themselves . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys in accordance with repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lu@@ tion , an@@ emia and re@@ versible ex@@ centric heart hyper@@ trophy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that , in the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother &apos;s animal dimin@@ ished , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) were induced by the ur@@ inary bladder . &quot;
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d indi@@ ces resulted in increased frequency of col@@ on tum@@ ors .
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat , and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in the women treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women who were treated with a comparative treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative treatment . &quot;
in a further study more than two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were examined with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de .
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ a compared to the bas@@ eline values . &quot;
&quot; in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the po@@ ets tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both of an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study lack@@ ed the target of its primary end@@ point , which presented a combination of total mort@@ ality , non @-@ mort@@ al m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are connected . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat , and carry on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages of unwanted events with regard to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and from more than 7,@@ 400 patients who received comparative medicine showed a higher incidence of frac@@ tures in women . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative treatment . &quot;
&quot; in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the po@@ ets tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both on an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; after 12 weeks , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were similarly strong as with another human insulin . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to remove the prescription label ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane are predomin@@ ant in the treatment of diabetes in relation to the risks .
&quot; October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily when a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; for example , patients whose blood glucose setting has significantly improved by an intensi@@ fied insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin animal origin ) may cause a change in the dosage required . &quot;
&quot; if changing to acet@@ one is necessary in the patient , it may be necessary at first dosing or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over . &quot;
&quot; some patients in which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change of animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than with their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions during the therapy and always ask for his patients other medications taken from them .
&quot; 4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , which may occur in a non @-@ controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent distur@@ ban@@ ces of brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system les@@ ions - Periph@@ eral Neu@@ rop@@ athy A swi@@ ft improvement of blood glucose control can be associated with complaints that are described as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are normally re@@ versible .
5 An intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar setting may however be associated with a temporary wor@@ sen@@ ing of diab@@ etic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and the membrane tissue gel - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy An injection point can develop a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy if missed to change the insertion points within the injection area .
&quot; general conditions and complaints at the location of the administration - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection point Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ ness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ emat@@ oma can occur at the injection point ) . &quot;
&quot; diseases of the immune system les@@ ions - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , ex@@ an@@ them Very rarely - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized skin r@@ ash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , g@@ astro@@ intestinal disorders , cardiac disease , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and impot@@ ence / un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; however , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can be treated by oral intake of glucose or sugar @-@ containing foods . &quot;
&quot; diab@@ e@@ tics should always have grape short@@ ages , sweets , bis@@ cu@@ its or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven help person or by glucose that is administered intra@@ ven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect starts within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration is up to 24 hours . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of spl@@ itting ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were taken into account ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety aspects , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , car@@ cin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data cannot detect any particular danger to humans . &quot;
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane pier@@ cing bottle is taken from the refrigerator - the temperature of the insulin at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) is to be increased before it is res@@ us@@ ur@@ passed according to the manual for the first use .
&quot; some patients in which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change of animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than with their previous insulin . &quot;

&quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients that have already signs of crystal deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or po@@ ds ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , g@@ out attacks can occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients should be taken at least during the first six months of treatment using aden@@ ur@@ ic or other drugs to prevent g@@ out attacks . &quot;
&quot; the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ tran@@ spl@@ ant , as it was not investigated for these groups . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do @-@ drug ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied at a dose of 300 mg once daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg a day . &quot;
the main indicator for effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels were in the blood during the last three measurements below 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of the patients , who took aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of 80 mg once daily , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of the patients , who once daily intake 120 mg , have a ur@@ inary acid level in the blood of under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in any of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and ab@@ normal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular , in patients with heart complaints in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary acid pi@@ eg@@ els in the blood as an allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases , which have already led to urine deposits ( including one out of the clinical history known or currently available po@@ ison no@@ des and / or arthritis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ser@@ um @-@ acid levels are still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be considered on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x a day . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney impair@@ ment , efficacy and safety have not been completely examined ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no experiences in children and adolescents with children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group . &quot;
&quot; since there are no experiences in organ tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure treatment is not recommended with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other non @-@ acid @-@ based medicines , it may result in acute toxic@@ ity during the course of the treatment because by lowering the ser@@ um @-@ acid @-@ pi@@ eg@@ els , ur@@ ic acid deposits can initially be mobili@@ zed in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; B. for mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increase so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 light ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test prior to the beginning of the trial period and in the subsequent course depending on clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in tin was not conducted an exchange rate studies on Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( an in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; subjects were associated with the simultaneous administration of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ exposition ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
in clinical trials the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ hex@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without requiring a dose adjustment for Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient .
&quot; in a study with subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily an average 22 % increase in AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , an CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ at , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of February to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an An@@ ta@@ zi@@ du@@ ms containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de , the recording of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) delayed and a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not be close to side effects of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; experimental studies do not lead to direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or performing hazardous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC is not det@@ ri@@ mental to their performance . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient @-@ years ) , there was no statisti@@ cally significant differences found , and no caus@@ al correlation with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at could be found . &quot;
the risk factors determined in these patients were an arter@@ i@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could be present in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all February @-@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below . &quot;
diar@@ rhe@@ a and v@@ om@@ iting are more common in patients treated with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials no severe r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
&quot; 7 open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , in 322 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the reported treatment @-@ related events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the subsequent treatment @-@ related events were reported in all February @-@ ost@@ at@@ - treatment groups more than once and appeared in patients who received Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient @-@ years ) , according to the indications . &quot;
the subsequent treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 either at all or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hyp@@ es@@ thesia , eye @-@ cat@@ er@@ edness , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , r@@ ash concentration in the blood , decline of the concentration concentration in the blood , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
ur@@ ic acid is the final product of pur@@ in@@ metabolic and arises as part of the Re@@ action sk@@ as@@ k@@ ade Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
&quot; Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for the in vitro fertili@@ zation , which is below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area . &quot;
&quot; clinical trial results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
&quot; the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study the percentage of patients , where the last three month @-@ specific ser@@ um @-@ acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were . &quot;

the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the conven@@ tionally used Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of the ser@@ um resin acid track to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the physician attendance in week 2 and maintained permanently throughout the treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( d. h .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) . &quot;
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage return of ser@@ um @-@ acid concentrations in subjects regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe ren@@ al dys@@ functions ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um @-@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl ei@@ tw@@ a 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data obtained in two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the ser@@ um @-@ acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of toxic@@ ity ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients required no treatment against a toxic@@ ity ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the amount of gyp@@ sum , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the ven@@ ous no@@ des until month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the plasma concentration period ( AU@@ C ) increased propor@@ tion@@ ately from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at after administration easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at that is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ MA@@ x amounts approximately 2,8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decline of ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration was observed , provided that was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma data binding of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is about 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding on alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es , these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are mainly formed by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide is created mainly by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , about 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ modified Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , around 45 % of the dose in the chair also found itself as un@@ changing Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; specific patient groups of kidney failure after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
the medium overall AU@@ C from Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased about the 1.8 @-@ fold from 7.5 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g ⋅ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 liver function constra@@ int After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ - Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) liver function restriction changed the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C from February ux@@ ost@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes in terms of the AU@@ C of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ors ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed group , with about 11 times the exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ ating and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .

&quot; the data obtained in two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of the ser@@ um @-@ acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of toxic@@ ity ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients required no treatment against a toxic@@ ity ) . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( disease in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already being used separately in medicines , which are approved in the European Union , the company presented data that originate from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who took exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also presented data showing that the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose , contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , is exactly the dose required for preventing bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , de@@ con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( swal@@ lowing ) , dri@@ fting ab@@ dom@@ es ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) , as well as sau@@ res . &quot;
&quot; in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against algae ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 , or any of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in case of diseases of es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;

&quot; capsule shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or intake of medicines ( including an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following indications are to be observed precisely to reduce the risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or break the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
&quot; pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except ph@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , only be given with special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al wounds , were reported in patients under the ing@@ es@@ tion of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly these were severe and required a hospital brief@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore alert all signs and symptoms that point to possible mal@@ ign@@ ant reactions , and patients should be noted in the occurrence of symptoms of mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or mer@@ ci@@ ary heart@@ burn the medicine seek and obtain medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
3 The risk of serious mal@@ ign@@ ant side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that point to a mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was detected , rare ( after market launch ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ zer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ yel@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regime predominantly contains intra@@ ven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ onate . &quot;
there are no data available to indicate whether the setting of a bis@@ phosph@@ onate therapy in patients who need a sl@@ ate surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy plan in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted to take the tablet the next morning when taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE once they have noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the dose of one tablet a week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm ) should also be treated adequately before the treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some oral medicines may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , after taking Al@@ end@@ ron , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
&quot; animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate leave no indication of directly dam@@ aging effects in regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw has been reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports come from cancer patients , but also for oste@@ opor@@ osis patients . &quot;
&quot; however , the ser@@ um @-@ calcium levels of up to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and ser@@ um phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ( 0.65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were observed in both treatment groups with a similar frequency . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at In@@ follow an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract , such as stomach up@@ set , heart@@ burn , es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , gast@@ ri@@ tis , or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;

&quot; the main effect of 1.25 D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D3 is the increase of the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate , as well as the regulation of ser@@ um calcium , the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ idi@@ sm , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ ie , can result in increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures for oste@@ opor@@ otic persons . &quot;

the effects of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ tures in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 459 ) .
&quot; in Phase III trials , the mean asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 10 mg / day compared to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.8 % on the spine , 5.8 % at the fem@@ ur and 7.8 % at the trou@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 3.2 % versus plac@@ ebo 6.6 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures . &quot;
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of the spine and the tro@@ chan@@ ter continued ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the whole body was maintained .
&quot; it consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials , where Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily administration of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ rate by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.9 % versus plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption coated on an intra@@ ven@@ ous reference dose was the mean or@@ al bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fast@@ ings and two hours before reception of a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to around 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken half an hour before a standardis@@ ed breakfast .
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ath was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) showed no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 distribution studies on rats showed that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is temporarily divided into female tissues after an intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg , but is then rapidly spread in the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot;
&quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion After an intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , approximately 50 % of the radio@@ active substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the fa@@ eces . &quot;
&quot; after an intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was 71 ml / min and the systemic clearance does not exceed 200 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the aci@@ dic or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kid@@ neys , and therefore it is not assumed that the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines is affected by these transport systems . &quot;

the mean maximum concentration in the ser@@ um ( C@@ MA@@ x ) of vitamin D3 was 5.@@ 9 n@@ g / ml and the medi@@ an time until reaching the maximum level of ser@@ um ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
&quot; biot@@ ran@@ s@@ formation vitamin D3 is rapidly hydro@@ xi@@ ated in the liver and then metaboli@@ zed in the kidney to 1.25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 , the bi@@ ologically active form . &quot;
&quot; elimination of radio@@ activity marked vitamin D3 in healthy subjects was the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours 2.4 % , in cases after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of Al@@ end@@ ron , which is not depos@@ ited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted from urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available , it is nevertheless likely to be expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate as in animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced ren@@ al function . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with reduced ren@@ al function a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate in bones can be expected ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; article is administered to adult patients , which a kidney or liver has been transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system . &quot;
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant , whereby the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ tation was gra@@ ded after a year of treatment ( for example investigating how often a renewed organ tran@@ spl@@ ant or res@@ um@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
&quot; in addition , shorter further studies were conducted on 119 patients with kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is included in comparison with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body . &quot;
&quot; trem@@ ors ( trem@@ ors ) , head@@ ache , nau@@ sea / v@@ om@@ iting , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , diabetes , increased pot@@ assium content ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients may not be applied . &quot;
patients and doctors must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines will be taken at the same time using an Adv@@ agra@@ ph as the dosage or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adapted accordingly .
&quot; hard capsules , re@@ tar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange gel capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule top with &quot; &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; &quot; and on the orange capsule bottom with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ tation patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or an increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; changes in formulation or regime should only be carried out under tight control of an experienced physician ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of lawyer should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level provisions ( see below ) recommendations
&quot; after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks should be controlled before switching and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 , systemic exposure was comparable with both form@@ ulations , both in kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks are recommended during the first two weeks of transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ ph to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate tran@@ spl@@ ant phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clearance , an adaptation of the lawyer can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral intake of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be induced intra@@ ven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate on the production of an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application In the suppression of tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given . &quot;
dose recommendations - K@@ id@@ ney transplan@@ tation Proph@@ yla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection The oral Christmas treatment should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning . &quot;
further dose adjustments may be necessary later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change during the stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ tation .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation Proph@@ yla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection The oral Advent treatment should begin with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must undergo a tran@@ spl@@ ant receiver of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f Cap@@ sules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ ant@@ f , so this conversion has to be done in a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day the treatment must begin with the oral initi@@ al@@ dosis that is recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection .
&quot; transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are converted to an Adv@@ agra@@ ph , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day . &quot;
&quot; other tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers , although there is no clinical experience with regard to lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ts , occurred at an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and for intestinal gra@@ fts in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dose adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function In patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a reduction of the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions .
&quot; patients with reduced ren@@ al function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um car@@ cin@@ omas , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
conversion of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f At the conversion from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the face mirror in the whole blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of impact and toler@@ ability in individual cases involving the help of full blood tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low levels .
it is recommended to conduct frequent checks of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low levels during the first two weeks of transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood @-@ level mirror should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ age adjustment , modification of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while using substances that could alter the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since you are a drug with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the level of seb@@ um in the blood is 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice the tal@@ low levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are usually in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in kidney and heart @-@ transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were usually used . &quot;
&quot; this led to serious adverse events , including tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection or other side effects , which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; changes in formulation or regime should only be carried out under tight control of an experienced physician ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
for proph@@ yla@@ xis of tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection in adult heart tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers and tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers in childhood there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
&quot; because of possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus mirror in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical impact of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements , the Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may contain , or other herbal remedies during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful observation of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases under Pro@@ gra@@ f , a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy has been observed as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , which is therefore also possible under Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical distur@@ ban@@ ces are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid pollution and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin les@@ ions caused by appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , show symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ ache , altered state of consciousness , cr@@ amps and vision distur@@ ban@@ ces , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. &quot;
&quot; as Adv@@ agra@@ f Hart@@ ap@@ sules , re@@ tar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose , contains special caution in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary g@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , and consequently raise or lower blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood level in the simultaneous gift of substances that can alter the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain even more uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction has been associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ic like k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels resulted primarily from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of g@@ astro@@ intestinal diges@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as used in acute drop @-@ off reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ mates ; hence , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may affect their metabolism . &quot;
&quot; as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills and thus increase the hor@@ m@@ onal exposure , it is particularly careful in making decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of animal testing have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could potentially reduce the clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and pro@@ long its half @-@ value .
the results of a low number of transplan@@ tation patients have no indication that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born suggests potential dam@@ aging effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kid@@ neys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va can often be detected because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; in the following , side effects are performed after their frequency in descending order : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on the available data is not in@@ valuable ) . &quot;

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases How well known in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often raised in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( vir@@ ale , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , prot@@ o@@ zo@@ ale ) . &quot;
&quot; cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ k@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; it has been reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms , including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative disorders and skin tum@@ ors in conjunction with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water solu@@ bility and high bonding to er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can not be di@@ aly@@ zed . &quot;
effective mechanism and phar@@ ma@@ ko@@ dynamic effects on molecular level should medi@@ ate the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ olic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular memory .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ depend@@ ant inhibit@@ ing of signal trans@@ duc@@ ts in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a specific series of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of the B cells dependent on the T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 recep@@ tor . &quot;

&quot; lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi @-@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , over 110 patients were reported that received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within a 1 : 1 random@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; chronic tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ate syndrome , was less frequent in the first year after the tran@@ spl@@ ant ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus it occurred in 21.@@ 7 % of cases for the formation of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans compared to 38.@@ 0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be switched to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients affected by Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection , was larger after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.7 % versus 45.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 33.@@ 3 % ) in the patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Tran@@ spl@@ ant 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
in a study the incidence of the formation of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ate syndrome was significantly lower in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
P@@ ank@@ re@@ ast@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation A multi @-@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed at 205 patients who were simultaneously treated as pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation following random@@ ised Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached after reaching the target level of 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml at 5 .
&quot; in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ cal transplan@@ ts ) under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row aug@@ mentation , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , which lead to seb@@ harmony between 10 and 15 n@@ g / ml and recently tran@@ spl@@ ant radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as low ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit value and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the in@@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism induced by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids should be responsible for the higher Clear@@ ance rates observed after transplan@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done via the bile . &quot;
&quot; for stable patients who have been converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice a day ) to the total daily dose , the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f . &quot;
it is recommended to conduct frequent checks of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low levels during the first two weeks of transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
&quot; 21 For the treatment of adult patients with tran@@ spl@@ ant rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;

advoc@@ ates are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether advances in the treatment of bleeding or preventing hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages in surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but manufactured according to a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which enables them to form the human Ger@@ inn@@ ate factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ ates are similar to another in the European Union , called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced differently , so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined for preventing bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ances in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new bleeding sep@@ ti@@ des with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; was evaluated . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ance ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ ates may not be applied in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to the human Ger@@ inn@@ ungs@@ factor VIII , mouse or hamster protein or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG a permit for the launching of Adv@@ ances throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ deficiency , according to the location and the extent of the bleeding and clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , factor VIII @-@ activity should not fall under the indicated plasma bar ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repe@@ ating until the pain and acute depression are removed .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients 6 years ) until the risk of the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment process , the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections should be recommended to determine the factor VIII @-@ plasma quality . &quot;
&quot; in their response to factor VIII , individual patients may differ in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value periods . &quot;
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. from factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to prove if necessary an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that factor VIII @-@ therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
&quot; the feed speed should be adjusted after finding the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known comp@@ lication in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII @-@ directed Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml of plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da ass@@ ay .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 composition days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure positions and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known in@@ hibition , mig@@ rating from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product was observed on another , the recur@@ r@@ ence of ( low tide ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences in the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the patients appearing in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , all treated in previously untreated patients who have higher risk of formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not in@@ valuable ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of each patient ( 234 ) . the unexpected apost@@ asy of the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE inf@@ usion .
the blood cl@@ ots were maintained throughout the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values on 15 postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed he@@ avier to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient after 26 exposure positions with A@@ DV@@ ATE showed a low inhibit@@ ory ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
&quot; moreover , in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed with moderate to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) , a F@@ VIII @-@ inhibit@@ or was established . &quot;
&quot; in previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical trial , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated patients treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of the patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibody ti@@ ter against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise no signs or symptoms displayed on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , the incidence of Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes was reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder for 5 years should request another extension procedure . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited conven@@ ed the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company accepts his application for the marketing of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer .
&quot; normally , however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that bin@@ ds and supports other structures in the body ) are affected . &quot;
this is a kind of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; that has been modified so that there are no copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable cancer cells to recre@@ ate the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein produced from the p@@ 53 gene , which is not defective in the human body , is normally carried out to restore damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient prior to the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the abdom@@ en , bone and brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP checked the answers of the company to the questions asked , some questions were still uncle@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; based on the evaluation of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP will create a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in inj@@ ections in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Tum@@ ore brings benefits to patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; &quot; Comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ Use &quot; &quot; programmes with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot;
&quot; changed drug release &quot; means that the tablets are set together so that one of the effective ingredients will be released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours .
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever , caused by an allergy to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; in adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of aer@@ os@@ ine is twice daily a tablet that should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ amped . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be trac@@ ed to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficiency measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the h@@ ay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to treatment and during 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients had their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; when considering all h@@ ay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients reported the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were reported by a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was observed , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a decrease of the symptoms by 3@@ 8.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who took deser@@ ters alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die ( heart ch@@ ase ) , m@@ d@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to di@@ lor@@ at@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other components , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lor@@ at@@ ine ( another medicine for treating allergi@@ es ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ os@@ yn@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients suffering from glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart or vas@@ cular diseases , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ rhe@@ a ) , or a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval for the placing of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without shred@@ ding , dis@@ rup@@ ting or ch@@ ew@@ ing ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data to harm@@ fulness and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use duration to 10 days , as long @-@ term application can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy if necessary . &quot;
&quot; as aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors respectively within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ mp@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , li@@ mel@@ amine , dy@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ in , eph@@ edr@@ ine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ ha@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data do not suff@@ ice to prono@@ unce appropriate recommendations for the dosage .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of aer@@ os@@ ols have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver function , and the data do not suff@@ ice to prono@@ unce appropriate recommendations . &quot;
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment should be canc@@ eled in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nau@@ sea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or strengthening head@@ aches ) . &quot;
&quot; patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction in an@@ am@@ nes@@ is , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder stru@@ t or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m in the an@@ am@@ nes@@ is . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is available at least 48 hours before conducting der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or to reduce their degree . &quot;
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine were observed . &quot;
&quot; the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , but experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies did not raise the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency in the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tor properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a di@@ zz@@ iness which may result in impair@@ ment of the transport@@ ability or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( sed@@ ation , ap@@ nea , reduced mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ ors , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tu@@ als . &quot;
&quot; head@@ ache , anxiety , frigh@@ tening mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ innitus , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ al pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces , hyper@@ tension , or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ NS stimulation is most likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ il stiff@@ ness and - dil@@ ation , skin irrit@@ ation , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es , as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ Sel@@ ec@@ tin to end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in an individual dose study with adults , Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the alignment , including the reinforcement of subjective complic@@ ity or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily did not detect increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage may cause other sympath@@ om@@ ic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1.@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; both studies were the antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total score for the symptoms ( except for nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ) , significantly higher than under mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine during the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ os@@ yn@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under mon@@ otherapy with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze Tablets showed no significant differences with regard to sex , age or ethnic origin . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ or@@ tic application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow balance of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet of healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects were badly metaboli@@ zed . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine bi@@ valent was for exposure after the gift of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety aspects , toxic@@ ity in repeated use , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity , however , the pre@@ clinical data with the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may not detect any particular danger for humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination did not contain any greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
in reproductive @-@ st@@ ox@@ ic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits at a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

&quot; after the launch of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine , very rarely reported cases of severe allergic reactions ( breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or r@@ ashes . &quot;
&quot; in cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , stomach pain , nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , stomach pain , diar@@ rho@@ ea , di@@ zz@@ iness , in@@ som@@ nia with increased physical activity , over cases of liver inflammation and over cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver values has also been reported very rarely . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ s@@ ate ( soluble tablets ) , 2.5 M@@ g@@ - and 5 mg @-@ melting pills ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake . &quot;
&quot; for children aged 1 to 5 , the dose is 1.25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged 6 to 11 , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness was measured by determining the variation of the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rants , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six @-@ weeks treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the melting pills in the same way as the tablets and the application in children are harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergy r@@ hin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of the symptom scores after six weeks treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 and 33 % compared to the patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine , lor@@ at@@ adin or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe approval for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; once a day , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical studies to efficacy in the application of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ins in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the present disease progression and can be res@@ um@@ ed after the symptoms of the symptoms .
in the pers@@ ist allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient may be recommended during the allergy @-@ time an ongoing treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been detected in clinical trials with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole have additionally been administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may come to benefit that may result in impair@@ ment of the transport@@ ability or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies in different indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most frequently encountered side effects reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial of 5@@ 78 young patients aged 12 to 17 , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine and at 6.9 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , in which up to 45 mg dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine ( nine clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es , as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ Sel@@ ec@@ tin to end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses in the des@@ ol@@ at@@ ine in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ oplas@@ m of clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no leng@@ th@@ ening of the Q@@ t@@ c interval appeared . &quot;
&quot; in an individual dos@@ e- study with adults , Dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measuring parameters of the alignment , including the reinforcement of subjective complic@@ ity or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as ni@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ itis can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as a occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ isti@@ ble allergic r@@ hin@@ itis is defined as symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown in the questionn@@ aire regarding the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ Con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was exam@@ in@@ able for further forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the eti@@ ology in the different forms and can be recru@@ ited by chronic patients . &quot;
&quot; since the hi@@ stam@@ ine release is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine also leads to an improvement in symptoms in other forms of the early anti@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines , were excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo in comparison to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patient &apos;s demo@@ s were comparable to the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis population , a higher concentration of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily application of di@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely ruled out . &quot;
dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine inhi@@ bits in vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
&quot; in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not respond to the availability of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the pre @-@ clinical studies conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on security sp@@ ar ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity , the pre@@ clinical data with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine does not recognize any particular danger to humans . &quot;

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available which support a treatment of inf@@ ectious r@@ hin@@ itis with a@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; apart from the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ nes@@ is , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metaboli@@ ze dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ins and experience higher substance levels ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ ups in children between 2 and 11 years , which metaboli@@ ze limited metabolism is identical to those with children , which metaboli@@ se normally . &quot;
&quot; this drug contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients should not take this medicine with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ cro@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole have additionally been administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group like the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us were reported than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , in which up to 45 mg dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine ( nine clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children between the ages of 1 and 11 , who were eligible for an anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy , received a daily distill@@ ation dose of 1.25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ ol@@ at@@ ine in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ oplas@@ m of clinical dosage ) was applied over ten days in adults , there was no leng@@ th@@ ening of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents was observed no higher incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents conducted in clinical trials do not distur@@ b the psych@@ omot@@ or .
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither an increase in alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment nor an increase of drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adults and you@@ thful patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as ni@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the questionn@@ aire regarding the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ Con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets decrease effectively by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ itis to limited metabolism .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ value of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient coll@@ ulation after daily application of di@@ lor@@ at@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 different single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values were comparable to pedi@@ atric patients in the recommended doses with those of adults who received the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;

the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets during the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
the overall incidence of side effects between the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and plac@@ ebo group was the same and did not devi@@ ate significantly from the safety profile established in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el tablets proved as a bio@@ equi@@ val@@ ence to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ ophi@@ li@@ sat for dimin@@ ishing formulation of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ine . &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.A. granted approval to the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company accepts his application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people for protection against flu , which is caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus . &quot;
this is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus emerges , which can easily spread from human to human , because human beings have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognizes the parts of the flu virus as &quot; &quot; physical @-@ foreign &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the immune system will later be able to make a contact with an influ@@ enza virus of this pedi@@ gree of fast antibodies . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane shell of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body det@@ ects as a body foreign ) was separated , adjusted and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
an inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
the scope of the clinical data basis for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for prev@@ ent@@ ative vacc@@ ines .
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ generate is available as a solution for intake , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; as@@ generations should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked out which anti@@ viral medicines the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood is that the virus is addressed to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice a day , which can be taken together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines twice a day . &quot;
&quot; in children aged between 4 and 12 years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of a@@ are is based on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , am@@ an@@ asis decreases the HIV quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS cannot cure , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who previously had not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the medication used with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r has been compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 206 adults , who used earlier prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator for effectiveness was the percentage of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( virus load ) or the viral load change after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ a , more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml than plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gen@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults treated earlier with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the viral load increased by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r after 16 @-@ weeks treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gen@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to get stronger rub@@ b@@ ish of viral load after four weeks compared to patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of as@@ generations ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , r@@ ash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ a must not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
&quot; am@@ an@@ asis may not be used in patients , Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( a herbal preparation for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are just as well degra@@ ded and in high concentrations in the blood are harmful to health . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ generating immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of am@@ generation in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were out@@ weigh@@ ed over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; as a rule , am@@ an@@ asis is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of am@@ an@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven . &quot;
&quot; it was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited approval for the transport of gases throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are to be administered for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are used without the rein@@ forcing additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of am@@ an@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of ather@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children . &quot;
&quot; it is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data to harm@@ fulness and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ a capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction at 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
it is not permitted simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ y@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy will not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ather@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmitt@@ ing HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ generate capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal progression .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialized information of these medicines . &quot;
patients with prior @-@ restricted liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show increased incidence of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ a and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ or@@ tic o@@ ids , which are metaboli@@ zed via CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment predomin@@ ates the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the metabolism of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of alpha @-@ gases with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
patients who take this medicine at the same time can be less effective because of reduced plasma bars ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hor@@ m@@ onal contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the potential risk of a toxic@@ ity due to the high Prop@@ ylene gly@@ col@@ o@@ hal@@ ts of the A@@ gener@@ a solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; ather@@ ase should be reduced to 5 , if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases to which therapy drugs were needed to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; higher age , and with drug depend@@ ant factors , like a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
hem@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ sis .
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections that lead to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eth@@ ology is assumed ( including using cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body @-@ mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width can not be given simultaneously with medicines , which have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ y@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be used together with medicines whose agents are mainly metaboli@@ zed via CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
attempting to compens@@ ate the degra@@ ded plasma bar by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were very often observed adverse effects on the liver .
Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um Mir@@ rors of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be lowered by the simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with Johann@@ is@@ Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; when a patient already adop@@ ts Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut , the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ spiegel and , if possible , check the viral load and canc@@ els the Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
&quot; 508 % increased , on the other hand , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , dosage of 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily applied to demonstrate the efficacy and harm@@ fulness of this treatment regim@@ en . &quot;
52 % decreases if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended , as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the fan@@ ci@@ dal component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the proceeds of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and as@@ generations are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) no dose adaptation is required . &quot;
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be lower .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin possibly lowers the Ser@@ um@@ conc@@ ation of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if this medicine should be used at the same time , caution is advised because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma quality . &quot;
&quot; if these medicines are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical surveillance should be carried out as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus an increase of side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to meet ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with ather@@ ase , the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with am@@ an@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out ; however the plasma bar of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice a day 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may , if applied together with as@@ generations , may lead to interactions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these drugs , if they are used in combination with ather@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as ather@@ ase because it can come to res@@ or@@ ption distur@@ ban@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va , known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a humili@@ ation of the plasma bars of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@
&quot; simultaneous intake with a@@ gen@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and intensi@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in combination with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the end@@ ogen@@ ous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ a with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ or@@ tic o@@ ids unless the potential benefit of a treatment predomin@@ ates the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma bars are expected at con@@ current administration of ather@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; as plasma gas increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to my@@ opathy , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to monitor therapeutic concentrations as far as stabili@@ zing the mirror , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased in simultaneous offering of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it should not be applied along with oral mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while simultaneous use of gases with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am should be taken care of . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma bar of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am for the 3- to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium removal symptoms , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the slight negli@@ gence of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given , as am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in the simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with ather@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hor@@ m@@ onal contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predic@@ tible , therefore also alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for simultaneous use of as@@ generations ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of potential benefits for the mother in comparison with possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk lac@@ ing rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether pren@@ avi@@ r is over@@ flowing with people in breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the invasion of the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during follow @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; the further development of seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother @-@ animal . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of am@@ an@@ asis was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ a treatment were mild to moderate , appeared early and rarely lead to treatment . &quot;
&quot; many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the intake of am@@ an@@ asis or any other medicine applied at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects mentioned below come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not pre@@ treated patients received 1200 mg of am@@ el@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
events ( grade 2 to 4 ) which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators than in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients as well as under the treatment of any laboratory alter@@ ations ( grade 3 to 4 ) .
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fast fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ trophy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ dic fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ untreated individuals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( sti@@ ckers ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 in 245 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) in comparison to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients with in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ ular pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and spontane@@ ously occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontane@@ ously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV @-@ disease or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients receiving 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day along with low dose p@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory alter@@ ations ( Grade 3 and 4 ) which were observed among patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very common . &quot;
&quot; in the case of an over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary supporting measures . &quot;

&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blast cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ aus@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment regim@@ ens were observed with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely . &quot;
&quot; in the sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ untreated patients who received 700@@ mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , did not appear pre@@ treated patients , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 77@@ I , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 trial and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) , patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based analyses of gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to additional data and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
&quot; based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretations can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for ass@@ essing the activity of pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( separ@@ ators ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret results for resistance testing . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic pattern creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance trails , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ untreated patients , with which a fossil @-@ ra@@ dish @-@ containing scheme was ens@@ hr@@ ined ( one of them showed resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 3 of 25 isol@@ ates ) , ar cavi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early departure of a fail@@ ing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which may affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ a in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which with PI pre @-@ treated adults after vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cle@@ osi@@ dan@@ ger@@ a ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to ather@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis demonstrated the non @-@ sub@@ ordination of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group with regard to the time @-@ ad@@ mis@@ adjusted average change from the output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks with a non @-@ lower threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
evidence of the effectiveness of un@@ bi@@ ased gases is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ a solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg is three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2,5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; there was not a low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value . &quot;
19 Based on this data should be considered in the therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ born &quot; as@@ generations .
&quot; after oral administration , the mean duration ( T@@ max ) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % ex@@ alted , for C@@ MA@@ x , by contrast , reduced by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal results in a 25 % decrease of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the scale and rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l@@ tr ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active ingredient in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ents during the dosage interval varies depending on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may be administered with caution when they are given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of A@@ gener@@ a capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ availability than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gen@@ ase solution and am@@ el@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , so the effect of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment regim@@ ens lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma mirrors comparable to those achieved in healthy subjects according to a dosage of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on the car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats occurred in male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas in doses , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is uncle@@ ar .
&quot; however , there were little evidence of the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ation test on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ ated nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and detected in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ate gases . &quot;
&quot; so far , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of gases nor after the treatment . &quot;
studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality both in the inspection as well as in the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in a systemic plasma exposition , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus on@@ gation and minor skel@@ etal changes have been observed which indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the rein@@ forcing additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of am@@ an@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated in patients with severe liver dysfunction ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; ather@@ ase should be reduced to 27 , if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk for li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy has been associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug depend@@ ant factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
&quot; 508 % increased , on the other hand , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended , as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be lower .
&quot; if these medicines are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical surveillance should be carried out as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to meet ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin along with ather@@ ase , the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@
&quot; in a clinical trial , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the end@@ ogen@@ ous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with ather@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg est@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) resulted in a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of potential benefits for the mother in comparison with possible risks for fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the invasion of the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during follow @-@ up . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of am@@ an@@ asis was studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in the case of an over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary supporting measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blast cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ aus@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r re@@ tains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on this data , therapy optimisation should be considered with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ born &quot; as@@ generations . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ents during the dosage interval varies depending on the overall drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit or inhi@@ bit CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may be administered with caution when they are given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on the car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas in doses , which correspon@@ ded to 2.0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the formation of the h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ele aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is uncle@@ ar .
&quot; from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications , however , there were little evidence of the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;

studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality both in the inspection as well as in the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; these results suggest that in young , the metabolism routes are not yet fully mature , so that Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
&quot; the benefits of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; P@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase solution for intake was not occupied with PI pre @-@ treated patients nor with PI pre @-@ treated patients . &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should , as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution to stop ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , since there is no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ a solution for taking and low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination should be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adap@@ tion for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ a solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ col@@ ge@@ hal@@ ts , A@@ gen@@ ase solution is indicated for inf@@ ants and children under 4 years , with pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
the simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gen@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy will not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ather@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; ather@@ ase should be canc@@ eled for duration if a skin r@@ ash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk for li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy has been associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with medi@@ um@@ - 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
hem@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ sis .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and resistance development .
&quot; 508 % increased , on the other hand , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with a@@ gen@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and lead to P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;

&quot; the application frequency and duration of treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas , the cream is up to a maximum of 16 weeks a week . • In case of small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas , it is up to a maximum of 16 weeks a week . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered to the affected areas of skin , so that they remain on the skin for a long time ( approximately eight hours ) before being washed off . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and carried out Al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo every day or five times a week .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies to 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phi@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phi@@ c ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;

&quot; treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is so long to continue until all visible f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ an@@ al region , or up to 16 weeks for each treatment period . &quot;
inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are healed completely , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose was om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she noticed it and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is applied in a thin layer and put in the puri@@ fied ones infected with f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces infected skin area until the cream is completely re@@ trac@@ ted .
it should take a consideration in these patients between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible dis@@ appearance of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take a balance between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft vs. host response .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily Pre@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and one case with one to the circumc@@ ision leading stri@@ pe . &quot;
&quot; when applying I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irrit@@ ation has been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused by temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied funds for the treatment of external f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces in the genital and peri@@ an@@ al@@ gia , there are no clinical experiences yet . &quot;
&quot; limited data points to an increased rate of f@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen@@ ia reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream showed a lower effectiveness in this patient group regarding the elimination of f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not examined . &quot;
local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions usually decreases during the therapy or the reactions are formed after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s dis@@ comfort or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy may be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since no data is currently available on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be taken into consideration in super@@ fi@@ denti@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre@@ treated BC@@ Cs , there are no clinical experiences , so the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial indicate that large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lips . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support effectiveness in this application , so such an application is not recommended . &quot;
local skin reactions occur frequently but these reactions usually take in the course of the therapy of intensity or go back after sett@@ ling the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if the local skin reactions to the patient are causing large dis@@ comfort or are very strong , treatment can be suspended for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 acts showed less complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune stimul@@ atory properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no direct or indirect adverse effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , band@@ aging or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after one @-@ time nor after several top@@ ical application of quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the most frequently shared and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local responses at the site of treatment of the f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces ( 33.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most commonly reported and most likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include complaints at the application place with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of Phase III are shown below .
the most common as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the related side effect were in these studies a response at the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
side effects reported by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; according to the test plan , this evaluation of the clinical signs shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream often encountered local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ex@@ cor@@ i@@ ation / descent ( 23 % ) and oil ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the test plan , this evaluation of clinical signs shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream very often caused severe Er@@ y@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and to severe shred@@ ding and c@@ abling ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies investigating the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was determined with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the accidental oral intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags may lead to nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intra@@ ven@@ ous liquid . &quot;
&quot; after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , increasing systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines have been detected in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigations . &quot;
&quot; in 3 phase @-@ relevant Phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy was clearly superior to a complete healing of the f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment . &quot;
patients treated 60 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od were treated completely ; this was in case of 20 % of the 105 with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI ) :
&quot; a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five @-@ time use per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fi@@ cial bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment time of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free time period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phi@@ c , non @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phi@@ c ac@@ - les@@ ions within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the hair@@ less scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
the one @-@ year data from two combined observations show a recur@@ r@@ ence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) after one or two treatment times .
&quot; the approved indications for external f@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fi@@ denti@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma usually do not occur and were therefore not investigated . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies with children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies at the doses studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed in the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1,6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated obvious half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ time after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low according to top@@ ical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and was comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fi@@ ber@@ ant bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity at the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg body resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ leen weight ; a study conducted for four months has yiel@@ ded no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in three days per week induced no tum@@ ours in the application area .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od is only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , is a risk for humans due to systemic exposure as very low . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice treated with the free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;

tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist / pharmac@@ ist immediately if you don &apos;t feel comfortable while applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
&quot; if your skin respon@@ ds too much to the treatment with al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream to wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; a lower number of blood cells can make you more sus@@ cep@@ tible to infection ; it can cause a blue stain , or it can cause degra@@ dation . &quot;
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you are significantly imp@@ aired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use @-@ information .
&quot; furthermore , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of the patients ) , burning ( 26 % of the patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of the patients ) . &quot;
&quot; most of these are lighter skin reactions , which sound again within approximately 2 weeks after the treatment is removed . &quot;
&quot; occasionally some patients notice changes in the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , de@@ formation , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nau@@ sea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and ti@@ red@@ ness . &quot;

Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerve ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amine gly@@ col , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neurolog@@ ical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements difficult , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
&quot; the dosage of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ bu@@ zz@@ ing equipment , and patients may need appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; the study was primarily examined by the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining its effect regarding the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me reduced the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in patients at the age of over five ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , skin r@@ ash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the inf@@ usion body . &quot;
&quot; frequent side effects in patients below five years of age are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measure of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me may not be applied strongly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known , and if necessary update this summary . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me manufactures patients who receive Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me about the reactions to inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. to appro@@ ve the transport of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union . &quot;
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α -@@ L I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese hamster ov@@ vary , Eier@@ stock of the Chinese hamster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients . &quot;
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me can develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect occurring during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which rehabilitation facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; because there is little experience regarding res@@ um@@ ption of the treatment after a leng@@ thy inter@@ ruption , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions must be cau@@ tious after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; 60 minutes before the start of inf@@ usion with drugs ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ agents ) , to minimize potential inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions . &quot;
&quot; in case of mild or moderate inf@@ usion , the treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of inf@@ usion rate to half of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , the inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
inf@@ usion may res@@ ume with a reduction of inf@@ usion rates on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ) as well as a reduction of inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
&quot; experimental studies do not lead to direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there are no data for new@@ bor@@ ns , which have been exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , is recommended to breast@@ feed with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me during treatment . &quot;
the side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
&quot; adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension with a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ wanted drug effects related to Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 @-@ study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with mostly severe comp@@ ut@@ ations and treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients it came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months of the treatment , whereby the patients aged under 5 years of age came to a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version ( average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to an early retirement from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were not present by radio@@ immun@@ oph@@ thal@@ mic ( RI@@ P ) ass@@ ay detected antibodies , among them 3 patients , with whom it had never been to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot;
patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was determined .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ ginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that seemed to imp@@ air the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies appeared not to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the appearance of undes@@ irable drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the ration@@ ale for enzyme replacement therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of the enzyme activity .
&quot; after intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lys@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited when they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received further 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in the lung function and the ability to determine which is shown in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me Group and 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically in@@ significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
&quot; from the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly prior to treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) ac@@ counted for a normal liver size by the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease in the G@@ AG mirror was established in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease incidence between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end point , the clinical significant changes group@@ ed for five eff@@ ectivity variable ( expected percentage normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walking test , range of motion of the shoulder joint , A@@ HI and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase 2 study was carried out in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with severe form of delay and 4 with the mean delay ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased g@@ ag@@ - mirror in the urine in week 22 . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) found a normal mental development speed according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group . &quot;
&quot; in a Phase 4 study , investigations on pharmac@@ ogen@@ ous effects of various Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me dosing regim@@ ens were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage regim@@ en with 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks may be a justi@@ fiable alternative for patients who have difficulty with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , it is not proven that the long term clinical efficacy of these two dosing regim@@ ens is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available , rate annually , and if required , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to those affected by older and less severely affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on security sp@@ ar ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data can not detect any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; as no toler@@ ances have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except those listed under 6 . &quot;

&quot; within the given time , the owner of the permit has to complete the following programme of study , whose results form the basis for the annual evaluation report on the benefit @-@ risk relationship . &quot;
this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information for patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ can@@ es ) , either in small amounts before or this enzyme is absent . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me or if you have a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction is any side effect occurring during inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion day ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; when using Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please tell your doctor if you are taking medications that contain Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
advice for handling - di@@ lu@@ tion and application The concentrate on the production of an inf@@ usion fluid must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intra@@ ven@@ ous use ( see information for doctors and medical personnel ) .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , respir@@ ation and ton@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; very common ( occurrence of more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • head@@ ache • nau@@ sea • skin r@@ ash • Joint diseases , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Incre@@ ased pulse • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • reaction to the inf@@ usion body &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available , rate annually , and if necessary , the prescription label will be updated . &quot;
&quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided the di@@ lu@@ tion was carried out under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me Inf@@ usion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Follow the body weight of each patient first to determine the number of di@@ lu@@ tion bottles to be dil@@ uted .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medicine against cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is probably easily spreading to other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used for patients who have previously not been treated , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies , as sole therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and foli@@ c acid ( vitamin B@@ 12 ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of cis@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( medicine against v@@ om@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a liquid deficiency ) should be given . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood @-@ picture changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be pushed upwards , or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells being shared .
&quot; the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug , and a longer duration in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ end@@ othel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin were average 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; in patients who previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ial cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta lasted longer periods of survival than with the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. to appro@@ ve the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 4,@@ 2 ml 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial cell car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial cell car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² of KO@@ F as inf@@ usion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - inf@@ usion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial car@@ cin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of KO@@ F is administered as intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , the day before and on the day of the tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed administration and on the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid was given . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout therapy duration and for further 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also need to receive intr@@ amus@@ cular injection vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) a week before the first P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving the tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , a complete blood picture should be created before each administration , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ an@@ in @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or SH@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times of the upper limit . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place under consideration of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood pattern or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the pre@@ - h@@ acking therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applied for ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 blood .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity ≥ C 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted by the patient the value before treatment &quot;
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 doses of dose a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or more in comparison to patients aged 65 years an elevated side @-@ effects risk exists .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age because of insufficient data to harm@@ fulness and efficacy .
&quot; in clinical trials , dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data layer in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - threshold and / or trans@@ am@@ inas@@ en@@ values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit ( for liver metast@@ asis ) or &gt; 5,0 @-@ fold the upper limit ( if liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients need to be monitored with regard to bone treatment , and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed should not be administered to patients before their absolute neutral number of neut@@ rop@@ hi@@ es once again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neutral density , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count and maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of the grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was examined if a pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed need to be used to apply foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure for reducing treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to moderate kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ rology ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ ls@@ acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , intended for therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients with which these events occurred were appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion before the tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment is to be considered . &quot;
&quot; 5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed occasionally when this ingredient was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ versible damage of the reproductive capacity by P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed consists , males ought to be advised in front of the treatment guard to obtain advice regarding the conservation of sperm . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ rology ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can result in a reduced breakdown of side effects . &quot;
caution is advised when used in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data is available with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long semi @-@ value such as pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - x@@ ed . &quot;
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , serious birth defects are expected during pregnancy . &quot;
tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed may not be used during pregnancy unless it is essential and after careful consideration of the benefit of the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ versible les@@ ion of reproductive capacity is made by P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment , advice regarding the sper@@ ma contrac@@ tion . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed passes into the breast milk and undes@@ irable effects in the breast@@ feeding inf@@ ant cannot be ruled out .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects , reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , and the random@@ ised cis@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , and 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , random@@ ised cis@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;

ALI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti @-@ fol@@ ate that exercises its effect by inter@@ rup@@ ting important metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .

the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients receiving treatment arms ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma was demonstrated in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the common cis@@ pl@@ a tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms arm were improved by improving the lung function parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a di@@ sill@@ usion of the lung function over time in the controller .
&quot; a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with ALI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy followed a medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months with ALI@@ M@@ TA treated patients ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 283 ) and from 7.9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival fell in favor of ALI@@ M@@ TA in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epithel@@ ial hist@@ ological type ( n = 399 , 9,@@ 3 versus 8.0 months , adapted HR = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;

the effectiveness analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ sub@@ ordination of ALI@@ M@@ TA cis@@ pl@@ atin combination versus gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine cis@@ pl@@ atin combination .
&quot; average P@@ FS was 4.8 months for the combination ALI@@ M@@ TA cis@@ pl@@ atin against 5.1 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine cis@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1,@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 30.@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 25,@@ 0 - 31.@@ 4 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;

the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed after administration as a mon@@ otherap@@ ic were studied in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tum@@ ours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in inf@@ usion areas over a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose will be found unchanged within 24 hours of the application in the urine .
tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and half @-@ life time in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the col@@ oring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish without compromising the quality of the specimen .
&quot; it is used for over@@ weight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they can not dis@@ assemble some fats in the food , causing a quarter of the fats fed with food in@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
in a third trial All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in the two studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s on after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with fa@@ eces , stu@@ ff@@ ing , o@@ ily / o@@ ily fa@@ eces ( rot ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( preventing organ rejection in tran@@ spl@@ ant patients ) or medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; it may not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( not enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Limited approval for the placing of or@@ list@@ at G@@ SK in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; All@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) , and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ine , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; however , as or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ bed , the dosage is not necessary in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Chr@@ onic Mal@@ absorption syndrome • Ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.8 )
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of occurrence of g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a low @-@ fat single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
&quot; as weight reduction can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist prior to treatment with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diab@@ etic should be adapted if necessary . &quot;
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage needs to be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to take additional prev@@ ent@@ ative measures , in order to prevent the oral contrac@@ eption possible in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases , with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma bar was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international norm@@ alised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials were the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the administration of a dispos@@ able dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a limited number of healthy volunteers , who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , observed a slight decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and depend on the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented . &quot;
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg for a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not in@@ valuable ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of adverse events detected after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncle@@ ar magnitude . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to inhi@@ bitions in terms of possible and actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
the majority of cases reported after the market launch were reported either side effects or similar side effects as reported in the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals can be prec@@ eded by a rapid reco@@ il of any systemic effects attribut@@ able to the colli@@ ding properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect pres@@ upp@@ oses in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bond to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of ga@@ str@@ i and p@@ ank@@ re@@ ous eyel@@ ids .
&quot; from clinical trials , it was derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at was taken three times a day , the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 document the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was used three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , low @-@ fat diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the output value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as part of the study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the largest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in Gesamt@@ cholester@@ in was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of the L@@ DL Cholester@@ ins was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3,30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( output 3.4 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
during waist measurement the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at was 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( base value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , not metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of accumulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study of obes@@ e patients , given the minim@@ ally systemic absorb@@ able dose , two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ ton@@ ing ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ form @-@ leu@@ cine @-@ group ) , could be identified , which presented approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety @-@ related mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ous potential and reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity , pre@@ clinical data cannot identify any particular danger to humans . &quot;

the most common side effects depend on the effect of the capsules together and develop thereby that fat is eliminated from the body .
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , since at this time the fat percentage in the diet might not have been reduced consistently . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize nutritional benefits : • Beg@@ ins already several days , or better a week , before the first intake of capsules with a fatty food . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the probability that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fat evenly on daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a rich dessert , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction . &quot;

&quot; a permanent weight loss , for example by improving the diet and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive effect on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and learn to nour@@ ish yourself permanently . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ oj@@ ou@@ les , which you also find as indication of the packaging of food . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot;
the recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
&quot; what quantity is suitable for you can be found in the information below which indicates the number of calories , which is suitable for you . • Because of the effect of the capsule , compliance with recommended fat intake is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by keeping the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss and at the same time dimin@@ ish the lik@@ el@@ ihood of nutritional benefits . • You should try to decrease step @-@ by @-@ step and continuously . &quot;
34 These reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually lose about 0.5 kg per week in weight without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . &quot;
• For a permanent weight loss it is necessary to put yourself realistic cal@@ ory and fat targets and adhere to them as well . • Sinn@@ ful is a dietary diary with information on cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ orie and fatty acids and give guidelines to become more physically active .

&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are even trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( like cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ( a medicine used as an anti@@ em@@ etic agent ) .
&quot; the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as the effects in this age group do not have enough information . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active substance compounds the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adult , which received chem@@ otherap@@ ies which are strong or even trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no v@@ om@@ iting ( 132 of 223 ) compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no v@@ om@@ iting ( 153 of 189 ) compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted a approval to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the transport of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is indicated , for prevention of acute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in severe surgery due to cancer diagnosis and prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids given before chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on massage , patients should be closely monitored with an@@ am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advised when using Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval , or in patients where the Q@@ t interval is prolonged or that tend to such an extension . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with a further chemotherapy medication , Alo@@ xi should not be used for prevention or treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit tumor activity in pre@@ clinical trials ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous administration of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( am@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , c@@ im@@ eti@@ b , ch@@ ini@@ dine , ch@@ ini@@ dine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience in the application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human gest@@ ures is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the most common adverse events were observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least probably associated with Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the meeting place ( fir@@ ing , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences . &quot;
the group with the highest dosage showed similar frequency of adverse events as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose reactions .
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy with a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double blind@@ ness studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients received an appropriate chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cis@@ pl@@ atin , car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1.500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 250 micro@@ grams or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , received on Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intra@@ ven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , received intra@@ ven@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ o@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters were comparable to the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study conducted in 221 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of I.@@ V. in single doses of 0,25 , 0.75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After intra@@ ven@@ ous gift is followed by an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ value of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the concentrations @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 - ∞ ) are generally proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in patients and cancer patients .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses the mean ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
&quot; from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , at once daily intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0,25 m@@ g. Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached 3 consecutive days , total exposition ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable to the intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg measured ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the gran@@ ting of 0.75 mg . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor .
&quot; in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser degree , the I@@ so@@ y@@ enzymes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
elimination Up to an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine . Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ changeable ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
&quot; after a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous injection of patients , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although patients with severe liver function distur@@ b the terminal removal time and the average systemic exposure with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human@@ ist exposure , suggest@@ ing a slight relevance for clinical use . &quot;
10 from pre@@ clinical trials suggest that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only very high concentrations of ion channels which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of action .
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to approximately 30 times of therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily for over two years led to an increased incidence of liver tum@@ ors , end@@ oc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( thy@@ roid gland , p@@ ank@@ re@@ as , adren@@ al mark ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is used for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is assessed as low for humans . &quot;
the controller of this approval for the placing on the market must inform the European Commission about the plans for placing the drug approved within the framework of this decision .

June 2006 the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the prescription of the drug approved for the treatment of hepatitis C is recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million ie / ml injection solution .
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon would resem@@ ble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by virus infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ opic investigation the liver tissue has damage , in addition the values of the liver enzyme Al@@ an@@ in- Amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood ab@@ normal . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates it to create the active substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon submitted data showing the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the medicine , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of reference doctor to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
the study was measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting the treatment to the medicine ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int http : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non business purposes only provided only provided by the CH@@ MP .
&quot; in addition , concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug can not be sufficient . &quot;
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
&quot; after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease improved again in more patients than with the reference doctor ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study to examine the question , to what extent the medication forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , is not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( cra@@ cks or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go is not supposed to be used to treat infections , which have been proven or presum@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go might not work against these kinds of infections . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients at the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years the skin surface should not exceed 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of effectiveness was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under plac@@ ebo spoke to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together on skin dogs , approximately 90 % of patients of both groups responded to treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( filtered cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effects associated with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the order .
&quot; the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the following super@@ ficial skin infections in comparison with the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected little la@@ in@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; may 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o Group Ltd. to appro@@ ve the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of sensi@@ ti@@ sing or serious local irrit@@ ation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection will commen@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections , where MR@@ SA is known or suspected as path@@ ogens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in secondary open wounds , efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient . &quot;
alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected area after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations , which have been reached in humans according to top@@ ical application on the skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After con@@ current oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased by 81 % off the skin of healthy adult men by 81 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dose adjustments are not considered necessary when top@@ ical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive @-@ toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate with regard to a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
&quot; ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy , when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to use a systemic antibiotic . &quot;
&quot; when deciding whether breast@@ feeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated , between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the alt@@ ar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , which have applied Al@@ tar@@ go , the most common reported side effect irrit@@ ation at the administration place , which looked about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode Eff@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance isolated by fermentation made of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ ag@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ ag@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the effective mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding point of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the binding point of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer ase@@ center .
&quot; through binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should , due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least may seem question@@ able at least some infection forms , should seek advice by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the in vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in case of non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; res@@ or@@ ption In a study involving healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was released daily under oc@@ clusi@@ on on intact and ton@@ ed skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice a day for the top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected traum@@ atic wounds , single plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
sampling took place on days 3 or 4 of adult patients in front of the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic intake of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 s@@ lan@@ ted skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 n@@ g · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
&quot; metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with limited participation of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity on rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro investigation on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in the rats @-@ micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo studies chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats any signs of reduced fertility at oral dosage of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby an up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 s@@ me@@ ed skin : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats , in oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development ox@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity have been established . &quot;

&quot; ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix is used as part of one of two doses of existing vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be achieved only after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan can be put to an end from two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is desired for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , &quot; as it can defend against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the V@@ acc@@ ine Twin V@@ acc@@ ine admitted since 1996 , and the V@@ acc@@ ine Twin V@@ acc@@ ine admitted since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan of three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence of the use of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator for the effectiveness was the percentage of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study of 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month interval between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix led a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody levels against hepatitis A and B. &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar in a six@@ - and a 12 @-@ month interval between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , mat@@ iness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is not allowed to apply hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the placing of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
&quot; the standardis@@ ation plan for the basic di@@ mm@@ ing with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if vacc@@ ination is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated using the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine . &quot;
the anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are based on the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured , whether immun@@ ologically competent persons who have responded to hepatitis A vacc@@ ination , need vacc@@ ination as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the administration of the vaccine appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately .
&quot; if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine , which contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; after pri@@ ming patients with hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there is no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines can be required . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intr@@ amus@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact in the glut@@ eal muscles , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ ot@@ hr@@ ine distur@@ ban@@ ces , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected as an exception , as in these cases it can be intr@@ amus@@ cular to bleeding . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life as a separate injection with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that no adequate immune response is possible . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , red@@ ness , swelling , dex@@ ter@@ ity , g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in former Thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation . &quot;
in clinical trials 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ination doses were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and dex@@ ter@@ ity on a basis basis per vacc@@ ination dose , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.7 % of subjects compared to 39.@@ 1 % in subjects following the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
&quot; after the complete vaccine cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects had given the Ambi@@ rix were about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in subjects , which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the incidence of mat@@ iness was comparable to the whole vaccine cycle ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of subjects who received Ambi@@ rix , compared to 36.@@ 2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the incidence of pronounced pain and dex@@ ter@@ ity was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination regim@@ en .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , the appearance of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that observed when using the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per sample , was reported . &quot;
&quot; the proportion of vacc@@ inations , reported by severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine , with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ I@@ SA@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B virus , was not statisti@@ cally different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials conducted for vacc@@ ination at the age of 1 to 15 , the dose conversion rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the dose rate rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. , month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to 15 @-@ year olds , 142 two cans of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; with 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination was higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which in a clinical comparative study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after the completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; for individuals who were aged between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
&quot; in a clinical trial at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme to which in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was given at the same time with the chim@@ ing of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and servo conversion rates as for the previous formulation .

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food@@ stuff and drinks , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as through bathing in waters contaminated by waste water . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow @-@ looking ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot completely protect from infection with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus even though the complete vacc@@ ination series has been concluded with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child infected before the administration of both V@@ acc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix already infected with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick / feels ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections that affect the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis A or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated . &quot;
• If you / your child have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
&quot; allergic reaction can manifest through it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , breathing or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever . &quot;
&quot; • If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and prior to the scheduled date of the second vaccine ) . &quot;
&quot; at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , he / your child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis A / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of an active hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
the second vaccine dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you a vacc@@ ination protection against the end of the vaccine .
&quot; sometimes , if you / your child are weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense , or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons on vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child receives further medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated recently / or if you have given vacc@@ ination or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibody ) or that is planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or breast@@ feeding women is not administered unless it is urgent that they can be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) with you / your child .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and make a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
♦ A very common ( more than 1 case per 10 ch@@ imp@@ li@@ fied doses ) : • Pain or dis@@ comfort at the insertion site or red@@ ness • Mat@@ ernity • irrit@@ ability • head@@ ache • lack of appetite
♦ frequent ( up to 1 case per 10 p@@ enn@@ ed doses ) : • Sw@@ elling at the injection point • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • di@@ zz@@ iness • g@@ astro@@ intestinal complaints
&quot; other side effects reported , the days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or individual vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 pregnant cans ) are reported : &quot;
&quot; these include limited or extensive r@@ ashes which can be it@@ chy or bli@@ stering , swelling of the eyes and face , terri@@ fying breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and un@@ consciousness . &quot;

23 Inform@@ ate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects you / your child significantly imp@@ airs or you notice side effects that are not stated in this prescription label .
ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data that has been known for placing the first permit for the market , CH@@ MP has assumed that the benefit @-@ risk relationship for Ambi@@ rix stays positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix was only launched in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
Ammon@@ ite may also be used in patients at the age of over a month with a complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium mic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain damage caused by high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; Ammon@@ ite is administered - split into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or administered via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ y hose ( through the stomach into the stomach of leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , as ammon@@ ites could not be compared with a different treatment or plac@@ ebo ( i.e. without substance ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ite may also cause loss of appetite , a ab@@ normal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , stomach pain , v@@ om@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , uncomfortable body od@@ or , or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ites in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; ammon@@ ite was approved under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; because only limited information about this medicine was due to the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of approval . &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme deficiency is already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first months of life ) , there is an indication for use when an@@ am@@ n@@ ese consists of hyper@@ ammon@@ ium enc@@ ephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with hi@@ cc@@ ups , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient for the growth and development .
&quot; according to clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium but@@ yr@@ ate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of meth@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ker@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.6 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as a risk for the emergence of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a exists if the tablets are not immediately absorbed into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each Tabl@@ ette AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium chlori@@ de , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and dem@@ ni@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion are carried out by the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be applied only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in a sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate on young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and a increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
it also found a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during lac@@ tation ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS at 56 % of patients at least an unwanted event ( AE ) and 78 % of these undes@@ irable events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ or@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in combination with Lak@@ Tat@@ azi@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ag@@ ony top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of an over@@ dose occurred during a 5 month old to@@ d@@ dler with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms start with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity during an intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound which acts through acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kid@@ neys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with ure@@ a is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram it can be produced sodium but@@ yl but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that diagnosis is early and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
&quot; the pro@@ g@@ nosis of early manifest form of the disease with occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ eri@@ zed , and the disease itself led to death itself in the treatment of per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ a within the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; through hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilisation of alternative path@@ ways of the nitrogen secre@@ tion ( sodium but@@ yr@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post @-@ part@@ al ( however within the first life @-@ month ) to increase the incidence of 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were previously treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ium enc@@ ephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with many to mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ us trans@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by hyper@@ ammon@@ ia em@@ ephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium but@@ yr@@ at and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly re@@ versible even in the treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition may occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ co@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is served in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were obtained after the administration of a single dose of 5 g. of sodium but@@ yr@@ at in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites were also studied in cancer patients following intra@@ ven@@ ous use of sodium but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral individual dose of 5 g sodium but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; in the majority of patients with ure@@ a cy@@ cl@@ usal or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma can be detected . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis cir@@ rho@@ sis treated with sodium but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted from the kid@@ neys within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ g@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium but@@ yr@@ ate treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses had no cl@@ onal effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at is either taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children , who are not able to swal@@ low tablets , or patients with hi@@ cc@@ ups ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ y hose or a Nas@@ al probe . &quot;
&quot; according to clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium but@@ yr@@ ate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and for adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of meth@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ker@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ul@@ at contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium but@@ yr@@ ate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium chlori@@ de , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ) , les@@ ions were found in the pyram@@ idal cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ or@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in combination with Lak@@ Tat@@ azi@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ag@@ ony top@@ enia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with ure@@ a is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
&quot; on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that for each gram it can be produced sodium but@@ yl but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly re@@ versible in the treatment , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition may occur . &quot;
after an oral individual dose of 5 g sodium but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ulate form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can save the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure contains the small measuring spo@@ on 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spo@@ on 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8.6 g sodium yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium but@@ yr@@ ate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they can not ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after eating proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS , since sodium yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; when taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines , please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MONA@@ PS , as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , taste disorders , after@@ math of hearing , dis@@ orient@@ edness , memory disorders and deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or with the emergency room of your hospital to initiate a corresponding treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you forget the intake of AM@@ MONA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; changes in the blood picture ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , sickness , v@@ om@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , uncomfortable skin od@@ or , skin r@@ ash , kidney function , weight gain and an@@ om@@ al lab results . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly imp@@ aired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use @-@ information .
you may not use AM@@ MONA@@ PS after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date on the box and the container after &quot; Use until the specified exp@@ ir@@ ation date . &quot;
&quot; like AM@@ MONA@@ PS , and contents of the pack of AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets are of white color and oval shape , and they are equipped with the embos@@ sing &quot; &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS , since sodium yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; when taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines , please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; you should take AM@@ MONA@@ PS evenly over the same individual doses or use a gast@@ ric fi@@ st@@ ula ( hose , which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose , which is guided through the nose into the stomach ) . &quot;
&quot; 31 • Rem@@ ove from the recept@@ acle a he@@ aped spo@@ on gran@@ ulate . • Pu@@ t a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the top edge of the knife to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • Rem@@ ove the recommended number of spo@@ ons gran@@ ules from the container . &quot;
&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox is applied to the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in inst@@ able ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stroke &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measuring value at electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if an@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients receiving a PCI , a higher dose is administered and inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of an@@ gi@@ ox was compared with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , the patient often became a st@@ ent ( a short tube which remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , an@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a G@@ PI administration - was just as effective as conventional treatment after 30 days or a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients who undergo a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for heavy bleeding , where it was much more effective than He@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic to bi@@ val@@ er@@ udi@@ n , other mil@@ ep@@ ud@@ ine or any of the other components ) . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or cardiac infection . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during one PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve angi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ elevation in@@ far@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in case of emergency stop or when an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intra@@ ven@@ ous infection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if one PCI is performed in another episode , an additional bol@@ us should be given from 0.5 mg / kg and the inf@@ usion is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0,25 m@@ g. / kg / h can be res@@ um@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a cle@@ vis of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous cle@@ vis of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of an an@@ gi@@ ox @-@ specific Bol@@ us administration has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI enc@@ ro@@ achment is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shor@@ tened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re @-@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and the bol@@ us dose should be administered intra@@ ven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney impair@@ ment ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ radi@@ n against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is under 225 seconds , a second bol@@ us dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bol@@ us dosage is again checked again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT was 5 minutes after the administration of the Bi@@ val@@ er@@ udi@@ n @-@ Bol@@ us with an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after termination of the intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of frac@@ tional pi@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .

&quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ radi@@ n is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if in the case of PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n , most bleeding at arter@@ ial points can occur , in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , during treatment in principle bleeding occurs everywhere . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ radi@@ n , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) should be taken into account in order to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ radi@@ n is reg@@ ained prior to treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tica or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , these agents can increase the risk of blood . &quot;
&quot; in combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ radi@@ n with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ bers or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ og@@ g parameters are regularly monitored . &quot;
&quot; the experimental studies are inadequate regarding the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , band@@ aging or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;

&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n group as well as in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years more frequently came to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding has been defined according to the A@@ cu@@ ity and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding as in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
&quot; an A@@ cu@@ ity heavy bleeding has been defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point of point , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood station , re@@ operation due to a bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;

the following data on side effects are based on the data of a clinical trial with Bi@@ val@@ er@@ udi@@ n in 6000 patients under@@ going a PCI .
&quot; in both the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women as well as patients over 65 years more frequently came to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;

&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported in practice after a comprehensive application and are group@@ ed according to system sub @-@ classes in Table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in the case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ radi@@ n is immediately to be canc@@ eled and the patient closely monitor with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox includes Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ band@@ ry inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center and the anim@@ e @-@ ind@@ entation region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine is bound in the liquid phase or on t@@ inn@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; binding Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is re@@ versible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is slowly spl@@ itting the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n @-@ AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n with ser@@ um of patients who had come to he@@ par@@ in@@ induc@@ ing th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induc@@ ing th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) was not indu@@ ce a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregate reaction . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent an@@ tic@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is occupied by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was carried out in the following patients , an additional bol@@ us should be given by 0.@@ 5mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n and the inf@@ usion is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
in arm A of the A@@ cu@@ ity study un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with inst@@ able ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift in@@ far@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either prior to angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or at the PCI .
&quot; in the A@@ cu@@ ity study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were spread evenly over the 3 treatment arms . &quot;
&quot; approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ ring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ar@@ kers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients were subjected to angi@@ ography within 72 hours . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes , which need treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm inj@@ ected or as permanent inf@@ usion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin is not able to work effectively .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin differs very slightly from human insulin and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ effective human insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type 2 diabetes where insulin is unable to work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator for effectiveness was to change the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study with adult type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.9 % ) was determined in comparison with a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin levels . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0,30 % with human standard insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin lu@@ li@@ sin or any of the other components , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines , which can affect blood glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the marketing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the delta muscle , or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous inf@@ usion in the area of the abdominal wall . &quot;
&quot; due to the decreased glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced insulin delivery , insulin requirement can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function . &quot;
&quot; the type of insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , zin@@ k@@ delay , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or manufacturing method can change the insulin requirement . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of a treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict physician supervision and can make a change in dosage required .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin @-@ used insulin and can therefore change when changing the treatment regim@@ en .
&quot; the substances that can increase blood glucose levels and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias include oral anti@@ diab@@ e@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ optic pyramid , fluor@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ etic agents such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and ti@@ pin the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation can be weak@@ ened or absent . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive st@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity showed no difference between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin lu@@ li@@ sin occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ ted after oral use . &quot;
&quot; the following are listed from clinical trials known un@@ solic@@ ited medicines , group@@ ed by system sub @-@ classes and sorted by decreasing incidence of their occurrence ( very often : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data is not in@@ valuable ) . &quot;

&quot; li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Will be missed to continuously change the injection unit within the injection area , can result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection point . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) that are given by an appropri@@ ately trained person or by a doctor through intra@@ ven@@ ous gift of glucose .
&quot; after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the cause for severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
&quot; insulin sin@@ ks blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake ( especially by skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) , as well as by in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver . &quot;
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that the insulin lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin occurs faster and the duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus , insulin lu@@ li@@ sin showed a proportional amount of glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and 0.3 E / kg or more a di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate increase in glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin has twice as fast as normal human insulin and achieves a total glu@@ cos@@ es@@ ive effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; from the data it was clear that in an application of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable postoperative gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with a human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin lu@@ li@@ sin was taken 2 minutes before meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ ial control was achieved than with a human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin lu@@ li@@ sin is directed 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control as with a human standard insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ ds before meal ( see Figure 1 ) , is achieved . &quot;
&quot; insulin lu@@ li@@ sin by offering 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the meal commen@@ ced before the meal commen@@ ced ( Figure 1A ) , and compared to the human standard insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin lu@@ li@@ sin at gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal , compared to human Nor@@ - mal@@ ine , which was 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) . &quot;
