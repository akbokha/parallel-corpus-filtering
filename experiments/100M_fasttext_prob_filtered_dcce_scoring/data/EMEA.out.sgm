<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"multipolar thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar I disturbance, a mental disorder where patients have manic episodes (periods of anormal high mood) alternately with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes associated with the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased unrest or behavioural disturbances when oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be applied to intake or the enamel tablets in patients receiving the swallowing of tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"for patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells among each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is probably mainly used as a "partial agonist" for receptors for neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole acts as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less dimensions than the neurotransmitter to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify, to prevent recurrence of symptoms, was examined in three studies by up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered an increased unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms have already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify Injection Solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased unrest with which Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo were compared over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was examined by a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body resorbed the enamel tablets and the solution to intake (decreases).</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution showed patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased unrest than the patients receiving a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">"moreover, Abilify impeded up to 74 weeks more effectively than placebo the re-occurrence of manic episodes in previously untreated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled), hiberty (drowsiness), disstipation (drowsiness), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee on Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder, as well as in preventing a new manic episode in patients who have predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes addressed the treatment with Aripiprazole, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"furthermore, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in quick control of increased unrest and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder, if oral therapy is not appropriate, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the transport of Abilify throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is for treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of Bipolar-I- disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes related to treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dosage should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 Induction is removed from combination therapy, the recommended dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorder and was reported in some cases following the beginning or after change of an anti-psychotic therapy and also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, failure disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions prescribed for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolasis, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including aczelerated and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials that lasted a year or less there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the patient treated with Abilify symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinesia, should be taken into consideration, reduce the dose or break down the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"when a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a minor, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of Mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at states associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of dying in comparison with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted cerebrovascular events with Aripiprazole treated patients."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma, or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical anti-psychotic agents, including Abilify."</seg>

<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania because of comorbidities, the application of antipsychotics, where weight gain is known as side effects, or an unhealthy lifestyle, and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary action of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with superimposed side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical trial with healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazl by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and that is why similar can reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"with CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor "), the joint application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism."</seg>
<seg id="53">"considering the common administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made."</seg>

<seg id="57">"in clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazl per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethylan / 3-methoxymorphinan-ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethylan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the lack of data for safety in humans and due to the concerns developed in reproductive studies, this medicine may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for fetus."</seg>

<seg id="73">"although there is no information about the efficacy of hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose, as Aripiprazole has a high plasma termination."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is believed that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole is mediated in schizophrenia and bipolar I disturbance on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HTGF receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"in vitro, Aripiprazole showed high affinity for Dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor as well as an even affinity to dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and for histamine H1reception."</seg>

<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible doses above 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar-I, Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar-I-disorder Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and actively controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a Bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a conservation effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>

<seg id="2671">"after setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease improved again in more patients than with the reference doctor; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test used in the study to examine the question, to what extent the medication forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), is not sufficiently validated."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used for the treatment of impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected Lazerations (cracks or cuts), abrasions and sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">"Altargo is not supposed to be used to treat infections, which have been proven or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo might not work against these kinds of infections."</seg>

<seg id="2699">The effective mechanism of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding point of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosom that differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the binding point of ribosomal protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransfer asecenter.</seg>

<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm injected or as permanent infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or the insulin is not able to work effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration than a short-effective human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-term insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in type 2 diabetes where insulin is unable to work effectively, Apidra has been studied in a study with 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for effectiveness was to change the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study with adult type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.9%) was determined in comparison with a reduction of 0.14% in insulin levels."</seg>
