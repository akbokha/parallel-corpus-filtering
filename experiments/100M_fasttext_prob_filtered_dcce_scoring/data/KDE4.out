&quot; if part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated to the location of the entire page . &quot;
&quot; machine translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . in the best case , Bab@@ el@@ fish produces a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , no important decisions should be made dependent on translations without checking the translation . &quot;
only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated onto the Bab@@ el@@ fish page where you can insert translated texts directly .
package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size they provide some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making these easier available .
further information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings Exten@@ sions .... open the tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard setup modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons package . please note that if you have additional software installed on your system .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on extras crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if available , delete . &quot;
the module view filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Tools Plac@@ ement Fil@@ ters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the root node of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ Elements , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
each object is represented by a rec@@ t@@ angle whose area is proportional to its size . each object is represented by a rec@@ t@@ angle whose area is proportional to its size . this size must own the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file or folder represents the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . in this way , large files , even if they are located far below in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the tre@@ ad representation is a rec@@ t@@ angle representing a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation use the rectang@@ les of meaningful color and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rec@@ t@@ angle , which is switched by view color mode , can be either depth for the light detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the illustration of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rec@@ t@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature , you can specify if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rectang@@ les should be used ( and therefore , you can specify the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rec@@ t@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; when performing algorithms for st@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . this purpose is not always observed . &quot;
&quot; like division of the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries , the implementation is left to the implementation . here it is necessary for the let@@ tering and to avoid space losses through frames to create rectang@@ les that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive branch . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minim@@ ally displayed area for an entry through the menu entry View . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; used as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for the K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ass application .
you can find the picture gallery in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Tools Picture gallery ... or by Ctr@@ l ; I .
&quot; when you access the picture gallery , a dialog opens , where you can set the layout of the gallery . &quot;
the title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option images per line has a slider and a script to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
&quot; with the File Name check box , you can specify whether the fil@@ ename can be displayed among the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the file size check box , you can specify whether the file size is displayed among the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the image size check box , you can determine whether the size of the images is shown below the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog folder , you specify where the gallery will be stored and which sub @-@ folders should be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file selection Save to HTML file , specify where the HTML page should be saved . &quot;
&quot; with the sub @-@ folder check box , you can set a slider or a script to which level the sub @-@ folders can be included . &quot;
copy the original images to the gallery and copy whether the original images should be copied to the gallery .
with the comments file check box you can specify a comment file for the inscription of the images in the gallery .
&quot; in the check box Custom color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings offers easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras html settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to help you connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ . more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work together . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; contains a fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to comment , comment , and correct your photos . the processing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional features . it works fully in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DNG export and ICC color management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as eg ; via the camera or the lens that can be sought . &quot;
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore you should report problems and improvement possibilities .
&quot; whenever you are in the program , the Help menu will open a page in the error reporting system . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu will open a page in the error reporting system . if you use these short@@ cuts , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developer help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to ask you about other users of &amp; digi@@ pack ; however , you may ask for questions about other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should be so powerful in this language . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ ti@@ zer homepage to learn news about shared releases and other information about and digi@@ ti@@ sed ; to learn .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ate ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for announc@@ ing in the developer mailing list from &amp; digi@@ came ; .
&quot; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the dat@@ ab@@ n@@ k will be stored . this path will remain the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam , you will additionally use as an old library . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder containing images , as a base folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; thir@@ sts recur@@ sively the library path throughout its depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders , unless it is i@@ ste in hidden folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list do not take pictures as symbols . you can change them by using any photo from the album and use it on the folder icon . this will then be used as an album symbol . further details can be found in the section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . afterwards , you should learn how to use My Albums and My Key@@ words to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported Roh@@ kam@@ eras in the Help Menu Help menu . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Sec@@ tions Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h Workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to help you connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ . more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work together . &quot;
modern digital cameras feature the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera is then used as a disk drive . the camera is then used as a disk drive . the camera can also be used via Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives . older cameras may be used to connect serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; digital cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association . it also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transm@@ issions over the serial port are slow , this connection is outdated . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to read the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ K@@ am reliably . if the Exif support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , and digi@@ ti@@ sed ; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; themselves perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , either side bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or Ctr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag@@ ging and dro@@ pping pictures works everywhere : you can take a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ma , above the horizontal dividing line or in another application window . the only restriction is that one image cannot be placed in keywords , data list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , the filtering on the fil@@ ename is displayed only if this ind is displayed on the symbol view . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings . &quot;
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ st@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by and digi@@ ti@@ sed are stored in a single album room . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were recorded on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ Properties or after the date the album was created first . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop it there . in the pop @-@ up menu you can select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . you can also move or copy several photos in the same way . simply select all photos and move it to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select Edit properties in the pop @-@ up menu . &quot;
&quot; alb@@ um@@ - Coll@@ ections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the Settings for Coll@@ ections . &quot;
the album Date : will be used when you sort your albums by date with view albums By date .
&quot; the buttons El@@ dest , average , New Year : these set the date on that of the oldest , the latest picture or the average of the album . this will first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file in this folder will be used instead . &quot;
&quot; when you first get an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album is chosen as a symbol for &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ st@@ quot ; this is meant to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you will need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select &quot; &quot; Album &quot; &quot; in the context menu &amp; quot ; Select . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
the collection includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window gives you the main preview of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album are displayed in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can customize the size of this preview with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait briefly while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid using all preview images in the Tools menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image is displayed below the appropriate preview . what information is this , you can set about settings digi@@ ti@@ sed ; set up the albums page and adjust the area thumb@@ nails to your desires . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . the help displays the most important features including all tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the section introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
&quot; photos are all about which it was &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the pictures and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image editing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these . you can choose between the view of the images , a slideshow or the editing of the pictures . &quot;
you can open the image editing with a photo by pressing either F@@ 4 image editing ... or the right mouse button context menu . editing image editing is a guide on how to edit your photos and edit them .
&quot; it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by using the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub @-@ menu of the file type . to do this , and how to adjust it to your needs if your program is not en@@ um@@ er@@ ated , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after processing other image editing programs can come to problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not save this data when you save the modified image . this way , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture etc . &quot;
&quot; the simpl@@ est one is to click on the thumb@@ nail to preview and rotate . in the sub @-@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the fil@@ ename of a photo , you can click the Pre@@ view and select F2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete a photo and delete it , it is moved to the tr@@ ash bin by &amp; k@@ de ; move . F@@ 8 picture Del@@ ete or Del if you prefer to delete it , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; My data sli@@ st@@ quot ; organize your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date , or if it is not available , the date of last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown . &quot;
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos . keywords are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups .
&quot; if a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . hereby you can log@@ ically organize your keywords . you can also keep parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word@@ list , so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My head@@ word quot ; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this keyword will become the sub @-@ keyword of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and choose Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a keyword by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and put it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . a keyword may be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords .
&quot; to select a different photo as an album icon , you will need to click the picture with the right mouse button and choose as album preview in the pop @-@ up menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : as soon as you select the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My sample keyword . alternatively , you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My sample keyword . alternatively , you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My sample keyword . alternatively , you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords . alternatively , you can also click on the images to preview the pictures and choose from the context menu keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can specify a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can specify a keyword for each person in a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will be shown under the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
you can remove a keyword in which you can open the right mouse button context menu of the photo and select Rem@@ ove from the Tags menu . the menu will show you only the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
&quot; the time beam view shows a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be shifted via this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only need to click on the lower rec@@ t@@ angle of the selection box , which indicates the time unit . this displays all associated images in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it will then appear in the list below .
&quot; all elements of the database include names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , dat@@ est@@ amps and more . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all pictures will be displayed again . if the search has not found , then the lamp will be red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this , you will find a simple search box as described above . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search is done . the results are displayed in the My search list in the main window . the text field S@@ ali@@ vary search is used to make your request a name in My search list , and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you select to edit a search , the form to enter the search returns with the previously entered search information . if you select as an advanced search , the dialog for advanced search appears to change your previous search . here are more rules for the search . for more information , see the Advanced search tool . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the contex@@ tual menu . &quot;
the Advanced search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the album database . an option can be added to this list using the search group / search group . an option can be added with others about the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; &quot;
&quot; the less the difference between two sig@@ natures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar Entries : this is an area where you can let each picture fall in order to find a similar . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ ert , the result selection can be enlarged or res@@ ized . if you slide a picture from somewhere about the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side bar , it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sk@@ etch : hand @-@ hand color sk@@ etch : draw a quick sk@@ etch and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; find the matching images . also here can be set a threshold .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . you can move in or out or hold it on the left mouse wheel . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course this requires your pictures Ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder .
&quot; she works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
&quot; select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctr@@ l ; L D@@ em Ligh@@ tly Ad@@ ded from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and open its window . if you are back in the digi@@ ti@@ zed main window , you can open the lumin@@ aire quickly with L Tools Ligh@@ tly . &quot;
&quot; from the preview pane , you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window and place there . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you are using pairs from the toolbar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for the same . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to display it in the right pane . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , normal sol@@ dering actions also work directly from the lumin@@ aire like e.g. F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in pi@@ v@@ ot function , which you can see at the crossed arrows . to preview the visible area of the image , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both pictures will display the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . just use the zoom control under the images or Ctr@@ l ; scroll wheel to zoom in the image and zoom in . this happens in both images if you are in the Pre@@ view mode .
&quot; what is a digital inventory management - apart from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process followed after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , sc@@ ans or saves digital photos performs a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images , protect , file , group@@ ing , backup , review , comp@@ ute , archive , optimize , maintain , and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital Invent@@ ory Administration takes on , index@@ ed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , transforms , conf@@ ec@@ tioned , and exports content that have a monetary or cultural value . &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is defined in accordance with your definition data which provide information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t need to save a specific photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t want to know how many photos you have , then you certainly don &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach to save metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving on which you can freely use other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide if you want to have other access to your photos , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point . &quot;
&quot; maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you have enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use . export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements , such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work sequences , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % Archive and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or an derived picture .
&quot; we also recommend the option to save metadata in the configuration page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget that , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what you want to change ? add a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . of course these are the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , as you are often called by other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ised images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; automatically mount the tree for you res@@ ize the images to the right place . the change of the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by drag@@ ging a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are handled by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated as it tracks down the sub@@ trees . &quot;
&quot; the graph shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to let@@ tering or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; most people don &apos;t want to see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you that the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Beach quot ; in French Norman@@ die 60 years after landing is present , you may even hear the silence . so the inscription has changed your perception of this panorama completely . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show images you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer , to help Him over the motif that you moved has to understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is fine if an image is not perfect , if it has the strength to work only with a label for itself alone . &quot;
&quot; if you export your images in web galleries , you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . if you export your images in web galleries , then these labels are exported according to your wishes in the let@@ tering and / or the title of the web gallery system . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of spatial presentation already drives with light speed . &quot;
&quot; you can export the images to Galler@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . you can export the images to the Google Maps viewer even after Galler@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all modified versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; should be stored as information :
&quot; the author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organization may not be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; author title ( syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line ) : associated with the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples for this can be titles like : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a stock photo , then here is the group / agency that offers the picture here . &quot;
&quot; for individuals , this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is one @-@ of @-@ the @-@ kind . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; issues : record errors , record loss , am@@ ending , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , dis@@ aster@@ ism , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread ab@@ err@@ ations &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or brand . these kinds of losses are the ones that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . this section concerns problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics for data loss . &quot;
&quot; to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be dealt with and you can no longer trust you than a couple of years . of course , you can also purchase CDs and DVDs in archi@@ val quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good record devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recorder is not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to mistakes , even if they have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection they al@@ pe them through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a good program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works wonders with CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash drives , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six sm@@ al the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
&quot; record the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store it in a clean , dark dry and protected place . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
&quot; your manufacturer &apos;s warran@@ ties cover a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this subject : dis@@ rup@@ tive study &quot;
&quot; electronic parts of the controller are the most common fault cause , S@@ MAR@@ T can not determine these errors . some of S@@ MAR@@ T are the most common error cause , S@@ MAR@@ T can not determine these errors . some of S@@ MAR@@ T are the most common error cause , S@@ MAR@@ T can not determine these errors . some of S@@ MAR@@ T pre@@ dict the im@@ min@@ ent failure . the expected life time is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can normally be produced without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical equipment does not make much difference , the devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors are different . these can cause severe damage . thus , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause severe damage . thus , protect themselves from the unavoid@@ able result , resulting in loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against sp@@ ik@@ es is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy levels and provides the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar , but remember that not every connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; since there is an over@@ voltage of each cable to your computer , you should ensure that even all periph@@ er@@ als connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a laptop , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it may therefore make sense to invest in an inter@@ ruption @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically supply battery energy if a power failure occurs . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare your safety with costs to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , a 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Sim@@ ple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as Drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . &quot;
you are in comparison to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition you need to send the data via the compar@@ atively slow internet .
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your images in full resolution . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transfer errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies it is included in the offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are des@@ aster@@ ers . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transfers are sus@@ cep@@ tible to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and B@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem is at least secure data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; the worst thing is that nobody tells you if a transmission error occurred , not if this happened in your hardware . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they create inter@@ ferences within the data streams . these errors are un@@ noticed in normal file systems . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle record errors on a low level . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is available for &amp; Linux , and Windows . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its B@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS uses and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
&quot; do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the job systems . not@@ ebooks , the share of theft is 50 % . &quot;
data loss due to viruses is less common than most likely think . it leads to a lower damage than e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; nobody has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
&quot; open Source File Systems are less pr@@ one to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden inter@@ ruption during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been completely saved before the problem arises , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
&quot; today &apos;s cameras are heading towards the 10 meg@@ apixel cameras . even though this resolution is too high for compact cameras and high @-@ quality optics , the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats . &quot;
a 750@@ GB hard disk drive you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anybody else responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected every year from a data loss . so backup your data frequently to a plan and test this backup before you make any hazardous as the re@@ installation of your operating system or the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
&quot; suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aviation failures : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ patch always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as stated above , a common reason for data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential Lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot of two times : the complete backup and the last differential f@@ use .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time at which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference between files that really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
save important images directly after saving them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium .
&quot; at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . &quot;
&quot; themes : metadata in the image file saved IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original keeping , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ loc@@ ating images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years , that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood and adol@@ escence , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is unfor@@ es@@ e@@ eable due to your nature , you have to look at everything that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate yourself as the current system goes backwards . the fewer variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
&quot; today virtualization is available for everyone . so , if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or change your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to magni@@ fy on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it to a new disk :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new disk was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&quot; $ / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of disk if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no more software can read , then you can create them yourself . this task will be easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more . &quot;
&quot; PNG was designed as an open source standard to replace GIF . it can save much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . &quot;
TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression algorithm ( DE@@ FLA@@ TE ) . it manages images in high quality but requires very large files .
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is required to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are already available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; technology of the 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive a original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP adap@@ ts to this because it can save the metadata separately from the image file . however , you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ CM@@ I include the work on an architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images on the camera edi@@ um are , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again and digi@@ ti@@ sed ; then you should add the metadata again . these were sometimes tr@@ unc@@ ated by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them into web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam . in the addition of a photo to an album , you will find a description of how to add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting pictures to your album database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with and digi@@ ti@@ sed ; to use , connect them to the computer , turn the camera to display mode and turn on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . with some cameras , it may take a while . if the connection is made , a he@@ el indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file allocation for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; the met@@ a metadata shows the internal metadata such as the Exif , manufacturer notice , GPS etc . this information is the same as when the metadata side bar is from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or the image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button to download and then the selection of all of them . this loads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . when downloading the pictures are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired using the default selection methods from &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the button to download and then download the selected . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , a new option is available for download . in this case , the new images have been downloaded with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you want to download the buttons all or download the selected album , you will see a dialog with which you can select the target album in which the photos are sorted . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to restore photos that you deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully deleted from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do so by using the camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally recycled after the photos were deleted from the camera . this may result in double fil@@ en@@ ames , if you upload photos of different recording galleries into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the image has been made in the fil@@ ename . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mir@@ r@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based subtitles . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day . &quot;
&quot; the first two affect the data above the author in the section Standard Aut@@ ori@@ ety . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the Exif information will be copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you wish to use another date format than standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . turn on the option date &amp; time . for further modifications , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera file name option , you have the option of downloading the fil@@ en@@ ames in lower case letters . or in upper@@ case letters , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ ename , the &amp; digi@@ kam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera will be available in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ ti@@ sed ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time point recording to perform an automatic rotation during loading . not all cameras provide this information . in the page bar section Metad@@ ata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is normally switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the button Advanced and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window . &quot;
all images with the same date are loaded into the same album . not all cameras are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . not all cameras provide this information . in the section page bar met@@ a data you can read out what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case it saves &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn this option on . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums on the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , and digi@@ ti@@ sed ; you where the images should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear . select the folder you want to start and press OK to start the upload . the images are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position that can be displayed in length and width levels , which can be displayed on a map . the identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability . &quot;
&quot; if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser to display the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or just want to document this aspect , it is well to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a few who work together with GPS receivers . either as a map module or by transmitt@@ ing the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR ri@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you need to save these data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format that is supported by module to geographic mapping .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data from images and GPS . on the following page you can use the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the length and width grade or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ Tool of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre@@ defined coordinates which are created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google.com does not display European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these , clicking on the icons on the left . &quot;
select action can be displayed on a given preview or start image editing . you specify the default behaviour of &amp; digi@@ kam ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardization and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera file . even when it comes to database synchron@@ ization , these data are written in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line : this field should contain the professional name of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as employed photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a more detailed description of the Autor@@ outer , it must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author if it is for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then the group or agency should be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this results in that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; imported without being lost .
&quot; save picture labels as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the lab@@ eled images embedded in the images . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse cursor rests over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; to fix , you can add and remove the file extensions of that list . &quot;
you can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
&quot; some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ized mode is not available . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can select the toolbar to use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of a picture can be marked with dark and bright color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia about the explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the PNG compression setting , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality since PNG uses a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the TIFF files option , you can comp@@ ress the DE@@ FLA@@ TE compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no influence on image quality , since the DE@@ FLA@@ TE algorithm works loss@@ less . &quot;
&quot; with the loss @-@ free JPEG @-@ 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the loss @-@ of @-@ loss settings , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph is written , metadata has not been supported yet , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image processing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing . &quot;
&quot; the default acceptance is that all green pixels are equal . if the straight green pixels of the CCD sensor respond more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a bit soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 mesh pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the Automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is to use a solid color balance , which was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight on a white map . &quot;
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the pointed @-@ lights , so the parts of your images are burned to capture as a translu@@ cent white . finally , use the setting @-@ through white in the settings . the setting colors resolve some unusual results since they display the pointed lights in various ros@@ at@@ ars . last@@ ly , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much colour or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option re@@ construct , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can / should therefore be individually adapted for each image . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be made later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; image processing . in order to keep the time for the demo @-@ icing , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; a dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the particle data generated by the color filtered image sensor , which provides many cameras and which provides a matrix of color @-@ color pixel . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction . &quot;
&quot; after some tests , it looks as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ esis Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . but as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ esis Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . image is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color deviation of your l@@ enti@@ ls , you can put the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color difference correction , since you are carried out during raw conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information as to translate color information from a color space to the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ask when an image is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files .
&quot; color Profile Fol@@ der Set here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c where you can save all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles you have here the option &amp; quot ; default source ; for your profiles to be depos@@ ited . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your images color does not manage the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should be used to the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain any colour @-@ t@@ apping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not have a color ton@@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the soft Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate as your image would be restored by a device . this is very useful before you can print a picture , as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for . unfortunately not in the models of Canon . so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that were written to work with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of the available modules . &quot;
short @-@ commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Sh@@ ort@@ cuts .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from the K@@ IP@@ I project at http : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of slideshow should be easy to understand . the upper control adju@@ sts the time between the image transi@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes switch the metadata one or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera features show a list of all the currently supported cameras on the left . on the right side there is a button Automatic Det@@ ection , which is trying to identify a camera connected to the computer . below are the port settings . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire storage is supported . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( IEE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera selected from the camera list . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you can mount your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with digi@@ ti@@ sed ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , place it in the display mode and turn on . &quot;
&quot; if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after setting up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the Cam@@ eras of the Main Window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert them here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can set the conversation between &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you can find more details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes caused by the right side bar may be tac@@ itly caused by &amp; digi@@ kam , if you use the option to apply changes in the right @-@ hand side bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to save the changes using the button changes . &quot;
you can also display the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ kam ; to tie at startup . this acceler@@ ates under certain circumstances the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; .
&quot; setting Bei@@ m Start searching for new photos forces &amp; digi@@ kam ; to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if something from the base folder was deleted , then digi@@ ti@@ sed ; you , if it is to delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; used to customize the main window to suit your tastes . you can select these settings under Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for and digi@@ ti@@ sed , you will find further information in this tutorial . &quot;
you can use them to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry / Edit entry .
&quot; the image processing includes a set of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam , so you may not be part of your distribution . you may find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the editing section . &quot;
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ ename , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top edge and among them the toolbar buttons for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
editing functions of image editing change your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo before you save file save or button Save from the toolbar . note that you can not recover the original photo once you have saved the picture .
so you should customize a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with file Save as .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using Rec@@ over from the File Rest@@ ore menu or using the button The Rest@@ ore of Image Processing Rest@@ ore in the toolbar . you then lose any change you &apos;ve done in the photo since the last saving . &quot;
virtually any action of image processing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit Deb@@ undo and Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Rec@@ over from the menu .
&quot; if you frequently use this , you should remember the short@@ cut , Ctr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and re @-@ establish Ctr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press a moment longer via the default or re@@ install button in the toolbar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will also be und@@ one or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image upload , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes in the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can start in the photo and zoom in by using Ctr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the check menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select a magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
view full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you will be displayed in the normal view where you can use the Es@@ c key .
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File menu and get the default print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print individual pictures or entire sets . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select print wizard from the menu Album Export job wizard . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation file , even in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear again .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . note the note below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the inscription features are copied to the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications you should consider these restrictions .
&quot; after you have commented on it , use either the button App@@ ly or simply switch to the next image , the let@@ tering are then saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the user button , there is a button more . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done when you choose a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the rating from the side@@ bar is always applied to one image . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . the encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword list shows a search box to filter the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords previously used in this and digi@@ ti@@ sed session . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the given search word . you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities in search of a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords in a series of images . if you have typ@@ ed various keywords , they are saved for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by selecting the respective check@@ boxes in the tree . all tags of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
&quot; if you select multiple images in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this only applies to the highlighted image and not to the entire range . if you want to choose a keyword , please refer to the Key@@ word filter section . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their Album , - Dat@@ a- , keyword and search views . if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop words . suppose you have selected several images in the main view , so you can simply drag it from the right @-@ hand side bar and put them on the selection . &quot;
&quot; in the upper sample , the main window displays the images on a cal@@ ender day . the keyword filter is on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off in Settings Miscellaneous .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it is a problem , you can easily change it by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot;
3 ) : the argument for the operator that is a name or string that is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can set an Advanced search for all the elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is the colors that come from your camera or scanner to have a predictable departure from the actual photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are equal to those of your camera or scanner and the colors you print or publish in your digital dark@@ room .
&quot; if the theme is on colour management , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants . in addition , you should provide information with deeper information on each point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide you with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you can get the desired results . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( further information can be found below )
your only other image editions are by e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should you use another color space and have to worry about color bl@@ ink@@ age ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colour spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent page and then click info and then information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I need to calibr@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to cal@@ mer your monitor , since s@@ RGB works out that your ; on@@ itor is col@@ alli@@ ed from s@@ RGB . the sound@@ proof@@ ing of your monitor closes the circle . if you are working as the s@@ RGB colour space , you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use an appropriate monitor profile or both . &quot;

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore use it before you attempt to manual manual processing .
&quot; the functions Norm@@ alize , Comp@@ are , Automatic balancing and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rection Automatic correction try automatically to make the best of your colors . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ous levels over the whole picture so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest point is as bright as possible without changing its shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed .
&quot; like this : this method adju@@ sts the brightness channel of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . this results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation which causes either miracles in a picture or it destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatically compens@@ ate : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it calcul@@ ates the dark and bright boundary @-@ tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete Hist@@ o@@ gram@@ mes area . &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible area and a re @-@ mapping of all values in between . this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the White Balance from &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in the rough mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
&quot; thumb@@ nails can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image and the preview of the target image are adapted . if you want to see the original white balance , then click on the sub @-@ window . &quot;
the thumb@@ nail preview features a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; in the upper right corner a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lighted images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shade adjustment lets you improve the blade details of your photos or also dim down . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the controls above , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is exposed . you will see the combined result in the white balance . this is indicated in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . any adjustment of the white balance you have set can save you into a text file and then load again later .
the Pre@@ ferences button res@@ ets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will give a different photo than your original . if you save this your original image is changed .
&quot; you can set the coding depth for each color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this coding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats PNG , PN@@ M , TIFF , and DNG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour ton@@ mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for using color profiles can be used to rate the chapter of Color administration .
this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and allow you to adjust your settings so that you can use them for multiple photos at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always have the same error and you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the digi@@ ti@@ sed ; tool color effects provides you four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ister filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , solar @-@ ization , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect . the colored , dar@@ ker areas protected the sensitive photo paper from the extra light . this was the effect that the lighter areas were dark and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar radiation . with approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) , and it processes the ( 2 ) . the intensity applied is 30 % . &quot;
&quot; the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; Eff@@ ect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simply , it em@@ bel@@ ts many photos . &quot;
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film produced by Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are also a couple of phot@@ ographi@@ sts especially those the hardly landscapes established too much .
the Ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on light . in case of large images the filter can load the entire CPU for one moment .
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to change the color contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the photo . you can experiment to view the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors . you can experiment to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjusting can be considered in preview . once you are satisfied with the result use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
&quot; if you can make a photo of poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is based on tone correction for improving exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you will need only the area of the slider for the purpose mentioned here . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into the picture and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the control is to post@@ p@@ one the controls and to make sure the picture changes .
&quot; the preview is dynamically , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left side are the following options available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic division is more useful .
&quot; three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the bottom for the medium tones , often called Gam@@ ma@@ ged@@ don . &quot;
&quot; the three color brush pet@@ tes can be used in preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , middle and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is one button for fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . the compression of the output values can be used for example to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set according to the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values in the fil@@ esystem can be saved and loaded later . to do so , the Gim@@ p level format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on preview the original image to set the output values for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicators controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below is an example of the input values for the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview is dynamically adjusted depending on your settings . on the right @-@ hand side , the following options are available : &quot;
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is changed from the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images associated with a digital camera , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps to continue . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a short part to the right , for example , the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with dar@@ ker output tones and that the corresponding pixel is dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; when you move this marker to the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicators controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is not an effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to blend the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of image processing .
&quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram shows you the appropriate color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are on the right : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate lumin@@ ance , the image will retain general brightness , as the channel mixer then is THE tool to generate great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color comes to a visible noise that comes from the far@@ c@@ row . far@@ brau@@ schen consists of small rough art@@ e@@ facts that don &apos;t appear at the same place in the color channel and whose noise pattern in each channel looks different . if that &apos;s the case you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome version by reducing the colour@@ ing first . &quot;
saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . you can save and load any mixer setting for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicators controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance retain is activated . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction capability . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford XP@@ 2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scenery pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air@@ pictures . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ ge@@ filter . &quot;
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at day@@ time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) rotary filter .
yellow line filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow line filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm bright and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold in the shad@@ ed tones . this is very similar to the process of p@@ itting a pressure and re@@ development in a sep@@ tum . this is typical for the pictures of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 005 c@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ ia .
using the and digi@@ ti@@ sed ; tool texture apply you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged d@@ ots or like a m@@ ural on a wall . the menu entry image texture apply the image processing can be used for it . &quot;
&quot; relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth , or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image . &quot;
a paper texture effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the digi@@ ti@@ sed tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the asp@@ iring eye . under picture frame the module can be started from the image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you insert the desired frame type for your image . going through the picture with a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce re@@ verses it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative , adding a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image with the frame will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing images , especially if you have used the tool according to aspect ratio before . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a form@@ atted text into a picture at any location . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it using the mouse . use text orientation , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties like you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; any setting you selected for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed anymore . &quot;
using the digi@@ ti@@ sed tool template you can place a template using a picture .
the menu Picture St@@ en@@ cil apply in image processing can be used to place templates on a picture .
&quot; for the template , there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for the reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set up your template folder with the button base folder in dialog . select the folder where you copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
after the root folder for the templates has been set appears a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder updates the thumb@@ nail on the templates automatically .
the preview contains three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the below image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this button res@@ izes the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must shrink the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adapted to thumb@@ nail size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharp@@ ening . each of you has advantages in other fields .
&quot; sharp@@ ening is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very fast and easy , but especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined pictures . &quot;
&quot; the sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture of shar@@ per appearance . actually , it does not work a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang . &quot;
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
&quot; photos without focus as well as most digital images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because of the digi@@ tization process colors with only minimal differences to a color dot . this , in turn , means that sharp edges are somewhat bl@@ ur . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally require more subsequently sharp@@ ening than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
images in the original format must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
&quot; some sc@@ anners have a sharp@@ ening filter already during the reading of the image . if you disable it , you get control of your image . &quot;
in some situations you can get useful results by sharp@@ ening a photo with the sharp@@ ening tool . you can use the menu entry Cor@@ rection Follow .
&quot; however , you should deal with caution because the results do not work very naturally : the sharp@@ ening increases sharp@@ ness of edges , but intensi@@ fies the noise . in general , you can re@@ focus the sharp@@ ness of an image . in general , you will find further information and a comparison of all the techniques for sharp@@ ening . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much simpler than it to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten with the menu entry Cor@@ rection softw@@ ae and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red is a very good tool for removing veil from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and preview can help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . &quot;
the radius is how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter . high resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore you should best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
&quot; the amount is the percentage between the original and the caught image , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharp@@ ening and therefore avoid fair@@ ness in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the bl@@ ur@@ ry mask . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the image processed ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 . &quot;
Das &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focused a picture by enhancing the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted Ent@@ f@@ ission Filter algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche folding has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ el@@ ines removed far from original source pixel . in most cases , the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding is even very strongly affected by the removed pixels . it causes undes@@ ired results . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should be 1 good results . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce art@@ e@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ening effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ e@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will still further contam@@ inate the image . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter when your sharp@@ ness Gau@@ ß is . in most cases , you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ e@@ facts . if you use a value non @-@ zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix Size : this value determines the size of the matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circle @-@ shaped sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameter that you have set is saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all cuts , color and intensity correction before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant art@@ e@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king produces better results than sharp@@ ening . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharp@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; theore@@ tically speaking , bl@@ ur@@ ry masks always have to produce art@@ e@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the bl@@ ur . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter , one can show that it is the optimal linear filter . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better in processing small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
the original non @-@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods for focal correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
the regulator smooth@@ es the sharp@@ ness of the realm that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; the ink tin@@ plate permits a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust it here . &quot;
the tool Error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted art@@ e@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the painting @-@ painting was developed by the I@@ MAG@@ E team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as Star@@ points to simplify the restoration . the available preferences are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings fine you can use the Rider smoothing and Advanced Settings .
&quot; detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the picture . a value of 0.9 should keep details so that no sharp@@ ening is subsequently required . please note that the level of detail should always be subordin@@ ated to the direction dependen@@ cy . &quot;
&quot; direction dependen@@ cy Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a movie line or CCD , a high value wave @-@ like pattern is created . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te will best be removed at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; smoothing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smoothing . therefore set this value suitable to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it has to be set higher than 3 . &quot;
repeat : specify how often the algorithm is going through . usually enough is 1 or 2 .
&quot; angle @-@ incre@@ ment da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angular @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is small , it should also be small . &quot;
&quot; integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
&quot; linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the More of quality you get by selecting this option is only minor , but it dou@@ bles the run@@ time . we recommend it to let it out . &quot;
the buttons save as and load exactly this . correct any adjustment of image errors can be saved into a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore you can cancel the calculation anytime with the button Cancel .
below you can see how to remove image errors with small art@@ e@@ facts . the module is used on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black art@@ e@@ fact in the foreg@@ round that due to a bad film storage caused during the journey . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ ti@@ sed ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ e@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot at the top shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ windows details and the Advanced Settings window will remain in the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius checks the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the amount of the filter per pixel and allows the image to be bl@@ ur@@ red . the area indicated by the radius turns over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and therefore smaller errors are adjusted . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the depth of sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pixel distance that the filter looks forward to determine brightness changes . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication can occur again . &quot;
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong you can not remove all the noise or noise tips . place it on a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak rou@@ d or JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically stronger and smo@@ other . however , it also sp@@ ends the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ uation : controls the alignment of the phase atten@@ uation . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filtering radius re@@ acts on variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , noise and phase j@@ itter appear on the edges . it can remove noise points and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for noise reduction that you have set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied to the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use tool to shar@@ pen the image with the menu entry Cor@@ rection softw@@ ae and experiment with the smoothing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the digi@@ ti@@ sed ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo arti@@ facts .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ e@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , movie gran@@ ular@@ ity , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ e@@ facts and local defects that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture setting . the tex@@ turing composition is performed with another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAG@@ E team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect in some areas even very far from it . as a loss@@ less compression algorithm it generates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ e@@ fact quot ; - small standards that are in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and loaded later .
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish . &quot;
below you can be restored like a photo with uni@@ form@@ ly noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera is recorded on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected one ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photo created using a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ e@@ facts that were created by scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; die &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove hot@@ pixels of photos with a CCD camera , eight were removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , which are copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , tot@@ e or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; quot ; bright pixel &quot; &quot; ; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel . &quot;
download this file in the wizard with the button dark . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; when you have an old digital camera , it &apos;s important to take the dark picture directly to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the right dark@@ room to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark will find the bad pixel . note that the wizard shows itself the last dark and will load it automatically in the next session . &quot;
the image area and preview can help you correct the result within the picture . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to preview the faul@@ ty pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the filters available :
&quot; average : an average of the neighbor pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faul@@ ty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the faul@@ ty pixels in the block .
&quot; square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of square ben@@ ds ( 1 dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block . &quot;
&quot; cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic area ( 2 dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block . &quot;
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a broken digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the digi@@ ti@@ fication correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not light the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( shad@@ ed ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . &quot;
&quot; many Center Fil@@ ters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which may be used to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filter , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise di@@ shar@@ pen@@ sive effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; using the large expos@@ ing area of today &apos;s film and colour and gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a cent@@ er@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that was done without this filter . the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ correction tool is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three controllers , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of ampli@@ fication at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1 , or by chance of a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 , to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image using the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of pixels . you only need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . &quot;
&quot; if you want to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing from the color gra@@ dation menu . &quot;
this is an example of Vig@@ net@@ tide correction applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a rej@@ ecting and contrast correction was also performed with the image using this tool .
the digi@@ ti@@ sed ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David H@@ od@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second grade treats the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third grade has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s off the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the coefficient fourth gra@@ des correc@@ ts the removed corners to that of the second gra@@ dient . if you combine these two can virtually eliminate any geomet@@ rical distortion .
&quot; in general : this value controls the thickness of distortion second gra@@ dient . with negative values , tons of distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot;
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distor@@ tions fourth . this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; corners parameter has the inver@@ ted character of the parameter General .
zoom : this value scales the image size and results in a correction of first gra@@ des . negative values magni@@ fy while positive the image is smaller .
bright : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values for the next start . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ onn@@ e- or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cuts or size changes . if you want to re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect would appear to be the Fal@@ se . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and horizontal relief line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to fix the dotted lines . move it to an important location , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the wall@@ - / cushion distortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the menu Transformation cuts from image processing or over the Zoom slider of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motifs like images from the front , frame and paintings , it &apos;s the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film by the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org Web site which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters for movie gra@@ dation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the F@@ ully Movie gran@@ ular@@ ity if you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO @-@ regulator changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows are white like snow !
&quot; since the filter mixes color channels for producing infrared film , especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared film effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
&quot; the digi@@ ti@@ sed ; filter film gr@@ itt is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ulation on your pictures . this is known by classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix large silver grains of the emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the image effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere loos@@ ened from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photography , gra@@ ined view especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ men photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regulator the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you still need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the movie line effect on a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fied ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ fied ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brushes are better suited for large images . smoothing checks the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side , the sharp@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with the ( 2 ) . pin size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smooth 17 .
images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you have chosen to sk@@ etch . these would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob cho@@ oses the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; the digi@@ ti@@ sed ; filter engraving marks your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the digi@@ ti@@ sed ; filter engraving is a fast tool to return your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure , in which colour is not the most important thing on the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ och@@ ian landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , equal to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and lets it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 the image is distor@@ ted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; zoom Un@@ ity : bl@@ urs the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from one center point . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a zo@@ oming camera , creating a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography . &quot;
radi@@ al acu@@ ity : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by rotation of pixels by a focal point . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a rotating camera .
distance : bl@@ ur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to be back in the background .
&quot; motion bl@@ ur : bl@@ urs the image through horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train , camera . &quot;
&quot; this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos , or adding a warm and subtle g@@ low . &quot;
vibr@@ ating sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by accidental displacement of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent we@@ ather@@ ing : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and ignor@@ es them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation anytime with the button Finish .
the ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your image . this gives it natural your images a wet look . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of drops . since dro@@ ple@@ t size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images .
&quot; you can choose to select a range free of rain drops . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face which should remain free . if you then start the filter ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ ro@@ ps . &quot;
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen Fil@@ ters . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it to the correct orientation by mirrors or turning . the tools for this can be found in the Transform@@ ating Rot@@ ate or Transformation . &quot;
infl@@ atable photo is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and shar@@ pen the details ? how can you zoom in a picture , or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here is a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
&quot; the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bub@@ bles was developed by the I@@ MAG@@ E team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the New size tab and are listed below :
&quot; aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it has to be set higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the Save as and Lo@@ ading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . enlarge can be saved as text file , and loaded later . &quot;
you can still take a long time and load a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
you can see below an example of photo infl@@ ating by enlar@@ ging a small image on double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication to compare .
&quot; cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . to cut a photo you need to use the mouse only the rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rec@@ t@@ angle . you will see this rec@@ t@@ angle when you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . you can change the size of the area to be cut by drag@@ ging on the corners of the rec@@ t@@ angle . you can create a new rec@@ t@@ angle by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the trimm@@ ing , use the button The Cutting button of picture editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( Ctr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or save file under the File menu to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rec@@ t@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will remain intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool Fol@@ lowing the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a portrait format or landscape format . in the portrait format , the higher value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; cutting the tool according to aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you use inches , inches or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically centered horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot;
&quot; down in the dialog you can use the Max . ratio button to cut the area to the maximum possible , depending on the selected ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; when you use the trimm@@ ing tool next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the trimmed image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the co@@ aster help make it possible to provide help , so that you can put your images together better . these aids are : &quot;
&quot; harmonious triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ level rule , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rec@@ t@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles on the diag@@ on@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Golden Middle : the golden center is a division that on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 18@@ 03@@ 39@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks , who used to construct your temples and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects used the golden division in all times when you put your images , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number is equal to 1 : 1,6@@ 18 the golden center . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious . &quot;
the golden center provides li@@ que@@ er guides when you put a picture together . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ level rule , the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rectang@@ les of the golden spiral , also called golden rectang@@ les . this rectang@@ les are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line of its or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the Golden Tri@@ angles are also derived from the golden spir@@ als discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectang@@ les . note that in contrast to the harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no uniform tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can be published a static object dynam@@ ischer . &quot;
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame you create an effect created by professional photographers dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t achieve otherwise .
the options Horiz@@ ont@@ al mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic divisions .
&quot; with the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can be invisible . in this way you can customize the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . &quot;
turn your picture with the slider angle . the values on this slider are indicated in degrees . with the button Pre@@ ferences you can set the slider back to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have rot@@ ated a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function Trans@@ forming cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the image is the automatic cutting function . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture slightly after turning . but note the above warning .
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically be re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
&quot; new Width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
corner left above : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
corner left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a bit dirty . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adapted the perspective , you get ti@@ rel@@ ess tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the image by transforming cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; with other words , a rec@@ t@@ angle is distor@@ ted . in other words , a rec@@ t@@ angle is distor@@ ted into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module by transforming sc@@ iss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; create your image by using horizontal and vertical angles . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; for your help , a vertical and horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , like the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have completed the she@@ ar , the picture becomes a bit bl@@ ur@@ red . for a single she@@ ar this effect is mostly negli@@ gible , but two she@@ ath@@ ing is dou@@ bling as much wi@@ ping and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after she@@ ar , the image has a beautiful tri@@ angular hole in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the image by transforming dressing out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; and digi@@ ti@@ fied ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats using &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependen@@ cy on other libraries , it is impossible to specify a list of all file formats available on your system at this point . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF below . &quot;
&quot; if the extension is listed in the list , and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file extensions ; you can change this list of file extensions . you can find more information in the configuration section . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
&quot; image compression is the application of data compression methods on digital images . thereby , redundant information is reduced to save the image data to a more efficient way . &quot;
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save losses if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can also read very helpful instructions under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour . you can also read raw format images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports downloading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ; &quot;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format .

many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam ; contain . your description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ening , sof@@ ten@@ ers , noise suppression , re@@ focus , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog which shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applicable quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image . left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ licate . the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal parts without dup@@ licate . the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview pane .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area , otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to display over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the picture and drop to the part of the picture from which you want to preview the thumb@@ nail . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values .
the side@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data originate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini @-@ program . you can move in or out or hold it on the left mouse wheel . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course this requires your pictures Ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and burning colors .
&quot; the pal@@ ettes files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the entire system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot User @-@ defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders to files . &quot;
the cursor is displayed in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
&quot; the color is described below the pallet view . here , the color name can also be changed . &quot;
&quot; to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box At the end cursor is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the color table on the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write has been selected . this mode allows you to choose by selecting the check@@ box under Bei@@ m cursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copy , cut and paste . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line of line , if there are three numerical values in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&quot; graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program included , according to the program author obsol@@ ete &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ screen viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ screen viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ .@@ The &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ screen viewer ; shows graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; makes ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; kate ; the graph@@ ene re @-@ calculated and displayed in &amp; k@@ graphs ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; kate ; to open or to open the graph@@ ene in &amp; k@@ graphs ; in a &amp; makes ; component to open
load large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to show more than these verti@@ ces )
&quot; further needed software : &amp; k@@ screen viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs . &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graphs ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list contains the opened files . in this case , the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list contains last opened files . in this case , the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list contains last opened files . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; alt ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the uploaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can adjust the menu item Settings k@@ graphs ; set up ... , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a Graph@@ end@@ file outside an ongoing &amp; k@@ Graph@@ viewer ; instance open , eg ; in the file browser or command line , you have the choice of whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ screen viewer ; instance , or want to display the graph in a sub @-@ window of the current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the Setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; when starting the program , you can re@@ open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be divided on several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which are on one side , are to be adjusted to this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page Pre@@ view with a graph divided into several pages without header and with another font
&quot; the Renew@@ able Power page gives the possibility to specify behavior when a file has been changed on the hard drive , eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or let the program ask for each time . &quot;
&quot; the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ screen viewer ; if a graph is opened outside an ongoing session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window , or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is requested . &quot;
&quot; the session management page gives the possibility to set the start behavior of &amp; k@@ screen viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not ) , or choose to be asked at each start . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears on a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up further possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose from different &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the page of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
&quot; the algorithm , the standard for directional graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graphs of directed graphs . the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for non @-@ archi@@ ved graphs . it produces displays according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . in doing so , the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model layout for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs . it uses the fru@@ ct@@ man pure gold he@@ uris@@ tics , and includes a multi @-@ lat@@ tice tri@@ ggers for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm al@@ loc@@ ates the k@@ not circular according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph@@ ite file as parameters , and the comp@@ uted layout of the graph after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can specify &amp; eg ; the &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Algorith@@ ms special options , or even change the graphs with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of graph ( directed or un@@ published ) and applies the standard algorithm for each type of ( dot ; for directed ones &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ ed graphs ) .

read the K@@ IP@@ I module images to read new images and save them .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner supported by the SA@@ NE project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . so you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE installed .
you can also select the source from which you want to pick up the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by displaying the default values of duc@@ r@@ he to select your image accordingly . see the Pre@@ view and adjust the area to your needs before using the button scan the image . the estimated file size will show you in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; make sure the window will be displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise . &quot;
&quot; after you have pressed the button , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image appears . please remember that the type BMP is not compressed and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image to save it . &quot;
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected in the menu Import &gt; Screen Photo ... a window appears in which you can set the different screen@@ shots :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , you will read the entire desktop , only the window under the mouse is read . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other desktop environments , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog will display options of the target image with the above described options . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the internet . with Fli@@ ck@@ r it is possible to show your photos to people that are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world that display photos of your compan@@ ion@@ ship online and show your photos safely and privately with your friends and family all over the world .
the ex@@ porting module to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you are guided through the process of generating a token . this will be used for your authentication . thus , it is virtually your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after the successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented to you after a successful login . &quot;
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing Yes you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
&quot; if the module exports to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which displays the current access permissions that the module accepts . &quot;
the button photos should be pressed once after you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . clicking on the O@@ k button starts up@@ loading photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server .
the keywords field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the image as keywords during loading .
&quot; with the Options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ ly you can set the permissions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option to change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value registered for maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to set the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and l@@ atitude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ographical Loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the dialog shown above is then displayed . to get a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data the same time recorded in the same places as the images of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded , an automatic correlation takes the coordinates in red . GPS lane data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted with GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set here your camera line . &quot;
&quot; the setting for maximum time deviation indicates an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . if the deviation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you have no trace data from one place for images you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ating and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have the right data . if you know that in reality a loc@@ ation is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relative to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same location . as the dialog opens the coordinates of a call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the loc@@ ation can also be found and placed with the displayed map . select the region and enlarge it again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the map can always be selected manually , between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the selection allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . you can only select these albums . the three buttons on the right are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below the display preview and the text will appear in the header of the HTML page .
&quot; the tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be created in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ est@@ show , displayed &quot;
the tab defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder containing the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export that contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . of course , this also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nail image allows you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press Cancel to break the process .
&quot; when the module generates the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the programming messages to determine if errors occurred during production . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press Close to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zoom , or sliding . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been designed for quick image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , an image is displayed in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows to save images in JPEG format , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss@@ less storage is that the file size increases , since no comp@@ ressing of color information is taking place . this can be found e.g. in PNG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please refer to ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG enco@@ der module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
&quot; the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length to convert . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can create a background color for slideshow . with this module , it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slideshow . after that , you can create the module via Extras MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . &quot;
&quot; the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there , you can also change the pictures or the content of the list . &quot;
&quot; the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image changes . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave them black . you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start with the button codes the generation of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow when you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a critic appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to programs of M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick Pack@@ ages using the button Settings on the right . &quot;
the print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also automatically be opened using the machine image g@@ im@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or print out with the Gim@@ p module for direct print@@ out .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert your images stored in RAW files into one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w , that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! &quot;
&quot; first , select the raw file to convert and start the module . the Raw Image Converter Window then appears in mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; the basic parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness , and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ ename is the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it . &quot;
&quot; Tagged Image Format , TIFF , re@@ tains all the information of your image and uses loss@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you plan to edit your images frequently or later use them elsewhere , you should not choose the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG as memory format , the metadata contained in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start converting the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel . &quot;
&quot; the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . however , this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce or magni@@ fy the image . four types of image changes are provided :
&quot; proportional ( 1 dim . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 dim . ) : res@@ ize in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen size .
not Pro@@ por@@ tional : not proportional size changes in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; preparation : prepar@@ es the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adapted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
&quot; after you started the module , the pictures window will be displayed with the pictures selected by you . you can add more images to the button with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview is displayed on the right @-@ hand side . &quot;
you can also drag images to the picture list and place it to add the list of images to be sent .
with the button images remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after selecting all the pictures you can open the New Message window of your e @-@ mail client using the OK button . you only have to add the addresses and the subject .
make sure not to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple emails when you want to send many pictures .
the email window will be used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and added the mail . &quot;
&quot; the PNG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . so you should use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG image file format and the original files in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ i@@ View data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages in search of errors . your e @-@ mail program will be automatically started at the end . with the closing of the button , you can close this window . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au , a window will appear with questions like you want to show your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL option option in the presentation enables very elegant image transi@@ tions using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , because otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the File Name option displays the fil@@ ename of the images in the lower left corner while the presentation is displayed .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a loop loop . you can then cancel it manually with Es@@ c ; Cancel .
the images random@@ ly choose to show that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used to order the images in the album .
&quot; between the images , the temporal distance between the images can be set . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the transition effect . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly sel@@ ects a different effect at each transition between the images .
&quot; during slideshow , you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on . &quot;
&quot; with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start the presentation again , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slideshow . &quot;
&quot; on the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current fil@@ ename , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the desktop .
&quot; this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected menu option , as background for your K@@ DE desktop . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have provided your pictures and videos with comments , you can browse with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; browse through them , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , are now present in each group , i.e. in people , places and in the group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have entered your images and videos with comments . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . in the following each one is described . &quot;
&quot; when using the mouse on the record person , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images shown on which both persons are visible . through this selection method , you can limit the number of pictures displayed from a few thousand images to a few individual images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your coverage area . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person to save your own thumb@@ nail , this is of course also valid for locations , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . &quot;
&quot; in order to display images next to the names , select the button which is on the right side of the toolbar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can choose which view you want to use for the current category . &quot;
&quot; to do this , you will need to select the image for each individual person . to do this , you will need to open the picture @-@ view window ( described in more detail ) and in the context menu you can select the image for the appropriate person . in the text window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and then choose which part of the picture should be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you invoke the search in the main window , a dialog will appear that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can see this dialog on the image again . &quot;
&quot; the date can be either a part of the total file , e.g. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use an area of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images according to specific names as you can see in the picture . here , according to images where Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read hand@@ books , but rather try to try different functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , screen@@ shots and introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select the demo in the first dialog , if you start with k@@ photo@@ album ; start the first time , or select in the menu Help menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; start demo . as a result , some sample images are loaded and you can test the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar see here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar displays a different unit . you can switch between units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the strip only 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can view the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the time bar will always display the current date of the currently displayed pictures , if you navigate in preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; introduces you two ways to create HTML pages with your pictures . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other one is available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version is described which you can create via the menu File HTML ... &quot;
&quot; before creating HTML pages , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and purpose . in the following , each area is described more precisely . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the tag and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , choose if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created on the overview page . close information about export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , you can select which information should be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed to the viewer even without description . for example , that all images are displayed by a party . for example , that all images are of a party . &quot;
&quot; in this section , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear , which is why it is not specifically dealt with . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . therefore , those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download images , such as a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified . so , it can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , specify the different folders and the URL where your site is saved . &quot;
best select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
&quot; first , you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved . this folder is stored and next time automatically added . this allows you to select either a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if they are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages are created , should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you have to manually copy it to it . so the import function , see , properly works , you need to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings described above have all three based on base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name is set in the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have already spent a lot of time choosing the image information , persons on the pictures , recording location , etc . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can either ex@@ porting a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images in the .@@ k@@ im file . if the images are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file by means of HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described which you can export through the File menu . &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three choices available :
&quot; to copy the manual to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album with the Automati@@ cally option to copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want this , simply select the Export File option . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send images to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu ... select it will be &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
&quot; the wizard to import is made up of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) while this category is in your database people . therefore , in the third dialog box , you will be asked to import the categories of the file to be imported and which categories will match those in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for example , see the image . &quot;
&quot; if you see pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will get the different steps from ( 1 ) Set of information about your images , via ( 2 ) the search and view , through to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual you talk about pictures , but often this also includes videos . &quot;
&quot; this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notice the folder in which your images are stored and use it automatically when future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start a different folder tree with pictures , you can start with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / index.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; using the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; setting up ... you can go to a window , which allows you to change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will explain the different settings options . &quot;
&quot; on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can view settings options and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call by pressing a button on the F1 key and one click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; you can also create your own groups , such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog that is used to process existing groups already . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section , sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of all groups of a medi@@ ator as explained in . &quot;
in the left half of the window you can select the category that you want to configure . in the left half of the window you can select the category that you want to configure . in the left half of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it shares its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be called via the module modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most of the modules have a help page you can access via the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules of multiple applications are used together , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules using the command line using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say I would have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , which may be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage when sharing features with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications can arrange their pictures in albums . even though &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ated &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all images that show you the picture shows at the moment . &quot;
next to the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , e.g. all persons , each entry in this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category that you have defined in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category of people , it will do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do , so if you had chosen people to view and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used from any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and tool bar at the top . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to ann@@ ot@@ ate any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . to this include information about the persons depicted on the picture , etc . you can set each picture individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if for example , shown on all images Jes@@ per and all pictures taken in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all of these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these comments by using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , since you will always use them whenever you enter information about your images . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and are shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons can be found , so that the used names are moved upwards to find and categ@@ ori@@ ze people more quickly . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabetical list , click on the list for sort by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for each picture individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons , which are under the preview of the image on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded several images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as a group . to show you that it is an over@@ board , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the Not@@ ation di@@ alogs it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can simply drag one entry to a category and submit it to a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this assumes that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . see this . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the note dialog by clicking and drag@@ ging the bar , which make the top edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window from a frame by drag@@ ging it out of the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button to save the current layout and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide a frame completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then window on / off . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can see the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . just try it . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the image viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and select either the Rem@@ ove button or select Del@@ ete the Edit menu . now you will see the window you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use images without saving you on your hard drive .
&quot; images in which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard drive . however , for images 5 @-@ 9 , the thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also view these pictures with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy it back . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images , you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you can filter the pictures so that at the end those who can see your little sister can control and click on the menu entry All except the current view block . &quot;
&quot; so you have set which images are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , so that all the images you have blocked is hidden . if you want to get the images displayed again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password which needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the Privacy Settings menu . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe . on the one hand , all images on the hard drive and on the other can access the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is used only for those who are familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar with the view of private images . &quot;
why you have all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and describe hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to see them some@@ time . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album has a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
&quot; the viewer can see you in . of course , he shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered through the picture , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the information box on the top part of the picture you want to see , you can drag it with the mouse and drop elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , see , find suitable entries to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu .
how often it loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image by pressing Ctr@@ l key and Plus or minus .
&quot; a very useful capacity of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is to be able to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can move in the picture and zoom in . you can easily pull a rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse button . with the minus button you can zoom in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rec@@ t@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the dot button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the mouse button sets the zoom , so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zoom oper@@ as that work in videos that are in and out @-@ zoom with the plus and minus key are .
&quot; with the turning functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image using the menu item notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; in the moment you can view images , you can find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . at the moment you can view it and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter that name . you may prefer to select it only to highlight the image and view more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you look one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while you look at them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking on the characters A , B and C . &quot;
&quot; this is described in detail . then , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in preview screen . if you want to view categories in the thumb@@ nail , you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the letter for the feature after selecting the image . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture .
&quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way , you can reverse your mind later . &quot;
&quot; in order to switch the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to switch to the painting mode from the context menu . to end the painting , just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you have absolutely read and understood . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire modes views yellow .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the item where you want to insert the object and click on the toolbar icon or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are multiple possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will pop up so that you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with Del@@ ete , either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message is displayed with an error description . then , you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly or Cancel changes with Cancel . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the Setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL User documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; click preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . as pres@@ et@@ ting , the whole texture is rendered , even if you want to render a sub@@ ordered item ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , tick local . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the camera control points . you can drag the control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for moves . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse within the whole window . &quot;
each object has a field of visibility as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the higher @-@ level object or as an absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected or their level of view smaller or equal to the field of view of the scene selected in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window orders and easily switch between different configurations . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or under one view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ t@@ angle displays the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views on one another , pull the starter in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map front in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement is floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . in order to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the starter to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left in the connector bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you can find entries for any type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any place . &quot;
you can save the current window view with View window order . it will display a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program has to be properly installed . as this manual was written , was &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar or select the View scene icon . &quot;
&quot; an R@@ ender mode matches the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click the The render settings icon in the toolbar , or select R@@ ender modes in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination with quality you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user Re@@ flexi@@ ons illumination . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the User Manual to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . &quot;
&quot; these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors .
&quot; if you switch anti@@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling .
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray follows a ray per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold , both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you adjust the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually followed and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion allows you to adjust the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch j@@ itter@@ ing , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the final setting for the quality of the rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; on this map , you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is transparent if the associated rays are not an object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import scene , select the Import menu item Import ... and select a file in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not the full control of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . if error messages or war@@ nings appear when im@@ porting error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
&quot; if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End . &quot;
&quot; you can drag objects from object tree to the editor to export the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source text of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; when you click on help in the property tab , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version . supported versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ t@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type identi@@ fier .
&quot; you can set the object of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more detailed wire model and therefore better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross high degree of detail for extended proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an advanced projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions from perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this property results in a better approxim@@ ation for proj@@ ections , but requires more time to render . &quot;
&quot; if you tick the wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is shown in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the floor , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the floor is shown in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you tick the edge smoothing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and threshold value can be adjusted . &quot;
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window regulations section you can explain how to create and store window regulations .
drop down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list Exist@@ ing window orders displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement allows you to create with the button add and delete a selected arrangement with the button Rem@@ ove .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all the views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created with the button add and delete selected views using the button Rem@@ ove .
&quot; with New column , create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , using map card you will get a card map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without any precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should consider the following war@@ nings carefully before you compl@@ ain that as a result you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture . &quot;
if you have installed anything error free you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement :
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation , so that you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will have to use these menus and symbols , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry Edit Del@@ ete . so you have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; as the camera sees the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the scene of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name of the camera . if you click on it , you can see the content of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , see more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points where you can change the camera &apos;s point of view . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired place . &quot;
&quot; if you press the user button or press Enter , change the wire model views and the object tree immediately according to these settings . as a result , you see here the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the bottom for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( insert end @-@ body header ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
&quot; a good advice : choose the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly or Enter key . in the object tree the new name is displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the pattern view now also shows the level , even though at the moment only as a fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the level expands up to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . in this case , you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment select some simple . &quot;
&quot; in both cases there is a dialog where you can select the object to be inserted . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the Property View ( name = bottom pigment ) , by clicking on the button preview , you can see how the pigment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the pig@@ ments preview shows only a matt black material because you have to add settings for the pigment . so , always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time by clicking on Pre@@ view . &quot;
&quot; if you do not preview any color on the header and ball , click App@@ ly and then the Pre@@ view . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you are using your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more frequently , but the check@@ er@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
choose in object tree every time and change colors in the view of object properties :
you should simply execute this step as you have the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; you should have already understood it . the ball is just as easy to create as the floor :
&quot; in the view of the object properties you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget the input key or the button App@@ ly ) , the ball would float above the ground , as you moved the floor around one unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering results in a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step you will find a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already with the floor , give the ball a pigment as color : &quot;
&quot; first , choose the sub@@ object and change the name for example in the sphere of Pig@@ ment . click on the Pig@@ ment sphere , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to adjust some finish properties : &quot;
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press Enter .
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : not even selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good idea of what possibilities are you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully , you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer has hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the R@@ ender calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects like for example fog . thus , the scene is processed pixel for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the image is just black . obviously , every scene that should be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ inc .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and a disk space . &quot;
reco@@ vers the scene in the last saved version . any changes since the last saved version will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you do not have saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit .
saves the current window ordering and opens a dialog where you enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modelling ; here , you can change the look , short@@ cut and standard behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change default commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er using this option ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can use this option to add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Model@@ er ; add and remove commands .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to pre @-@ filter the surface without any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel base by applying an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for displaying .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the image size or in full screen mode .
using &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files you can view by clicking &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
&quot; you can set , whether each image is to be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the fil@@ ename in the browser window . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog set up - &amp; ball show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ball show ; in the other two , short@@ cuts for the display window and short@@ cuts for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cut can be specified for each window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ball show ; already the next image in the folder while you still see the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
with this option stores &amp; ball show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode , the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
you can set up &amp; ball show ; to set up only a few of the file types that the program can display .
&quot; with this option , the display window will be extended to the full screen for large images . this option is switched on as default . &quot;
determines whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right of the input field . the default is 1 . &quot;
change the keyboard short@@ cut for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the tab cards brief commands for the display window and short@@ cuts for the browser .
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
the image decreases by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ball show ; is also closed when no browser window is opened anymore .
view the picture in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it is selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo editing based on &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam site .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user contributing his part to , at least problems and potential improvements . &quot;
&quot; this shows a dialog with a link . if you are also in the program , the menu contains an entry reports you encounter problems or desires . this displays a dialog with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and desires . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other .
&quot; the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ foto ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list . instructions for joining the Developer Mail@@ ing List by &amp; show@@ foto ; . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you so much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo ; you have to select in the menu Set@@ ting icon ; set up the settings dialog . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the range of exposure indicators you can select the color , which is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicators are selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should indicate a light color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can also view them in which you click on one of the five riders : &quot;
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that do not work more than images and save them .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan and store images anymore . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving and save images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of the support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE website by entering the necessary information on this search page : http : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not open or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite Cancel .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
&quot; to scan a picture , the user can start a preview scan and then scan the scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom to fit the full preview in the window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; if before saving a preview in the settings selected , then the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and lie ? s leads to a demoli@@ tion and you get back to the main window . &quot;
the Settings button opens the dialog in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; to save images . dialog to save for each image opens the dialog in front of any sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically opens up a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ ename . &quot;
the default value is your home directory and you can change this using the button ... change .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for automatically storing images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored image gets a num@@ eric view@@ ix of each time a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used for storing . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if Select the image quality not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help starts K@@ DE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button Over starts the K@@ DE About -@@ Dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings displays the dialog for settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; use like all other programs keyboard short@@ cut . below is a list of this short@@ cut and its function . the global keyboard short@@ cut can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and set up global keyboard short@@ cut by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and set short@@ cuts ... Select .
you may set up existing multimedia keys to function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Sh@@ ort@@ cuts work . this makes your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; Amar@@ ok D@@ CO@@ P interface has many general functions that can mostly be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists browsers and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de command line options ; Amar@@ ok also has some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback when the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all required modules are available and use k@@ dialog to allow the user to know why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ SOR@@ &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the simpl@@ est way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; which should be included in any K@@ DE installation . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages allow to run external programs and commands . this is usually called ex@@ ec ( ) . this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . for this purpose , strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script may also ignore events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure Open the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script needs to take care of . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok put the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ ck@@ Change signals that a new piece is played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , ask for more information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) . &quot;
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an int@@ eger between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ er.@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ title paths wrap the path to the selected files in the playlist when a custom menu item is cli@@ cked . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Menu@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ title ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M sends to the script . this signal should be processed for example , storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . these packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .t@@ ar ) which can optionally be used with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name like e.g. my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ amar@@ ok@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension amar@@ k@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages correctly . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permissions : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can load it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.org and attach the link to the W@@ iki Scrip@@ ts page from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; Scrip@@ ts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you just look for a certain title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is exactly the right one for you . and if the decision is still difficult , the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists will automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot;
&quot; usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should not have any trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that can be activated or de@@ activated at the time of comp@@ iling with the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies must be fulfilled so that they can be used . details can be found in the System Requirements section . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates Deb@@ ug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty using the Setup dialog . the Setup dialog has several cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; when the option is switched off , only the Play@@ lists window will be displayed . &quot;
use bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
&quot; design : this function is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this changes the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer . &quot;
mood files with the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it should be started when a browser is needed .
using other browsers : you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
&quot; save playlist when saving , saves the current playlist automatically when moving &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist at the end . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; to keep up @-@ to @-@ date copies visible when changing the piece , the play@@ lists window opens / down to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area . &quot;
switch to context @-@ browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
&quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can customize &amp; amar@@ ok ; the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the fonts section , you can set the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can select fonts for the following area : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context browser . click Select ... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of user @-@ defined color scheme , you have the qu@@ al of choice and can set a custom color scheme . to do this , use the color sel@@ ector switched on for foreg@@ round and background color . &quot;
&quot; reproduction at the start works that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start , the play continues automatically with the piece at the place , with which it was stopped at the last end . &quot;
&quot; setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is used , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the desired font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shadow causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
&quot; using your own colors gives you the possibility to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . one click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if O@@ wn colors are not checked , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de colors are used . &quot;
the input field display text displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your needs . below is a list of available space holders and what they mean .
&quot; the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , which allows you to set the O@@ SD on which screen should appear . &quot;
the Audio Output tab lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers still activate further settings in this card .
the collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes to set how to proceed with the selected folders . &quot;
Browse sub@@ folder recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub @-@ folders to music will be searched .
monitoring changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) add to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
&quot; the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector driver : lets you choose between S@@ q@@ l@@ ite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ q@@ l is required . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under calcul@@ ator : the machine is entered on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . afterwards , the network port is entered under the port : the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
the loading card last@@ .@@ f@@ m is designed to support last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
&quot; enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send off pieces and update the profile : this setting enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar performers : after activ@@ ating this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar performers to the played piece . you can view the list in context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
&quot; Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of it to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a little guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as O@@ SD pre@@ dict that your window manager will comply with the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will for example help . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log .
most of the time this is because Tag@@ li@@ bit@@ um crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ lib developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is slightly more mature .
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries were compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if eg . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ lib but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable autom@@ . turn off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens on a crash ) . if it is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be corrected . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ info , but do not feature as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Er@@ rors when writing the tags from $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( Rand@@ om mode / Re@@ play / Dynamic Play@@ list ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 .
&quot; if you get this error : amar@@ k@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ k@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok used the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ oc@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any colli@@ ding Q@@ t or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok finds the correct version first . &quot;
you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the Forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one error , if something is in the recti@@ fication of a defect in Amar@@ ok itself . &quot;
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist appears .
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start window has been converted into the stati@@ stic window . you will find it under Extras Statistics . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user , while the points are automatically calculated . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the list box of the playlist and select column . you can also use the short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your choice and then select From playlist to remove from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and drop it there , just like you would do with other files . &quot;
&quot; in the toolbar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , you can save the Play@@ list button . click on it . &quot;
&quot; you probably need to install x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also check lib@@ tool , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations . &quot;
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that really is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one from the back@@ end independent approach so the real question must support G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support almost every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG ! &quot;
&quot; it may ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with the default setting no MP3 decoder ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , Input &quot;
run the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously deliver audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you search for the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to provide another S@@ ink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , deco@@ ded them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer Driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . enable sound servers with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set : &quot;
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed reproduction . read this error report . the magni@@ fying of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
&quot; either use not the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all components . run gst Register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with gst @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run svn register again . now start &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . &quot;
&quot; if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . furthermore the name contains the magic K ... : )
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; run before you go to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened by the soft tones of the music you have before going to bed . &quot;
how to find current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles when you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a functioning SSH environment exists , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user &apos;s username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pl@@ aying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
visu@@ ali@@ zations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; windows are separated . press d on the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size of modi@@ fiable windows .
&quot; the combination of Ctr@@ l + right mouse button puts a piece in the queu@@ e sequence into the queu@@ e . by pressing the Enter key after searching in the playlist , the first search result is played and the search is reset . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the symbol in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
click on the name of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser to display .
&quot; my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . &quot;
&quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support . &quot;
&quot; set the CD , then click on Audio @-@ CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal output you change to the wa@@ v folder , select a couple of pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code , instead , take files from folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , Per@@ cent@@ age F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically , this fits the previous evaluation with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has every single evaluation on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the rating for a piece yourself by clicking with the right mouse button on a column header in the play@@ lists window . then , you can change the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and edit : select review or pressing F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the Metad@@ ata dialog . &quot;
developers don &apos;t want you to specify when you should publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that is not compatible with the short @-@ term set of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok which some users can certainly find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon when playing animations in general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool bar . select Settings tool@@ bars to set up ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . install this under Amar@@ ok ... Visual context browser design , click New Design to install .... &quot;
&quot; the symbol was similar to the War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) logo . to avoid any difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
&quot; Kon@@ quer@@ ors navigation area enables you to monitor and check &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while you browse in the Con@@ quer@@ or . then start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then , click the Settings button ( the top ) and select in the Add amar@@ ok drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
the service is free and you only need a free username and password . Audi@@ osc@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports . &quot;
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need to configure and install these output modules .
&quot; now I have installed &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; you probably need to install the g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same goes for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CAL * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when comp@@ iling Amar@@ ok .
&quot; I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed . &quot;
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , besides g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time must be installed . &quot;
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .

I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound@@ card ?
set up Amar@@ ok in Settings ... Audio Output function the device . typical is for example h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and output is performed on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound@@ card m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio issue with the Arts will not be taken care of . you can of course take this problem yourself into the hand ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed advisor for arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there are the setup assist@@ ants that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection afterwards , or the wizard just don &apos;t like , then this quick start guide will help you . with their help , you will have set up them &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in just a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . drag and drop entries from the collection browser into the playlist . the small text box to filter the collection eases the search for specific pieces . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the playlist to save it . you will find this button in the toolbar of the Play@@ list window . &quot;
&quot; if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have the option to import play@@ lists , you will find various ways to load the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , select the audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD tracks in WAV format . drag the wa@@ v files to the playlist and then press the button playback . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just right click on an entry and follow the burning menu . you have different ways to burn a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally some extra packages are listed that make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more comfortable .
&quot; if you install these packages using a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control .
&quot; this chapter explains how to use all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , including creating a collection and playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a running text display , which displays the current piece or the current stream . one click on this area changes the display of the already ex@@ pi@@ red game time for remaining time of play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch through the available analy@@ zer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , larger window . &quot;
&quot; under the running text display are also the buttons PL and E@@ Q . the PL button activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set E@@ quali@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece of posi@@ tional slider . use the sli@@ ders to set the piece position or the volume . with the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or last piece . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the Player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most widely developed playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player , but don &apos;t let the wealth of functions deter them , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the playlist can be divided into two main areas , on the left side of the navigation bar . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent playlist features , such as the context browser . on the right side is the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough . &quot;
&quot; the context browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpretation . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you may notice that the sub @-@ window has been dropped . the information presented there are now collected in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in addition , the information collected in the Statistics window can be collected ( Extras Statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the music window shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first section in this window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you can see the artwork picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to play the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol gives you more information about the current piece . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time and its evaluation .
&quot; the images can have any name , but pictures with the word front in the name are treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context browser will also display cover images , which are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next area , Recomm@@ ended tunes , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this artist . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set what information in the music sub @-@ window should be displayed . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub @-@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you &apos;ll see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also right @-@ click on it and select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist .
&quot; this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages by using self written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if there is no text script running , you can choose which should be started . &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is necessary .
the Search button opens a search for google.com according to the lyrics for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing interpreter - only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or gen@@ res are ignored . &quot;
&quot; group interpreter / album - first the pieces are arranged according to the artist , and this is the best view of your collection . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Artist / Year - Album - S@@ ort by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year for an album is unknown , the standard 0 - album name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are displayed alphabe@@ tically by one another . the interpreter will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpreter - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them by interpreter .
&quot; group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works exactly like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the performer . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing according to suit . &quot;
&quot; with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection as soon as you change something on the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
&quot; direct under the toolbar there is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view , as well as in the tree view . you can find hints on how to use this filter in the section to the playlist in this manual . &quot;
&quot; you can choose from the last 24 hours to a year . of course , you can also select your entire collection , which makes the filter shut@@ down . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options . &quot;
load - This le@@ ases the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
attach to playlist - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you can reach the same effect .
set pieces in queu@@ e - This function inserts the selected pieces into the queu@@ e . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you are asked for a name under which the list should be saved .
transfer to media player - Ad@@ ds the pieces to the queu@@ e for transmission to the media player . further details can be found in the section on the Media Player browser .
&quot; burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - Wh@@ ore the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed . &quot;
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - open the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; ( n ) Move files to the tr@@ ash bin ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; marking - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ p@@ on it appears among different performers . &quot;
&quot; set up a selection marker - Ch@@ anges the album marked as a compilation back into a normal album . afterwards , the album will no longer be displayed among different artists but again under the corresponding interpreter . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists browser is easy to handle with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the play@@ lists contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the intelligent play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click the Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog for creating a new Smart Play@@ list , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Media Player sub@@ window is used to connect &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod , you will need to find the pieces on your iPod to Interpre@@ t sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them to your iPod . thus , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . thus , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . if the transmission is completed , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and release the drive connection for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; under the toolbar there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden , which do not meet your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .g@@ z enter and press Enter , you can drag and drop music from there to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachments of files can be tri@@ cky by simple dro@@ pping . in this case , the holding down of the Shift key can be helpful . in this case , dropped files are automatically inserted at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; the playlist en@@ closes all pieces from you to play . you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries with the mouse to the desired place . as soon as you enter the letters , only the pieces will be displayed containing the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text box is empty again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the search terms separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then include the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field contain , but not by entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a specific search column , you can search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the keyword : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot;
&quot; for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment bath . &quot;
you can set the sequence sequence of entries by holding down the Ctr@@ l key and then with the right mouse button in the desired order . the entries will then be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
&quot; the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left side , you will find the Add button where you can add the playlist to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons follow undo and restore . this allows you to undo and restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the toolbar there is a unique , magni@@ fying Analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted to the Analy@@ zer by clicking the right mouse button . &quot;
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you can see in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
&quot; there are many more available buttons for toolbar , for example playback rolls and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up toolbar buttons ... Select . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . &quot;
you can also hide the status bar . disable the Status bar option in the General Settings .
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the playlist on the menu . through this menu you can access the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;
one click on this entry will open the window visu@@ alisation plugin . there you can select the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry you will find a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover pictures . you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select : &quot;
&quot; the queu@@ e administration received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queu@@ e , the order appears in the playlist : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece in the playlist , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces to the playlist or use the context menu in the playlist . then , you can change the sequence of the pieces in queu@@ e administration . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are pre @-@ given ( details about setting up these later ) . &quot;
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add more random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m -@@ Recomm@@ end@@ ations ( formerly : audi@@ osc@@ il@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to work with this dynamic playlist .
&quot; in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the two pres@@ et modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ lists mix immediately fill your playlist and you can start playing directly . the recommended tunes will start with an empty playlist and you will need to add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at least one piece yourself from your collection , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the latest dynamic mode : dynamic Mode settings . this will be your existing playlist as a starting point . &quot;
the New button re@@ plen@@ ishes the current playlist and adds new pieces according to dynamic mode . edit the playlist and edit the settings .
&quot; with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist here , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will ski@@ p and they will not hear a piece in this playlist . if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed in consideration of the set pieces . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of played pieces , which are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist . thus , you can easily see which pieces were recently played . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists you have accessed . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click on setup .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Scrip@@ ts install by clicking on a script . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script any longer , you can delete it . select the script to delete it then click Un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information to write your own scripts , please refer to the writing of scripts . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window visu@@ alisation plugin is used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ ali@@ zations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plugin , simply check the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start should show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . to understand the steps , you need to install &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other loss@@ less compressed formats , remember that you will receive a bad quality when re@@ encoding to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created from a loss@@ less format . use the au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect project . &quot;
in this dialog box you can do nothing . please wait until the machine has finished the burning process .
&quot; this Quick Start should show you how to copy &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps , you need to install an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and put the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot;

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all functions that are also called &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases it reaches &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; but higher quality in burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open and patented technology for audio encoding and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition with MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and enco@@ der modules .
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module . &quot;
&quot; l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module . &quot;
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ MPEG , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : additional libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ MPEG , it is for example possible to dec@@ ryp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . &quot;
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio Enco@@ der Module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : an auth@@ oring system fully equipped for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used for adjusting the volume of music files to a standard level , i.e. , for example , to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the various albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces can be played differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to run from CD and automatically reproduce all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to rel@@ o@@ ad recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project .
&quot; save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save is displayed where you can choose folders and fil@@ ename for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file save .
&quot; if a project has been modified and not saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . you can then stop the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; closes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any project that is not saved , just as if you had called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; closes all open projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each non @-@ saved project , it is asked what should happen , as if you had called file Close . &quot;
&quot; when you run this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you are moving the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the basic folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is the ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project .
this feature causes only an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project .
&quot; this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a CD , which you may want to burn later on . you should also prefer cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with corrupt sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to create a DVD copy to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a DVD with the help of copying dialog , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form . &quot;
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete all contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
&quot; open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the write modes and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned instantly by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , you need to use other tools such as specifications . ) &quot;
&quot; burns a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned instantly by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog window will usually appear after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the content view and include properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is checked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view switches on or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is checked , their contents will be displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , locks and unlock the disk . &quot;
&quot; the content view enables the selection and drag of files to the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head@@ board is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ strip has no real function , it looks just pretty and separates the project view from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog for changing ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after choosing one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . thus , the correct permissions can be set for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wizard . &quot;
&quot; open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on startup . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine adjustment of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled by a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , so your taste and the nature of your task is decisive , which of the divi@@ den@@ ds you den@@ ote . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we assume you are using the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following at the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in common , support &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format DVD , and other features for creating new projects . &quot;

&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; an extract for &amp; k@@ de ; it can easily be read and stored in mp3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are also possible depending on the enco@@ der that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in wa@@ v files on hard disk ) and of many enco@@ ders that code these WAV files ( compression @-@ free compression ) by default ( These enco@@ der packages still have to be installed from the Linux distribution ) . further enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the CD ; read and stored in wa@@ v files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or also in other formats like the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ pre@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders are already installed . &quot;
&quot; which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction about enco@@ der , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , use &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the CD ; if not the firmware of the CD ; / DVD device can handle protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass any copy protection . &quot;
&quot; while setting up only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily use of reading a CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert to many formats - depending on which code &apos;s programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the Free@@ DB from the Internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is recorded manually . &quot;
&quot; this is only a short list of commands from the main window . on the page step by step example , there are more information about how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB requests the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the arrangement of request in the CD@@ DB tab@@ s . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be made . ) &quot;
start reading and - if an enco@@ der has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the Settings dialog - the encoding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with another enco@@ der than the default . it &apos;s important to note that before the enco@@ der has been configured in the Settings dialog in the Setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that a file has already been selected to code , rather than a complete CD ; to read and en@@ code . &quot;
&quot; open the Setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ acks ) for program events ( such as reading &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main Setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with various card cards ( like enco@@ der , for setting the enco@@ der ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression rates and helps you choose the right enco@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C , there are other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . the draw@@ backs are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; under the audio formats that lose information through data compression , depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit rate , the differences become less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless supplied with most distri@@ butions free of charge , but there are open license issues &quot;
&quot; + high to very high sound quality ( for high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG , slightly deeper quality in deeper bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sets is present .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - initially 2009 - these tools mostly support MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most musical pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a track . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate approx . 11 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a track . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car wash facilities . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
the CD ; information collected manually or automatically retri@@ eved by the program from the Free@@ DB via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
&quot; in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the CD ; Title to the keyword ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt from l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the Free@@ DB is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs and enter the information instead of themselves into the computer . it is to be noted that all the others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer . it is to be noted that all the others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer . it is to be noted that here is only spoken by text : &amp; CD ; Title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal but I ( note of the U@@ eb@@ ers@@ etz@@ er : this is the author ) am not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be inf@@ lic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in this type of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only be the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator is created to use Free@@ DB , the geographical closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
&quot; a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database . &quot;
which program is used to store pieces from CD &amp; CD ; to store in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more exactly , search in the source code ... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . please note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first , if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; for saving the read WAV files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . in the first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . further information about the enco@@ der is located in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver .
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , you can receive more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; you can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , writing and reading real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ der of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fl@@ ac &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want a copy protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and use our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 keyword ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . an appropriate package for l@@ ame can be found , for example , with a search engine since it is considered as not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permissions on it ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something which is probably done once and
&quot; the second section describes how to read a CD , which needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD . &quot;
here we determine the encoding of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any time out of a CD ; change if the matching settings are found . &quot;
the device name is handed over to the reading program that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card map General settings . here you can &apos;t do much . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be loaded / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; please select only for incomplete information , so that you will be informed if data is missing to create keyword ( tags ) . &quot;
the CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the internet from a Free@@ DB computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Free@@ DB server while reading the CD .
&quot; the second sel@@ ector is easier , a &amp; CD ; record found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ ename or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or fil@@ ename is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please note : if you want to manually enter the database , disable the selection fields and Free@@ DB will not be used . however , if you want to use Free@@ DB in offline mode , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . in order to use Free@@ DB in offline mode , the two select fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card map . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the CD ; information from the Free@@ DB server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about Free@@ DB . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equally as far as the server is concerned , as though many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , as the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we don &apos;t want to send a CD ; data to the Free@@ DB server . the first check box should be de@@ activated . &quot;
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
&quot; number of pieces at the same time : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , therefore try to try yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check out this to check the CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / needs to specify the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . &quot;
&quot; enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be fl@@ ashed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the production of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneous enco@@ ding WAV files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be attempted to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
&quot; this is , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change them again . &quot;
&quot; in this section , describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , was described in the previous section and created in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is built up , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the Free@@ DB is described . the process described in this section must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; as we use a CD ; not yet contained in Free@@ DB , the screen@@ shots are a bit different from the data obtained for a CD . therefore , you will learn the data manually , rather than pick them from the Internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; this example to find . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this has not yet been done , then the &amp; CD has to be pushed into the drive that was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length in the window should be listed as in the screen@@ shot . this is only if the CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
if this does not happen then search in the section Questions and Ans@@ wers after Help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
&quot; attention : if the CD has been successfully retri@@ eved from the Free@@ DB , all tracks of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there will be a window displayed , and you can select the database entry that best suits your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have the check box for the automatic query of Free@@ DB ( on page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also manually launch this by choosing the first button on the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but retrieve the data from the Internet , you will need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 2 : the CD editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the sample on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
the artist no longer has to be entered in the input field &apos; Current title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for individual comments , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the Free@@ DB the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor , so that you can not only begin with the artist and album names ( for example , whether all words begin with upper@@ case letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ irable remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &apos;s &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the enco@@ der to get more information .
&quot; for more information , go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap , for example , can be found under rock . &quot;
&quot; after selecting &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the Free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed above the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece . make sure that all pieces are selected , or click the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button selection out the selection process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we &apos;ll take a look at the window with the orders and track what runs out . &quot;
&quot; on the tab , click on the order window to switch to the order window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the toolbar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
&quot; this error message is shown if you are trying to work with a enco@@ der , which you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list . &quot;
by the way : the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folders for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new record : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this allows you to read and code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code .
&quot; now the last title is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order in the queu@@ e of the enco@@ der is . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x. and 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you will need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you know with CVS , you can download from there an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . install the package k@@ de@@ multimedia from your distribution . if you read this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
this section is aimed at persons compiled from source files and not intended for users to use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls for many different programs has many options . at the best , read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the various cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hi , still read on ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked on after the first start of the program , without any cl@@ ue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program starts ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; if you want to read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if you succeeded in getting the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er von &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , it also has some properties , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver that is required for G@@ US cards . al@@ sa will be included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to KM@@ id .
supports the two existing standards to save text into MIDI files ( song events or tex@@ tures ) . KM@@ id automatically determines the process used .
&quot; when you finish a song while playing a song , KM@@ id will start again with the same song next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can open ... from the File menu . it will display the usual file dialog , whose help you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to the &amp; k@@ mid window . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button playback in the toolbar , select the item from the Edit menu or press the Space button . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will start automatically as soon as you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( for several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played one after each other . ) &quot;
&quot; as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly , you can click on the arrows on the left and right of the speed display and change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the spac@@ ebar , as a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu , breaks the playback . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be saved in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and again other both . some pieces don &apos;t have any text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined that a song is used , so you don &apos;t have to manually adjust the Kar@@ aoke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an event type , choose from the menu Settings menu items or song events . the same function also have keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you summar@@ ize . in this section you can see how to use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the threads in the collection manager . &quot;
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when applying the application , this collection is not saved . remember that if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song to the Add button . it will again appear in the File dialog , whose help you can select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add to the collection is not checked , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series following from the sub@@ menu sequence sequence of the menu Coll@@ ections , the songs are played in sequence as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song , select the Next Song button , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song back , select the button Previous piece , the item Previous piece from the menu item or press the arrow on the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection you want to delete and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers who are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI events are translated into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet if you originally play a piano . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map because all of the sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all required settings for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may appear only once except the Key@@ Ma@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . &quot;
De@@ fine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE Key@@ Ma@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D DE@@ F@@ INE CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TIONS ... EN@@ D
you see that DE@@ F@@ INE is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TIONS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
this topic describes how the patches of General MIDI can be displayed on your specific keyboard . the general usage looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equ@@ ation sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line for any of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to place any sound that this instrument needs to play on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot . to do so , enter the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if now a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( Win ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here is meant with the term drum patch of the patch , where each note represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) . &quot;
the Key@@ Ma@@ P section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with PAT@@ CH@@ MAP , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used above all to map sound on the perc@@ ussions channel . see the key@@ maps included .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and the second channel , do this in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for Key@@ boards , which have percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will always be used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates , in which ratio pitch @-@ calendar events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ calendar event with the value n , this will be converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file there are no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM gives the fact that a keyboard , which is a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event will play with the value 40@@ 96 , a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards attempt to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave above . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try around . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pian@@ os you can see which sounds are played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the knob lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the View from the Settings menu under the point channel view : settings
&quot; the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; so if you find a song too fast to follow the text you can slow it . to change the tempo , use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc ; . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support was compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately . &quot;
&quot; agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
do not necessarily activate the Automati@@ cally add option to the collection . otherwise the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ working area a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a file I just need to switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file to the &amp; k@@ mid window .
&quot; if you want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn off the Automati@@ cally add option to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so , set the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection and open A.@@ Ther@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;

&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; have , or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will send you a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , you should contact me by friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , you should contact me , as I might have the file already . &quot;
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; written completely in my spare time and not paid for anybody for it . I would like to emphasize that I &apos;m just being program@@ ing because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AW@@ E cards was too high .
&quot; thanks to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Marc Die@@ fen@@ bruch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us Pfeffer , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us Pfeffer , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error noti@@ fications or even a suppor@@ tive email . &quot;
&quot; and of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the web , giving us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is located at http : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . you will also find links to pages with further kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends considerably on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same if you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound@@ card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course hear no music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error notification directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ MPEG . the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as for playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; has not yet been finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Mail@@ ing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ ock@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is shown in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred links under the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Continu@@ ous Play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you click on an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the associated entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current play &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do it if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the various files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you have to select a playlist from the menu and select either edit mode , or select a different category . &quot;
all changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without equal to the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
&quot; the animation at startup and ending can be de@@ activated by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; general options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be inserted easily . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation at startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / gt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet , &quot; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; in the source package of &amp; KM@@ Player ; are supported in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L which are supported by &amp; KM@@ Player ; . &quot;
there is a tab for configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the toolbar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player .
&quot; there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c file , like setting up the back@@ end per mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module : &quot;
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; to enable the &amp; KM@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave @-@ flash in the Setup dialog file of K@@ DE must be specified . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; is in a console application to start and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is called within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) . &quot;
&quot; thus always a given back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manual modification of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / km@@ play@@ err@@ c file . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be looked , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR &gt; X@@ Video Port is to be used . the encoding must be detected ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must also work . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , the following must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; internally , various names are used by KM@@ Player for the sources . at the time of creating this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , pi@@ pes@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , pi@@ pes@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , source source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ d@@ source . when it is activated , start playing the playlist . &quot;
is there any hint how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be done as root after inser@@ ting the device . &quot;
x@@ ine starts up slowly and why does my CPU need to be tested for its performance ?
&quot; note : the answer is outdated k@@ x@@ ine@@ player needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is required for compile &amp; k@@ ile ;
Lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be used on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
&quot; most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ ile ; -@@ Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the K@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the K@@ ile ; website . &quot;
&quot; if you have questions about or compile &amp; k@@ ile ; on or if extensions are desired , this should be addressed at the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ working area . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; -@@ functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; latex ; provides the possibility to complete , compile , re@@ work and error search within the source text as well as conversion and application tools for this . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; latex ; reference and powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; makes ; and to learn about its possibilities , the manual must be used to K@@ ate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can begin there directly by reading the chapter Working with the editor of &amp; kate ; start . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; latex ; is the right pra@@ gue : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . as the ur@@ prising &amp; tex ; difficult to use , a La@@ ie ( eng@@ l. lay ) &amp; latex can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; if only a good explanation of &amp; latex is given , it is not the ultimate book to do so . um &amp; latex can be properly ma@@ stered , such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; just like other lab@@ eling languages contains &amp; latex ; an introduction to which the most general properties such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text sizes are defined as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class , the Cologne per begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the Quick Start Wiz@@ ard from &amp; k@@ ile ; is a useful feature for fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some possibilities for creating the document . you can also customize some of the document related settings .
&quot; document classes : this will include the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , Book &#91; letter &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; , or user @-@ defined . &quot;
coding : the encoding of the system is set . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; latex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; latex ; . for the integration they only need to be selected in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users should not be worried anymore . it is a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
&quot; in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; latex ; files can be very helpful to search . once a DVI ; file ( r e V ice I n@@ dependent file ) &#93; was created , jump &amp; k@@ ile ; by one click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the appropriate line in &amp; latex ; source text . &quot;
a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ atted piece and also other information such as the font and is beside PDF the common output ear@@ t of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools for viewing and converting DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
&quot; when using the revers@@ ing search , the elements of the DVI ; file are linked to the editor and once on an element in the DVI ; file cli@@ cked , the corresponding section on the &amp; latex ; source text was cli@@ cked to the corresponding place in the DVI ; -@@ viewer . &quot;
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document the work is simplified with others .@@ tex files . when using a project a project @-@ wide master document can be configured for project project settings .
quick construction : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are any errors in the source code ) .
&quot; file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file will be switched on the most part â and it is not a call by &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after quick construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the editing toolbar , the three large selection fields should be followed . the selection fields were designed for quick integration of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ itable &amp; latex ; -@@ commands for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the Other is available for items such as keywords , notes , or references . the possibilities are : &quot;
&quot; name : this command creates a name for a section , a picture or a different element . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a defined term ( select a selection field ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can of course also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand .
&quot; the last drop down box named Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã e is used for determining the font sizes . it can be set with the font sizes for the main text , the notes , etc . &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; k@@ ile , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . &quot;
&quot; the brackets at the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the written note . if the font size is not set at the beginning , it can also be changed in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source example has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the simpl@@ est way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Building or Kn@@ op@@ per Quick Building . &quot;
&quot; the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; ch@@ ile , the storage automatically takes out . &quot;
&quot; if the document comp@@ iling is missing , the logging should be sought after the errors . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( close environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the written text 12 is created and only a few columns should have another written note . &quot;
the changes are carried out only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no limit ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the read ability and usability of the document . for example , certain fonts , grease pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either using the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive print and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a sentence can be shown ital@@ ici@@ ally with \ \ emp@@ h { Word } .
\ \ quot@@ a : creates a quote in the document . the quotation begins with \ \ begin { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background is presented to write the source code with the &amp; latex ; recording language , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide will follow for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . &quot;
&quot; once a bit of text is entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be performed for better read@@ ability of the document . this should be a quote , a few passages in fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem to use to see the differences between these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , an editor @-@ view or Ctr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed out or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is an independent file format ( F e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi outputs like printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps as for creating the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed by file ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is properly configured ) . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar enables the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; latex ; source code , the conversion can begin in desired other formats using buttons in the toolbar . &quot;
the default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; bin@@ aries . for this only Modern can set up K@@ ile settings ... tools can be selected .
&quot; to check the pre @-@ search , the cursor must be positioned in a line of the source code and then be cli@@ cked on pre @-@ search . the jump to the appropriate location in the DVI ; viewer takes place . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; latex ; open and jump to the appropriate line . to do this must &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set as text editor ( settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor )
&quot; should an error occur when using the fast installation of the &amp; DVI ; -@@ viewer , an error may occur . if an error is present , it is displayed in the logging file or in the news window . &quot;
&quot; the logging file contains the error source in the source code . in the editor , the buttons can then be cli@@ cked on the error in logging and &amp; k@@ ile ; jumps to the defective line . &quot;
&quot; once cli@@ cked on the respective button in the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template to be used . the default options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting empty documents , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch , or the wizard will be used for quick creation of a new document . further information can be found in the section . &quot;
&quot; frequent user of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be made in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or create a new file . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using a new file , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in settings K@@ ile ... Settings in General . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TIONS $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering into document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ TC@@ LA@@ S@@ SO@@ P@@ TIONS $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry in the editor . once the document has been created in this way the following steps should be executed :
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard ones . &quot;
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files created . an easy way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; ch@@ ile ; used &amp; makes ; as an internal editor . &amp; makes ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and emergence of many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many adjustments for &amp; makes ; can be made in the menu directly from &amp; k@@ ile ; out .
&quot; to learn more about &amp; makes ; and to know its possibilities , the manual must be used to K@@ ate . users of &amp; k@@ ile can start working with the editor of &amp; makes directly with reading the chapter . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference , which can be called by the Men@@ Ã ¤ La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; latex , and their syntax . &quot;
double click with pressed Ctr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p will only be selected \ \ par .
&quot; when drag@@ ging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the most different kinds of source code and to highlight these . for example , the &amp; latex ; -@@ commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assist@@ ants can add additional tok@@ ens within the text . this is a special kind of book@@ marks within the text . the amount of editing stamps or the corresponding ke@@ yp@@ ad will be highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character . &quot;
&quot; the editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; makes ; already excellent offers , have been added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for the writing of a &amp; latex ; -@@ source text added &amp; k@@ ile ; special commands for their selection . under Edit Sel@@ ected are the following commands for selecting a text : &quot;
&quot; this extended meaning also includes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only diff@@ ent thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the settings are separated by two blank lines . &quot;
select the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also contains &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with a back limit ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
&quot; to delete part of the document , of course , this can be selected first and can be removed by pressing the Del key . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the key Ctr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers with its own commands for a quicker option . under Edit removal , the following commands are included in the text of the text : &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description to edit Sel@@ ected paragraph .
&quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for more commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with &amp; latex ; . &quot;
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command for closing the environment .
&quot; if the cursor is located before or within the \ \ begin { environment } , the cursor is spra@@ yed at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , you can quickly lose the view over . this command bu@@ gg@@ les the most recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; -@@ groups defined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X @-@ group are a few important commands that correspond to those from editing environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right in front of the wei@@ rd opening bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) .
&quot; if the cursor is before or behind the wei@@ rd clamp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , then jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted groups par@@ enth@@ eses , you can quickly lose the view over . this command bu@@ gg@@ les the last group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups is not destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; latex ; two simple instructions are used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; &quot; for two simple instructions is used . &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and supports two additional signs for &amp; latex ; one . &quot;
this automatic set of double response characters can be set up under Pre@@ ferences K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X can be used in and out .
&quot; individual settings ( e.g. german or french ) can also be used , so many other languages can be used . &quot;
&quot; if the current position within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a sp@@ read@@ sheet environment , we close &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an ending line break . &quot;
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments to support ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables environments and thereby all E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; if this tab@@ ulator is not the associated , for &amp; k@@ ile ; after the next tab in the current tab . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; makes ; already a good source code completion , these are added to &amp; k@@ ile ; three different modes are installed . three of them work on demand and the other two are designed for automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different modes of work under Pre@@ ferences K@@ ile ... can be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for text ) . &quot;
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and it is possible to decrease the full list . on the other hand , the list may also shrink by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . the descriptions are naturally removed when selecting a command . alternatively , br@@ anded marks can be added , so that a simple jump to these positions is possible by means of editing stamps N@@ ames and the desired parameters can be added . &quot;
&quot; under Pre@@ ferences k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; complete can be made to these lists . you can select different desired lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands , as well as ke@@ epers of the general language use . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is not useful for the completion of environments . however , there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the default mode call will have a large list of ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for completion of environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling exp@@ ir@@ ation mode over the menu or Alt + Shift key Space , the command to open the environment is automatically frozen and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient completion may be continued in the simpl@@ est way and terminated by pressing the input button . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . as soon as &amp; k@@ ile ; recognizes that it is a listing environment , even a first \ \ item command is added . &quot;
under Pre@@ ferences k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ fied can be made to these lists . this mode uses the default list of termination mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; supports custom lists of abbrevi@@ ations which are immediately replaced by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Pre@@ ferences K@@ ile ... K@@ ile can be set up . as an example of a query list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le@@ .c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word is completed by pressing Ctr@@ l + Alt spac@@ ebar , the character L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
large washing machines are not helpful for automatic completion . however it has been noted that many wh@@ Ã ¶ s are written more than once in a document . this offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the execution for all written stores .
this mode can set up K@@ ile in the Men@@ Ã ¼ Settings ... K@@ ile can be de@@ ported .
&quot; the files can be installed in sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / mode / of the Personal Home Fol@@ der . mode is for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( drum led@@ ger ) or tex . &quot;
the dialog graphics are designed to create graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics to the graphics formats the sections should be followed and observed .
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changing and re@@ ordering pages . if the PDF Output function is re@@ arranged , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script files , and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to be able to see the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed into the menus creating comp@@ iling , creating and creating view . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file can be converted into a PS file and can be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the quick @-@ build command , a viewer is normally called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will be opened every time . &quot;
a new project will be asked about the Project New Project . here you will find the following information for the project :
&quot; when selecting the fil@@ ename window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function from &amp; k@@ ile ; allows for exec@@ uting EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed in vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be modified in further versions of &amp; k@@ ile .
&quot; first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods : &quot;
&amp; latex ; is a quite sophisticated system where basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to support the user .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . it contains a documentation for the included packages and another &amp; latex ; -@@ Reference .
&quot; this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; latex ; commands contained and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ til ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as a possible help , and tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ til ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all the documents and provides a graphical surface . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for pack@@ et names or stores . from &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .
double click with the mouse or the space key opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; source text editor that can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ ile ; is also a part of the Fink project to allow &amp; k@@ ile ; also on &amp; Mac ; can be executed with installed OS @-@ X .
&quot; many thanks to those who strive for the continued existence of the &amp; k@@ ile ; project , and offer for many hours for the development of tools that we all can use under consideration of the &amp; GNU license . &quot;

&quot; version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; . all these tools use Kom@@ mander as the surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows my pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . if we raise it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked on the symbol for the XML processor and ready ! &quot;
&quot; this application is a@@ waiting a index.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index.@@ doc@@ book is in the desired folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the folder of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time you run my@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the recently opened Net@@ index.@@ doc@@ book file is , then simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current job folder and enter the folder where index.@@ doc@@ book can be found . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to a output on the screen , its file is faul@@ ty . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file is already checked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the file is simply cli@@ cked . if not , delete it at current file the tick and select the file to be verified using other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to know if the well @-@ formed file is , click the Well @-@ formed check selection . &quot;
&quot; to use an &amp; DT@@ D ; , specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already selected , then they leave the current file simply selected . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed using the other file file selection . &quot;
&quot; specify the name of the file , as the result is named , and the file is usually stored in your home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . thus the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality instantly and do not have to wait until someone builds up the threaded in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we start using the Edit menu . this opens the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows you to manage all the plugins included and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ item in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports providing team members and these can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nickname of the user and serves to uniqu@@ ely identify .
one member can have several roles in the project such as both team leaders and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this is done by selecting the team member from the list and the S@@ etze button is pressed . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nickname and the setting of your own identity are important regarding news and comments . see for further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by gathering members of the team : an event for information can be made to the team leader when something specific happens . see for more information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific is done in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it , or a script that plays a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project , etc . &quot;
&quot; on the event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an E@@ Mail will be sent to the address data selected in the receiver list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see how such conductors are set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
you can either select the note entry from the Editor context menu or typ@@ ing @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment field followed by comments text .
&quot; notes can be sent to an identi@@ fiable member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where the nickname of the nickname of the team member is , role plays a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Sub@@ project leader After the sub@@ project leaders , the appropriate range or sub @-@ project names should be given as in the following examples below . &quot;
nick@@ names and roles are independent of upper@@ case or lo@@ wer@@ case but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , the DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supported web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot;
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found . &quot;
the settings can be set up using Qu@@ anta settings ... This dialog covers some pages that will be treated succ@@ essi@@ vely .
&quot; the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags , including car completion , can be changed . the entries are : &quot;
&quot; large / Mini@@ ature of Tags : large / Mini@@ ature of automatically inserted Tags . normal Groß / Min@@ ature means , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ x@@ ml files . &quot;
&quot; large / Lower attri@@ bution of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal large / lo@@ wer@@ case means , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ x@@ ml files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically close : if checked , for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; added . &quot;
do not automatically close the tags : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
&quot; start and shut @-@ off tag automatically : when switched on , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding encoding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using the default button the default preferences can be recovered .
default character encoding : encoding of newly created files or in other ways than file opening file ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . this setting is removed from the same in the project features if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . however , this setting is removed from the same in the project features , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; generates regular backup copies so that in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program , the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in one &apos;s own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , making it possible to preview the documentation , preview , and the source text at the same time . &quot;
set the window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface has changed by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / dependent of views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameter .
the warning message section provides the control of the possibility to disable the display of war@@ nings by hooks of no more .
&quot; the location for the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change . it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the PL@@ - and the source text view in divided mode . &quot;
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be adjusted in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the Struc@@ tural Settings section , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the update frequency of the tree at the edit and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid , divided . this means there may be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ config ac@@ ron@@ ym is something different than in a group valid for Javascript . &quot;
&quot; plugins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third side , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ capable application , at the best known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a default location like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
&quot; input : this information is given to the plugin when starting , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; loading component in &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin ref@@ uses the store . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct . select allows the saving of the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the bug has been completely new . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as support for the D@@ BG de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implem@@ entations via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only a plugin is available , support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; adds . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin selection box the specific settings can be changed .
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface : &quot;
a view where the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left corner .
&quot; a view where all stops , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view showing the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug needs . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that requires a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in normal case it is not necessary to pay attention . &quot;
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug@@ ging session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the noise according to requirements .
send an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger version .
&quot; tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and send information on the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if this happens before a de@@ bug request has been started , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without any information on monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . if this happens before a de@@ bug request is given , the execution begins as soon as a request is placed . &quot;
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without entering into the functions or includes .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , whereby if possible in functions and includes includes errors . &quot;
&quot; as@@ signs the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the statement and go to the next , as if there would be the current one . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
this dialog allows you to enter a variable or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; can be adapted to your needs and how you can &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to get better .
&quot; type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ete ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to give support for brand and script languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and the tool@@ bars . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the tool buttons . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the toolbar . tag folders contain two file types , the tag folder and the

&quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the properties dialog named &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day shows . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool bars allow fast insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a typ@@ ist .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the description language and version so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all is necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users can have a better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations will be explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing else than the only element type . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for class class . the base class name for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; yes , the tag has an ordinary attribute group and attributes within that tag may be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text into the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
this item can only appear once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . additionally there are other tags to describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code used for filling the attributes in tag editing dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag that groups the elements of a list . it can only happen for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
this tag allows for each attribute in a dialog only once ( for example once for each one ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the item is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in dialog . this tag should be present for each field in dialog box ( e.g. one for each one ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tags you define . this element is a only element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ti@@ ghtly @-@ ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces influence nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; character . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements like &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a frac@@ ture , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is in the top of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to start the window and choose Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow . &quot;
this function is currently not available . currently the check is done only when the Tag@@ XML files are loaded in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ ename for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ ename of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
&quot; the file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for editing via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . with this , di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as Nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... click New Action leads to the same dialog :
&quot; the button short@@ cut is assigned to this action . by clicking the User defined button , a keyboard short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ one , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
the simpl@@ est actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the Quick Start dialog or the various See in ... Ac@@ tions for ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
first the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variables in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H / scripts / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H . there are other special variables that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we will replace the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
&quot; % pi@@ d : is replaced by PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text unique will be added to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ ename of the current document or path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be interfer@@ ed with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the input field input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only meaningful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output , error messages , to the default output . it can be specified what is to happen with the text written to the default output , by setting the value to the output sel@@ ector : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to split the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group . in any case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a toolbar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool bar .
&quot; complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you plan to use their use , enable &quot; &quot; Edit Day &quot; &quot; dialog when available to make an input when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulties .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Other Programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit Size Oth@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the start of the day , I have decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually called los , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least , send a message to the user that clicking this symbol is called a &amp; lt ; start ; tag in the current document will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must still be associated with the action . this is done through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , as there are , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ functions to the toolbar , or you should set it to a better overview by some separ@@ ators in several groups . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the toolbar . &quot;
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar has to be tested by pro@@ b@@ ying all symbols to make sure everything works .
&quot; after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust their tool@@ bars ( s ) when a file is opened from the corresponding type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most important extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if someone has done it for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search a existing documentation for format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . we &apos;ll leave the first part to you , we &apos;ll treat the second one here . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = Path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the Main Index Top Element = your description for these docum@@ entations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html @-@ 1 = func@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = func@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 2 = func@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = Sunday 3.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = Intro@@ duction , ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own contents . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ enti@@ ally at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
&quot; spaces influence nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , resources will be replaced . &quot;
&quot; the content section is the area of doc@@ r@@ c file that should be used to create context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; -@@ Scrip@@ ts the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function would be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of separated context elements that are supposed to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
&quot; now , you can easily save your file doc@@ r@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified in your file doc@@ r@@ c ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worthy to be shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ able resources ( D@@ TE@@ P pack@@ ets , toolbar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . at various locations , there is a menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , send tool@@ bars with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private GP@@ G key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the dialog New resource , the input fields must be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , toolbar toolbar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , check &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource war@@ ns and it can then be abor@@ ted . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears stating the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML languages that are currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; but the creation can be time consuming , because hundreds of tag files in tag@@ x@@ ml format may be needed . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . after that , the following dialog appears : &quot;
destination directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name to the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defin@@ i@@ tions@@ command : the string that appears in ! Doc@@ type Tag , like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand them and to be able to take full advantage of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts , without sacrific@@ ing their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; use , available . from tool@@ bars about actions is everything that is marked globally , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this enables the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree that will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory so that they can use only this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be all from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool bars with special actions specially designed for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which mixes the joint use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the building man@@ ors , the card holders with information and the tool@@ bars . please check in , and for more information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the tab@@ s with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries , such as closing , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editor area leads to another context menu with regard to the edited document contents , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the tag under the mouse poin@@ ter or opening the file , if the string under the mouse cursor refers to a file . &quot;
&quot; at present , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . as part of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; to insert it in your document , then click on the tag that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog with different fields . &quot;
&quot; building man@@ ors ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow for information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , to open them and go through . in the representation with tab@@ s , for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation building man@@ sions are available . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view displays all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removal , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be done with the context menu displayed . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; all possibilities are open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on the connection they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work@@ space . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the relevant user and templates in projects only in the project . more about templates can be found . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the scrip@@ ting languages available . clicking with the left mouse button allows you to retrieve the available information to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script to start , edit , or send an email . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one displays the internal structure of the active document . by clicking an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands is opened regarding navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , man@@ age@@ able attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can be changed . the application @-@ oriented application system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot; Documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window can be reached via the useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . thus , for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all the changes to the DT@@ D are displayed . &quot;
this tab shows all errors in the current document mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
&quot; the tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol , and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the toolbar can be defined as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; another feature of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; send the toolbar as a compressed to@@ e archive by &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a toolbar in an email , you can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that is not older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 at PAT@@ H in front of your bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , expand@@ able brand @-@ up language editor would ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; to be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be noted that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follow , in good use of free software , the idea of Why do developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to expand as they need it for their need . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more detailed documentation is help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . each time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest entry is removed . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there , the special characters contained in &amp; HTML are converted , so that they are displayed correctly and not be mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting instruction . &quot;
&quot; convert the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s into the anchor tag . &quot;
switches the block selection on or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; key .
direct to a line number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; script error messages exist !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message pane or not . this is the window where you can see the script &apos;s script and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
&quot; training and switching of the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated once you change to the structure tree . &quot;
&quot; displays the symbol column on the left of the main window , this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with entries previous or next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows , for example , to copy video files to your project folder or a sub@@ folder and then add it to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and whether you have downloaded more inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , manages the project . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects you will find the details . &quot;
load a project tool bar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only stored in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or Project .
&quot; this creates a dialog to add a new toolbar , which only creates the name . actions must be saved using Settings ... or you will be asked when you exit , whether you want to save the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; removes a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t yet saved the toolbar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the toolbar will be present in the next release ) . the menu item will open a new email message with the toolbar as an app@@ endi@@ x .
allows up@@ loading toolbar buttons to the main server where everyone can access it . see in .
download one &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
&quot; loading / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; . if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed , without the entire &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the shop fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current tag settings dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the tag menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus . &quot;
&quot; currently this works only with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent insertion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , ref@@ using by means of tool bar , if this day contra@@ di@@ cts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plugins menu , the available plugins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on it . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activated . &quot;
sel@@ ects the syntax highlight mode for the current file . the list of available listing schem@@ ata depends on the original ; - version .
&quot; sel@@ ects the type of line identification . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , change@@ over sometimes may need time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open window . selecting an entry , the appropriate sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
switches the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
&quot; changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
set the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate you can find details .
a dialog appears where you delete entries from the toolbar or add which you can add and change sequences .
&quot; this should create a help according to the mouse poin@@ ter environment , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form they find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be completed from top to bottom , e.g. after filling the project , the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project . all these paths and auth@@ oring information fields can be set later using Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is automatically filled in . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you will find the server address of the machine you want to access , except one edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ mod@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected log file are used . depending on the remote host setting , an adaptation might be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . several files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great , if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if a project is started from scratch , not hook . &quot;
with this option all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a precise selection of coup@@ ons .
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by h@@ anger or , by removing the tick , cl@@ apping out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard has three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the sub @-@ window profiles or with the Shift key ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of file names ( wild@@ card possible ) , which will be ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to top , including files listed in .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , will be excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when opening the project , can be read more about project views . &quot;
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in can be set with the Options button . in this case the de@@ bug@@ ging is described .
&quot; in the sub @-@ window profiles , high loading profiles ( see in ) can be set as well as displaying a tree view for each profile by displaying its own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration window , you can turn event actions and add or delete these actions . event actions will be executed when a previously defined event occurs , such as the backing of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , it opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . &quot;
&quot; to open a different project , select a project ... open from the project project or the symbol project from the toolbar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows you to select a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folder behave as well , however the entries are missing and open with ... in the context menu with the right mouse button : &quot;
&quot; here , different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see . &quot;
&quot; to remove the current profile . if only more one profile is present , the button will be blind@@ ed to prevent the removal . &quot;
this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is needed and the rather un@@ reliable password to save on the disk will not be questioned .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialogue when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed Ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . normally this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not run a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your spru@@ e shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and toolbar can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved , opened or deleted from the Project Tool@@ bar menu on the Project or the Project Tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps to boost productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , toolbar buttons in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are best designed using the tool@@ bars menu . use and add are different . adding toolbar buttons is handled at the bottom of the Add Tool@@ bar section . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which a new toolbar can be removed , toolbar can be ren@@ ame or toolbar , which can be displayed in the dialog where the actions on this or other toolbar can be displayed . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a toolbar , you will additionally remove the entries action and edit action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the toolbar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with Settings tool@@ bars ... and set settings actions ..
&quot; templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ on@@ ets , code escal@@ opes and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; basically use templates like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any existing directory to the storage room . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations you imagine for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually inserted in documents by means of links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . binary templates are usually included in documents by means of links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) .
&quot; documents can be created by any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . &quot;
&quot; these kinds of templates are useful if not a new document is to be inserted into the documents based on a template , but the same text area . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates are used for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure according to Bel@@ i@@ eben ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As a template Save as a local template ... &quot;
&quot; once that has happened , you notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the storage room under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As template to save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be simply drag@@ ged and dro@@ pping onto the tree @-@ view templates . &quot;
&quot; creating binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as drag@@ ging and dro@@ pping or inser@@ ting over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in the file tree or in the project files , you can click on a folder on the right and create a site template to save and secure a name for the template . by default it is stored in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can specify he@@ aders and foot@@ ers , or dynamically use &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep track of some things in your projects using templates in projects . &quot;
&quot; the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files laid out in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers , as explained above . &quot;
&quot; to set the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is blind@@ ed as soon as the attributes have been shar@@ pen@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a normal folder the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ ers by copying content templates into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ er lines .
&quot; in addition , you have context menu ( pointing right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that is available via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor in two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; Editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; XHTML ; -@@ page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor where the changes are made in the V@@ PL ; Editor in the source code .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP , a small green symbol indicates the default of &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with V@@ PL ; to edit , it is still necessary to edit the source text editor . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes are visible in both the source text editor and V@@ PL ; the cursor is active in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor is active , the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke will activate the active cursor from a window to the other , while maintaining the position in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be set up via Settings Qu@@ anta . in the selection of V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization by one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation is recommended : a small span for fast calcul@@ ator and a large span for slow . &quot;
&quot; the document properties dialog is also called , as soon as a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used to reduce the manual encoding . this allows to change the following : &quot;
met@@ a @-@ Tags permit storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . one click on the list allows the modification of the content such as keywords on the column names and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; using the cursor is possible like in a text editor , by moving arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and dropped by button or remo@@ del@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way about the tool@@ bars , as in the source code editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other day @-@ consuming anchor tag . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars , such as the sp@@ read@@ sheet wizard or the list assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used toolbar buttons . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for examining style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style of the style sheet can be tra@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; except &amp; k@@ de ; still lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already existing at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;

&quot; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g as@@ signs the full path from a fil@@ ename with no path name . in the same folder , fil@@ en@@ ames with relative path to the folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g If loaded , the following input is possible : &quot;
&quot; in this command , a partial or complete match with a pre@@ diction called QNAP or a specified model name is checked . &amp; eg ; template matches each QNAP which contains the template template . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is expanded according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file : test@@ 1 is &amp; eg ; extended to http : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested port must be resolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this will be automatically executed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stops will be re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each flow .

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I &apos;ve written .
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me showed only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later a lot of other useful functions were added later .
&quot; for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparative window . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
also 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is fully supported . this is useful when two persons work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes at the same time . the original file ( the base ) helps resol@@ ving conflicts and simultaneously displays the result . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder mer@@ ging :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and den@@ ies the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make the typ@@ ing work easier by completing only the fil@@ ename of the first file . example : &quot;
diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 -@@ o destination folder k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 3 -@@ o destination folder
&quot; opening dialog will allow the manual typ@@ ing of file names , the selection via the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; in the folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compare or mer@@ ging of folders will be introduced . if for A a file is selected , for B and C , a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ ename from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessary to immediately set a output file . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
the Setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting with the same / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &quot;
you can also drag and drop : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
&quot; which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how much these functions are , this would be a relatively large effort . you would need to create two corresponding files , they are in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; load them and then compare them . now , you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you can &apos;t draw anything out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop of text into a comparison window is supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the drag@@ ging and dro@@ pping text into another program than cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , allow the mouse to rest a while above the line . then , a small auxiliary window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three spring windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing both files is the default color for red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) good to see .
&quot; when differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages , the color is displayed . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( with C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the abstra@@ ction column from the text , is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line break is activated , the line is displayed on d@@ ashed lines . &quot;
&quot; the results window ( under the comparison patterns ) also has an info line with the inscription Edition : , the fil@@ ename and &#91; change &#93; when you have edited the result . usually it contains text by automatic mer@@ ging , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved is the saving down@@ lighted ! ! ! ( use the buttons Spr@@ inge to the next solved / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compare windows are used , each difference is also a conflict that must be manually resolved . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also be a jump of the position in the windows , where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each left appears a black bar . &quot;
&quot; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source . this is just a plac@@ eholder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source again . this text is not displayed in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you might copy and paste somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; text &amp; lt ; Con@@ version conflicts ; however , it appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the results window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : if selecting the sources ignore the options numbers or ignore Ign@@ ati@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ating is mainly used with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click on one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , r@@ unter , side , beginning , end , Ctr@@ l @-@ start and Ctr@@ l @-@ end , as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the output window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the Inser@@ tion button , you can switch between insertion and write mode . ( default is the insertion mode . ) &quot;
&quot; one click with left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ies columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the assembly section , and the editing window has been explained ) . &quot;
&quot; the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ Up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ picture upward / Str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ picture upward / Str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous un@@ solved conflict . therefore , between sol@@ utes and un@@ solved conflicts must be distinguished . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marker into the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( Ctr@@ l @-@ C or Ctr@@ l Insert ) . however , if this is checked , whatever you select , will automatically copy into the clip@@ board and copy the manual copy . be careful with this option , because you could acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; line ends are saved according to the operating system underlying operating system . Unix variants use a line feed \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + new@@ line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ diffusion re@@ tains the line @-@ ending of source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not use bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored at the next start . ( menu Set@@ ting - &gt; K@@ diffusion ... )
&quot; choose a type@@ face with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered clear@@ er . on these systems the button Pre@@ ferences automatically introduces an odd color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is checked , the number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator character will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you press input or return , the move of the preceding line will be automatically used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , any selection will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board . copy the manual into the clip@@ board then . &quot;
you can select which line type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
&quot; the second step compens@@ ates any line . in this step white characters are ignored . even when mer@@ ging , white characters are ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a new@@ line &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line drive &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , and others may only save a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in default this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are shown nevertheless , but they are treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; intensively searching for smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the Automatic ski@@ pping mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before jump to the next un@@ solved conflict . &quot;
&quot; automatically resol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you need this only from time to time , then use better the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ solved white conflicts from the merge menu . &quot;
these options are treated in the chapter on the scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . look for details under documentation to compare and merge .
&quot; if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version is attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file already exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; changing this option does not affect the current program . you need to exit &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; stop and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because language is set globally over the control center . ) &quot;
&quot; the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; above the selection fields for coding a short notice , which is the local codi@@ fication . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely informal character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged with different coding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding to be used to save . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processor commands , you may not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processor command can only be used with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of the pre @-@ processor command . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ati@@ ere C / C + + comments . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color co@@ ded over@@ see column . but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ GT ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ GT ; C , in addition to the normal , a second check column with the required information is displayed . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply make the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes , consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts mer@@ ging and uses the file name of the last source file as the default file name for output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge again , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . you can use this function e.g. for cutting @-@ out dis@@ rup@@ tive parts or to correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first given to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processor command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is only used for line adjustment . you can write your own pre@@ processor that corresponds exactly to your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting the diff @-@ results . however , an external program is required and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is sufficient . &quot;
use this command line for line spac@@ ing to convert upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ \ U \ \ 1 / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert created strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all are followed by the same pattern $ key word generated by the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experim@@ enting with sed , you may start understanding it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diffusion . but it is good as an example of a further processing command for line adjustment . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , thus virtually eliminated . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements of each other . example :
&quot; instead of sed you can also use something different like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for viewing and mer@@ ging . the further operations only change the data that the new@@ line al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can be seen .
&quot; note : in rare cases when you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ like pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal Pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders in ital@@ ics . &quot;

this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merge . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading the folder , you will be informed about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files will be listed that have been compared to that time . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is finished , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 shows ; a list window with the results on the left ... &quot;
each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually displayed together . you can fold up a folder by double clicking on + / - click on the + / - click , or double the arrow keys for the left / right . &quot;
double @-@ click on a file will start the file comparison and a comparison window will appear .
the symbol in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , it is visible in the A / B / C and the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C . &quot;
&quot; in identical entries , the color is also identical even if the age of the entries varies . &quot;
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then also folders have the same color . in folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later , when it is old , red becomes . &quot;
... A and C are identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist ; delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist ; delete the target if it exists )
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist the mer@@ ging cannot be started .
&quot; the mode for syn@@ cing is active , if only two folders and no explicit destination folder are specified and if the option directories synchron@@ ize active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for output file only B ; copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B by A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( uns@@ afe ) , then expl@@ ores &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical . if such errors are not removed , the folder mer@@ ging may not be started . &quot;
&quot; during mer@@ ging , a file will be processed after the other . it status column shows skill if the merge has been successful , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly other messages if something unexpected occurred . if the mer@@ ging is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is ok . &quot;
&quot; if in the Setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full analysis , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , deleted , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the related actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you don &apos;t have a destination folder , then in the three @-@ folder mer@@ ging mode C will be used as a destination , and when synchron@@ izing , A and / or B will be used as a destination . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries should be in the destination folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options to be ski@@ pped by the specific entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
&quot; to merge all entries : select folder mer@@ ging / continue in the list menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current item , select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if there are still invalid mer@@ ging actions with contradic@@ tory file types , a message appears on the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog box with the options will appear , simul@@ ate and Cancel . &quot;
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without really changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , start / continue directory merge operation or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved it , a corresponding dialog appears . then run &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you select the cause of the problem . in the end of the list , you will have the option to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in any other way before proceeding with the merge . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been individually merged , please note &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them once again . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered as completed . only if you change the mer@@ ging action , these entries are merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ diffusion ... ) has now a section called Directory merge with these options :
only files that match the given pattern are displayed in the element tree . several patterns can be entered . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be inserted more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be inserted more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files which are also ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally created files are ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this folder can be set with a .c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems files have a default attribute . in other file systems a leading dot indicates a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
&quot; links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , the links like normal folders are treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; if the option is switched on it would result in an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes down . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and significantly slower when applied to files that do not contain any text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ sample . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; similar to the ch@@ angel@@ ing date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered as identical if they are equal , e.g. when copying the modification date is lost . please use caution . this option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the proposals for mer@@ ging are selected so that both folders are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copy of the newer file is suggested as an action instead of mer@@ ging the newer file as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe because it is assumed that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version will be ren@@ amed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file already exists with the .@@ original extension , this will also be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of individual files , not only the mer@@ ging of entire folders . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder mer@@ ging view is visible to the merge of individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch off the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views using the directory &amp; text window . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file by double @-@ clicking . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory again : directory menu : re @-@ reading . &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diffusion uses this to read files and folders . this way you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should note :
&quot; a path can be relative . or .. containing . that is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file has the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished , whether a link to a file or folder shows . then always a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit permissions or change @-@ date . hence , the permissions or change date devi@@ ates from the original . ( note the option Trust the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
the main purpose is currently the difference viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer .
&quot; usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is used as a K@@ Part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; assuming that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then starts and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and preview it from the pop @-@ up context menu . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders will not be supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diffusion ( now there are comp@@ lies ) already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already points out that it can merge like the diff@@ 3 program from the slide tool collection . &quot;
I use GPL programs for quite a long time and learned a lot in that I have looked into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or to go this way .
&quot; you compiled the program from the sources and probably not tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in default configure inst@@ alls configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE will not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line is not treated as identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is the opposite purpose but this is often the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor notices for every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create extra a separate file format that could store this information . &quot;
the effort for this was so far too large . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text another editor should be used .
&quot; after removing text suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c is left , and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use already many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer . &quot;
information about how to use K@@ DE on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found at http : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file . &quot;
&quot; as &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake uses , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of it . &quot;
cut ( Ctr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copies to the clip@@ board and delet@@ es the selected text . insert ( Ctr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ Insert ) inserts the text from clip@@ board to the current cursor position or replaces the current path .
&quot; show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the function Update after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder . if the destination folder does not contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in later program version . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose the source with the inscription A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed when clicking the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop , change their size , end them or move them . this works in both a working area and several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and on the other .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . the movement is possible both inside a working area and on other work areas . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries of the application and the entries to minimize , maxim@@ ize , on Desktop and Finish . the commands cause the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
this check box is selected to move windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other desktop environments .
&quot; if this field is checked , the name of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops will be displayed in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; cross this field leaves the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is checked together with name , the names are marked with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1. working area . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the running programs are shown as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . otherwise only the empty work@@ tops will be displayed to allow their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply displays simple rectang@@ les with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid , all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops appear in a horizontal and vertical row , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager @-@ Mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move the windows as symbols or with their contents . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
click the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; then set up switch sel@@ ector ... allows the dialog to appear .
&quot; at the moment , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have a write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator . in this file you must enter the key wind@@ ow@@ trac@@ ent@@ mode and assign this one value . possible values are : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package k@@ de@@ base , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic packages . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for various users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag ; . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended to include new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines .
&quot; when you start , a window appears as above . the main window of the screen appears . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fying window . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fying window . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fying window . the picture shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; the default setting increases &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter as a mobile lou@@ pe . alternatively , you can set a select screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the area of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is not capable of recogni@@ zing the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default value ; / Q@@ t ; M@@ ouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold down the left mouse button so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this is also possible with the arrow keys .
&quot; in addition , press the &amp; Shift key or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window will be fixed and only the lower right corner is moving . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
starts and stops the update . stopping the update causes the required CPU time against 0 .
&quot; select the refresh rate ( Very low , Minor , Medium , High , Very high ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
in this mode a selection window will be displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , no@@ ul@@ ades ( with the button Document again loaded in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Re@@ duction &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people , from research or artist to web designer or visually imp@@ aired . &quot;
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mag ( either enter this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ help@@ full help : / k@@ mag ) .

&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter pers@@ ist a while at the same place . it is meant to help people suffering from the R@@ SI syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury Syndrome ) and which every mouse click causes pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter pers@@ ist a while at the same place . it is meant to help people who are suffering from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and allow any mouse click ache . furthermore , it may em@@ ulate pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little exercise . &quot;
&quot; and km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may need to consult a doctor if this has not been done yet . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it again : even if &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps to occur when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click away as soon as you break the movement briefly .
&quot; the intelligent move is activated , makes &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button . the intelligent move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly . &quot;
&quot; this delay time must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; if Intelli@@ gent@@ es is switched on , the rot@@ ational shift time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set , the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is waiting , before the mouse button is pressed again , if no moving of the mouse takes place . &quot;
&quot; this function activ@@ ates a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt , when the first time is started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; move to sound &amp; multimedia , select there sound system and here the tab General . there is a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; in G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set by opening the dialog . if you already press the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset to the user &apos;s last pressing . &quot;
&quot; at the best , use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular the intelligent move should be switched off first . if you get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later add the intelligent move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on points in the browser window , which does not link , does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is that you will not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls which come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be quickly clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . you can scra@@ pe the dirt and dirt with a flat blade or f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system breaks the version of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the intelligent move in this case , that means that &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using another window manager and moving a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . by this , the status of the &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be reset and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and set the cursor to another location . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there , where you want to have it . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to do it . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the title lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent move is an advanced function of &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to copy and re @-@ paste text into the clip@@ board , or to execute any other action you want to use the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; do not use the intelligent move , if you just start using it &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use . just highlight text as follows : run a mouse click at one end of the text area and hold the Shift key while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text , and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . thus , each time and km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be played ; the mouse button press a sound like a mouse click . later you can use the intelligent move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , you need some practice . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use , the X@@ Test extension has to be installed for &amp; X windows ; this should be the case in most of the system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and loudspeaker and is set up correctly .
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activ@@ ates the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter pers@@ ist . this program has been developed for people suffering from the R@@ SI syndrome , and the operation of the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; &amp; km@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that there is a certain time waiting for a drag@@ ging process begins before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag@@ ging and dro@@ pping with the mouse can also be performed . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with which silent users can let their computer speak for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the discussion course sentences , which are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command which will be used later for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the default text@@ book . from the text pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays you can often choose used text passages without typ@@ ing them . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen shot ) , you determine the dictionary for vocabulary . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can compare the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be recorded into the wor@@ ding . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially includes an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a course memory of the already spoken sets ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have a mouth ; correctly set up , you can input the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the default memory . you can select from them that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry Pre@@ ferences k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two card cards , voice output and settings , page Wor@@ ds ending as well as the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the flash@@ card voice output , enter the command to enter the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , you specify the encoding string to be passed on to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text is to be passed unchanged as standard input to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text is passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your voice generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; if this is successful , the other settings on this page are ignored . the ct@@ m language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ dem@@ on , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standardized interface for voice @-@ overs available and that is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text@@ book text@@ book or in the toolbar for text pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of instant speaking , the selected text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the default memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is entered into the input field first . &quot;
&quot; with the second Selection field closing the editing window for text pass@@ codes , you can determine whether the text pass@@ book book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text pass@@ book book , the book is saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text password will not be saved . select Before S@@ aving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text@@ book is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the Wor@@ ter@@ ge@@ ese page contains a list of Dic@@ tion@@ aries for Wor@@ ds . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop down box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; using the buttons on the right side of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field . &quot;
&quot; for this source , select the language you want ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert just correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how these are to be weigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary without records . as &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically inserts into the dictionary , you can create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
the main section of the window for editing text pass@@ ag@@ ons is divided in two . in the upper part the text pass@@ a@@ gew@@ ays are represented as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the matching keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text@@ book , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; adding actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books can be reached either via the selection in the menu bar , toolbar or via a drop down menu . &quot;
you can change the order of text pass@@ ag@@ ons or text passages by drag@@ ging the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; alt ; button .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the default storage . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the default storage . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . the toolbar can be moved to another location by clicking on the left side and drag@@ ging the toolbar . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a narrow strip is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar for text pass@@ ag@@ ings is indicated with entries . by default , the toolbar can be moved directly under the toolbar . by clicking on the left side and drag@@ ging the toolbar can be moved to another location . &quot;
probably you have not entered the command for the voice output correctly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the card card voice output . ( see Settings dialog for speech Synthes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . )
&quot; the festival is a language edition system at the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows to use the festival free of charge and without any restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in / usr / local / festival . the command to voice output is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently it only supports the English pr@@ on@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to propag@@ ate without restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ aks . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be switched on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wav@@ ed@@ file so you need an additional program to break the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax gladly swal@@ lows the last character of the text so that an additional character needs to be added . the full command is therefore more complex than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA -@@ e / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written into one line . the option to send data as standard input must be switched on .
&quot; the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standard interface for voice @-@ overs . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems . &quot;
&quot; since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; to use successfully , you need a language generator ( and course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but this depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak to let text output through the machine . a list of already spoken sentences will be saved , which the user can always be rel@@ aun@@ ched again . &quot;
&quot; note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not include speech synthes@@ izer . on the computer , a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed . &quot;

a module for text editor &amp; makes ; with which a text file can be read completely or partially .
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database by &amp; k@@ de ; ( http : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ on ; in the k@@ de @-@ accessibility mail@@ ing@@ list . the developer can also be found at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ accessibility ) . &quot;
&quot; before you can use it , you need to install program speech schedul@@ er and set correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; for the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card board will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card map will be displayed in general . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS Synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as various male or female voices , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use it , since the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker . &quot;
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer drivers for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the map @-@ map speaker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card reader will appear . this will appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot;
all already established speakers appear in this list . the preferred speaker will appear in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not exist .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speaker in the list also determines its priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to make your changes to the running &amp; down ; system .
&quot; select a type of voice here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the map . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ r ; almost use . go back to the map menu in general and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , to allow the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ am ; use to make text read . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click the General tab in General to open this card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to enable the T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card is displayed , and you can set up text orders and read it . see . remove the mark , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , run &amp; kt@@ t ; next , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears again as soon as the pre@@ text is completed . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series you can start , pause , pause and res@@ ume text orders . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for an order . &quot;
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be applied on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the ticket orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab in General and check out voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . first check the text you want to read , and select the text in the main menu . after a short time the voice output should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; header lines and other invisible stamps are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kate ; the extended text editor from &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text previously read . then check the text you want to read , and select the text in the Main Menu . then select the text output . &quot;
&quot; this also works , if &amp; makes ; embedded in other applications , like &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Not@@ i@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , which informs you about the events you have set . you can read the text of this news also from &amp; down . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up various types of messages . for example , you can set up a message in which your nickname appears in an IR@@ C channel . with &amp; ct@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ not@@ i@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the menu Settings menu . here possible settings for K@@ not@@ i@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ x@@ ml , which is shipped to &amp; down ; is a good example . it removes the tags br and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since it can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ t ; . for normal work with &amp; down ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filters , text is edited before it is sent to the program speech discourse . they are useful for improving the pr@@ on@@ unciation to select a suitable language and speaker or to b@@ ypass certain defects of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differenti@@ ates four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and res@@ ists these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the requested orders are res@@ um@@ ed . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor becomes too hot . a warning has priority and holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders are res@@ um@@ ed after the output of the warning .
&quot; News are the next @-@ highest priority . a message breaks ordinary text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses news . while you can read &amp; eg ; a long text on a website , you can welcome with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . each order , which you can initiate from the card card , is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the edition of longer texts that have no special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four commis@@ sions are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of screen read@@ ings . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a file is read , this output is stopped and terminated . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
&quot; strings replace parts of a text by other text . the replaced parts can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is supplied with pre@@ defined string substitute filters , which allow the creation of chat @-@ em@@ oti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for format@@ ting messages from &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intelli@@ gible form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; -@@ conver@@ ters use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format .
&quot; with speaking selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text , or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; down ; for example , if you have sent a female voice on the card board speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e. read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , the text remains unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; message is sent to &amp; down ; it is processed by all filters activated on the page . the processing by the filter is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the further below setup di@@ alogs will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; to set up string substitute filters , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged against the corresponding substitute text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only has to be distinguished from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is executed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file to save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied when the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages when clicking the &amp; Ctr@@ l button at the mou@@ sec@@ lick . &quot;
&quot; here a value is entered , the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; you will get the application ID running programs with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ numbers you have to leave . if for example , the application ID cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter cop@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words , the string substitute filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . so the words must be limited by separ@@ ator ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls . &quot;
XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ers translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such trans@@ formations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system .
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient . &quot;
&quot; with the speaker selection filter , you can send text to a specific speaker that is set up on the card board , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that text by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before leaving a text to the filter , it searches for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker features that the program pres@@ ets , that sends the text to &amp; kt@@ on ; sends , and the characteristics of the speaker established on the card board . the speaker selection filter will be able to over@@ write the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; if the text is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for example , you can access it by clicking on the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; if the text comp@@ lies with the filter conditions above , the speaker will be selected to meet the desired requirements . click the button on the right to display the dialog selection dialog . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your intercom settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter is applied only to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ ese Filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; the Voice Output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD Module API , with the speech synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can use . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of the language output API by &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( http : / / accessi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output lists via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d to the object K@@ Speech .
&quot; text of text to read and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you give
&quot; open two &amp; console ; -@@ window . first start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; conversion filter , but when using the module for festival web sites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone , so SA@@ BLE doesn &apos;t work at all . &quot;
&quot; certain signs or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sets are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ew@@ ed . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , ensure that the option character encoding is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be corrected by a string substitute filter . see . &quot;

speech Synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; Dic@@ t have their own license which you can find in the associated documentation or on the relevant websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package with &amp; ct@@ ts ; you can also download the source code from ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;
&quot; contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project site http : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es@@ .html . &quot;
&quot; American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio . &quot;
&quot; K@@ T@@ TS works with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a console . &quot;
&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or outdated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; to use another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team . &quot;
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used to support SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
&quot; to compile it , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source text archive for k@@ de@@ cks , or have downloaded all the night currently created , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you are using the script , first check if speech dispens@@ er works properly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ am ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed so that the device scrip@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be further developed and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text is divided into individual sentences . the user can re@@ vert sentence or set @-@ up , repeat or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; if an application sends text to &amp; out ; if you have a speech , you can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have established a speaker whose language is English and whose sex is female , it will be used automatically to the best matching speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker sel@@ ects , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the Map tab to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card reader will be displayed . as an example , the layout of the Module for Festival Interactive is shown below . details of the modules can be found here . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in PAT@@ H , you must enter only festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character encoding for text that is passed to festival . in case of voices , which are known , this setting will be made automatically . in general , Western languages use ISO 8859 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak apply ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these slider you set volume , speaking speed , and pitch of the synthes@@ ized language . if you cannot select some controls and show them gray , the voice you choose does not allow these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded when starting K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set is synthes@@ ized faster ( with greater memory consumption ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forgot to click App@@ ly ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start only the icon kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD pre@@ reads a text . thus you have the option to stop reading or otherwise control . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the actual status of the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the straight set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card board speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can proceed or rec@@ ede in the order that is selected from the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with one click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here , only text orders are listed and managed . issues of screen read@@ ings , war@@ nings and messages are not displayed . further information about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select the kind of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or working ; can &apos;t load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are shown in the list , you need to install at least one module . have you selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; set the microphone speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds roughly half and 200 % about the double normal microphone speed . in order to be able to implement these settings , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the running &amp; t@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in doubt choose standard .
&quot; on this map , you can set up special promotions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . after the output of the screen reader is read , the requested orders are res@@ um@@ ed . &quot;
warning will be the next priority . this stage is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor becomes too hot . a warning will keep the output of messages and normal text . these orders are res@@ um@@ ed after reading the warning .
&quot; News is the next priority . a message breaks ordinary text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you have just read a long text on a website , you can still welcome someone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queu@@ e . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both lead sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this map menu apply only for normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and the spending of screen readers there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; ct@@ ts ; to read K@@ not@@ i@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click Not@@ i@@ fications . the card card noti@@ fications will appear . &quot;
&quot; select this check box to switch off &amp; k@@ de ; disable noti@@ fications . if this setting is not checked , the remaining settings are disabled and working ; reads no noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; this setting marks , will be al@@ erts when a sound is played , by &amp; out ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog will appear where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event will read the message , the &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone in an IR@@ C message men@@ tions your nickname . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list nothing else is stated , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ t ; ignored . &quot;
use this sel@@ ector to specify what &apos;s to do ; do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected user defined text , enter the required text . you can use the following wild@@ cards : &quot;
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . default sel@@ ects the speaker that will appear in the list on the card reader as the top entry . see also .
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it is executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can set the following noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . the loaded events are merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All Not@@ i@@ fications are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices , speech velocity , volume , gender of voice and pitch . &quot;
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the default voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and punc@@ tu@@ ation filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . this allows &amp; ct@@ ts ; faster to start reading , as only the first set has to be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order . thus , you can also start or stop or stop orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not directly support this . &quot;
&quot; at the first start of &amp; down , a set limit filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add further set limits filters , but beginners are advised . &quot;
&quot; on the simpl@@ est way , you will learn how to set up the speaker selection by trying out . switch off the speaker selection and enter text to read . if you select the speaker &apos;s menu , check out some features and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . you must of course have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last for a long time &quot;
&quot; you can then stop or cancel text orders on the card map , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal set limit filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only be removed . do not change anything at that filter unless you know what you do . &quot;
reference Rec@@ ogni@@ tion Fil@@ ters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ positions and add a tab@@ ular sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ators are automatically removed from the text before fil@@ ming ) . note that the standard rules limit filter will retain the character set .
&quot; S@@ BD filters will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ bits ) , war@@ nings , messages , or output of Screen Re@@ aders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal set limit filter , you can insert it again by downloading the default _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ on . &quot;
&quot; on the map menu Speech selection , you can over@@ write the intercom settings for the application . &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card card speaker ) . in other words : there are no subscri@@ ber features .
&quot; using the matching speaker that displays all the features of a set @-@ up speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select the speaker . otherwise cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that most likely corresponds to the originally set properties . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this property doesn &apos;t play a role , do not enter anything . &quot;
select this check box if the property should have priority over other features . you can also set multiple mark@@ ers here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is before , if you know that a certain application text is sent in another language than the one in the work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; to use all the properties in the field of or@@ ator , who is most likely to delete the following , click on the standard speaker selection button and then use speaker that matches the following . &quot;
in this case 0 is for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input is 0 required ) .

&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and crashed . probably you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved , you may need a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I stop a text order , fre@@ eze &amp; kt@@ t ; a . on the &amp; console ; a message appears : un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem is that conflicts occur in AL@@ SA , which prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot;
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / f@@ estival@@ int / voices , add the new voice . &quot;
&quot; on the audio board audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program has to be installed so@@ x and can be found on the environment variable PAT@@ H . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed themselves on the map card for intercom devices . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speaking speed are ignored , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre@@ reads . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML ; ( see ) or if you are very cour@@ age@@ ous , change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML converter filter , and set up the microphone speed . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have arranged a female Festival spokes@@ man but &amp; kt@@ t ; reads the websites with a male voice .
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day SA@@ BLE GEN@@ DER does not appear to function . thus the festival does not produce any mistakes , the x@@ s@@ l file for converting SS@@ ML will be the GEN@@ DER tag . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a separate character set filter and now I can move in &amp; out ; no more set @-@ up or go back . on the tab , orders are displayed , the job consists only of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , call@@ sign , comm@@ a , and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) may not filter you . instead , use a filter for set limits . &quot;
al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . al@@ sa is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer is available in version 0.@@ 8.7 or later . note : make sure that the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer by calling before using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ r . ( http : / / g@@ stream@@ er.@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org )
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio output . if your system is also included , you can &apos;t simultaneously play music and start reading a text . &amp; t@@ ts ; also fre@@ eze when you start a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; out , the current sentence is still read . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for general setting of the speaking speed , but is not mandatory otherwise . Debian users can install so@@ x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . the program is already included in most &amp; Linux ; CDs . &quot;
&quot; have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ am ; as a tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , log in as a normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a matching folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least created on request .
the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a running time dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the Debian distribution policies ) .
&quot; in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 installed . if this folder is not specified in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination option . for example &quot;

&quot; before you are using the synthes@@ izer , first check if your speech synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is well laid out . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . for many voices , you can adjust volume , speech speed , and pitch . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions provided with the Festival . if you &apos;d like to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / voices / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . select a Cyr@@ il@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech language , the code must be set to ISO 8859 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option code must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cyr@@ il@@ lic , like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then the festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone .
&quot; in this procedure , additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the festival / lib / . instructions can be found at &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German festival is a new version of the festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . it is necessary to install festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , install festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival &quot;
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file in the package you downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , inser@@ ting the error correction files is not required , you only need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;
&quot; ( voice @-@ location &quot; german _ de@@ 1 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; German Male , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; German Female , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; on some systems you have to edit the file / etc / f@@ estival@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices do not work with I@@ MS German festival . &quot;
&quot; this method uses special code to give the language of a festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; first , grab and install the festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure that both work . then download Festival @-@ Czech from &quot;
un@@ pack the program with tar into a matching folder and create the enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file festival must be in your PAT@@ H .
download the map file cz@@ 2 from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ page and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip into the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder .

&quot; Festival Lite is a free , lively speech synthes@@ izer that currently supports a limited number of voices and languages . &quot;
Fl@@ ite is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . find Fl@@ ite first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; H@@ adi@@ fix is a two @-@ stage speech synthes@@ izer which works with di@@ ph@@ oning . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text into Di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; speech synthes@@ izer generates the sound . the language quality is good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages . you can set voice , pitch , speech speed and volume over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . &quot;
download at least one German language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA page and un@@ zip it to the / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA folder .
&quot; copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ phor@@ c to ~ / .t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ phor@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ ename . &quot;
select a voice and set the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correctly .
&quot; EP@@ OS is a free , lively speech Synthes@@ izer for Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple speech Synthes@@ izer with even adequate voice quality . with &amp; down ; you can only adjust the volume with this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; when the EP@@ OS programs are not in your PAT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the map menu . if the EP@@ OS programs are not in your PAT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the map menu . if the EP@@ OS programs are not in your PAT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the map . enter in a console ; epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ p speech synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java , i.e. you need to install Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; neither pitch , volume or speech speed can be set . &quot;
&quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; t@@ ts ; with any speech synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in a console . &quot;
best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device
&quot; this manual explains the installation and usage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows administration of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selection from K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create for the user a simple interface for the following tasks :
&quot; after the installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured already , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and allows setting of network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adaptation of the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings module is loaded when the option is selected network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index . when starting the module network settings , this one tries to detect the used platform on the system automatically . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the release version is best suited . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in the system administration mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be considered , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can access the system administration mode at the right bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three sem@@ esters : &quot;
the tab network interfaces will be used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices will be displayed . from the tab network interfaces the following tasks can be performed :
the settings displayed for network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button ... in the dialog box set up .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button Advanced Settings displays the dialog with advanced options . &quot;
&quot; in automatic mode TCP / IP settings are carried out from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are required for the system at the same time with the start of system services . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of manual , the TCP / IP address must be set without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the required TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as the properties of the device in the list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; con@@ sole , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
network devices can be activated or switched off on demand . switching off a disabled network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on interface .
network devices can be activated or switched off on demand . switch off an activated network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on interface ...
establishes the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net that convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name with the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine asks http : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will resolve this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the name resolution part of the name resolution allows you to easily manage this list . entries can be added , removed or altered . DNS entries can be group@@ ed by selecting an entry and ascending or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons Hin@@ auf or Her@@ under in priority . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group PC to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . the new nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog will be displayed . &quot;
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will be inserted in the list .
&quot; from the group computer to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button ... Edit dialog will display . &quot;
&quot; the name of name @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes host @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting when no DNS server is available . in small , remote networks it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list contains name @-@ known hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses will support . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add ... The New Ali@@ as dialog is displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the well known computer has several alias names , press de button add several times and enter the other alias name . &quot;
select an entry of a name known from the list and select Edit ... Edit Cont@@ ex@@ ed Calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK button will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is http : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installing the binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download and install the rpm package and install at rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool with graphical user interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages with libraries and other things are needed . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to compile the following commands . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology is given , in the second , all configuration files are discussed . &quot;
this section cannot replace further information about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information on the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is convey@@ ed .
IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found a wide spread . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is currently concentr@@ ating on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address of a network interface is attribut@@ able to . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; work@@ station is the network administrator to address a valid IP address or if available , the IP address can not be chosen as desired ! &quot;
&quot; when placing your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , so their arbitrary usage is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the area of 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 hosts . &quot;
&quot; additionally the net@@ mask is set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP forwarding . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 has its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that operates like a closed circle . &quot;
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
&quot; this file is sometimes dynamically changed in case of DSL connections , so that it is not surprised if there is another content found there in case of active DSL connections . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is handled acci@@ dentally by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . a different stand than expected can therefore occur .

&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first one was to create a surface for tar , which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective packing . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take when one sec@@ ures ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it needs to be bound by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; return the band back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t recognize the band on the band , you &apos;ll be asked if the band should be form@@ atted . &quot;
&quot; det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the preview , search for the matching index on your disk . if this cannot be found , you &apos;ll be asked if the band index should be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched through the entry of the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; can be seen by changing the symbol for the tape , that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be form@@ atted by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; a band@@ age must be form@@ atted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to the format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drive is form@@ atted before use , it must happen before you form@@ atted a tape before using . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually do not require format@@ ting the tape , DAT drives do not require format@@ ting . &quot;
after entering the band name and the capacity drive &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the tape . all data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select Save ...
&quot; once the backup is started , the dialog opens for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files again and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; the dialog will display the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives for the drive . only the selected file or folder is checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the record for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu entry Check ....
&quot; once the scan has been started , the dialog will display settings for checking . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the working folder for checking . &quot;
the dialog will display the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
&quot; before initi@@ ating the restore , the files that are to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the files and / or sub@@ folders are restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore from the menu .
&quot; once the restore process has been started , the dialog will appear to restore . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the working folder for recovery . &quot;
this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to re @-@ create the band index file using the tape content . this process delet@@ es all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index in two ways of the tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the currently selected folder .
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , it is true that only the files located in the same file system are stored in the same file system as the folder . folders that are located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be included separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the other files . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delet@@ es the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; and lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings via the K@@ D@@ at menu item ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the band device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command mt load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; to block the ej@@ ection during the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , the attachment will be dis@@ car@@ ded ; automatically dis@@ car@@ ded the tape . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy @-@ streaming . &quot;
&quot; the option turned on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ der block size for the tape drive to change . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you have to communicate the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is form@@ atted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where the name of the system is the full name of the system on which the tape was form@@ atted . seconds is the number of seconds past in which the tape was form@@ atted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
&quot; the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is integrated .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system can get information about your system , or where the system provides access to information about problems that occur on your server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system , or where the system is stored in the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system log ; experienced users access the quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system log ; therefore , attempts to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and analysed . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system log ; functions are available , with whose help the single log lines of a log file can easily filter and sort . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , &amp; k@@ system log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - to open . will not show you this , and it opens instead of having a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system log ; most likely not have permission to read the log files under Linux . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or according to entered string . in default , the list of log lines will be displayed automatically , so that only the log lines will be displayed in addition to the filter . in the default setting , a log line will only be displayed if in one of the columns contain the string of the filter search term . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can select a different entry at this point . for example , select the column process only with entries in the log file system . for example , select a process in the log file system log , and in the fil@@ ter@@ bar indicate the name of a process , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log lines that were sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . log lines of level error are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color as log lines of the stage critic . the colored representation of minutes lines can be shut down in the Setup dialog .
&quot; if you want to show only a certain process ( for example , in the system log or the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case you can use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can ski@@ p the option to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new log lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system log ; allows you to view multiple protocol files in separate windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at http : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softw@@ are@@ .@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more recent information on the source sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the Fol@@ der &amp; k@@ de folder ; -@@ Subversion @-@ Archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; system V In@@ it editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system quickly became the standard for controlling the program starts when the system runs in the &amp; Linux ; world . and , for this reason , because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD int@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further on historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because perhaps someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without a re@@ installation and re @-@ format@@ ting . therefore you must ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
&quot; init@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service you want to start the system or switch to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things like network , NFS , &amp; send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things like set@@ serial , which will only be started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel search in@@ it at various points and starts the first one that it finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / init@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can manually edit / etc / init@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have a little confused , then you can fix it by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and exec@@ uting the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init@@ .@@ d directory .
how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line :
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script is called with the argument stop . if it includes an S , the script is called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server run@@ level that only runs htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; using a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not tell tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it ( or stop ) .
you can also shift scripts between run@@ level@@ ds or change the position within a level by drag@@ ging it somewhere else . this will only happen if they pull out an entry from the range of available system services .
&quot; note : entries are moved if you move them into a new area . to just copy them to a new Run@@ time , you must explicitly copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and add to the target range -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the custo@@ dial numbers of the entries before you can again try to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , there is no way to restore items thrown into the rec@@ ycle bin . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab key to activate the different fields of work ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use Ctr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with Ctr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to manually change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the Enter key to open the properties dialog . use the Tab key to change the properties dialog . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of loss of data , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre @-@ settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be recovered from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise they will be stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ ing , and now the machine starts constantly . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the file / etc / init@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; available for running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only present in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for proprietary programming programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not comply with any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v are planning an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using a different distribution , please check that all configuration files are available which are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply without message when their configuration files are not available or set up correctly . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ tier varies from distribution to distribution , can even vary from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation relates to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapter adjustment of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to save it . either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the saving entry in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , user and user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled space limitations ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created where you can customize individual settings . other flash@@ cards appear , if shadow -@@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Unix . &quot;
&quot; the password management map appears , if Shadow -@@ Pass@@ words or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD systems . &quot;
&quot; this card @-@ card only appears if for at least one built @-@ in fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( identi@@ fiable at the file system quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , whereby the space restrictions are given in KB : &quot;
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected using the File System field with space limitation
&quot; the map menu provides information about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group to which the user belongs , can be found in the Fiel@@ ds group . furthermore , the user can be member in other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the Properties dialog contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the matching button of the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works analogue . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO Boot@@ Manager , add , remove and modify the boot password , add time to boot of the standard operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
