<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions over the serial port are slow, this connection is outdated. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 has to have been created with libexif support to read the thumbnails of digiKam reliably. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may not see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at & digikam; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much simpler, and digitised; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in & digitised; themselves perform."</seg>

<seg id="84">"the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, the filtering on the filename is displayed only if this ind is displayed on the symbol view. which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the AlbenSettings."</seg>
<seg id="85">"view & quot; My Albenlistquot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by and digitised are stored in a single album room. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were recorded on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the AlbenProperties or after the date the album was created first. the date can be changed in the properties of the album."</seg>
<seg id="86">"if you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album."</seg>
<seg id="87">"to copy or move a picture from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop it there. in the pop-up menu you can select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. you can also move or copy several photos in the same way. simply select all photos and move it to the target album."</seg>

<seg id="94">An album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">The collection includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">"the image window gives you the main preview of your photos. if you select an album, all pictures in this album are displayed in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can customize the size of this preview with the two loupe buttons in the toolbar."</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is the colors that come from your camera or scanner to have a predictable departure from the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are equal to those of your camera or scanner and the colors you print or publish in your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">"if the theme is on colour management, everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants. in addition, you should provide information with deeper information on each point of the image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide you with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you can get the desired results."</seg>
<seg id="379">"if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management."</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image editions are by e-mail or the web where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">"so if sRGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy, why should you use another color space and have to worry about color blinkage?"</seg>
<seg id="383">"a visual example of sRGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region."</seg>
<seg id="384">"if you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger colour spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent page and then click info and then information About RGB Working Spaces."</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to calibrate my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">"yes! whether you are working in the sRGB colour space or not, you need to calmer your monitor, since sRGB works out that your; onitor is colallied from sRGB. the soundproofing of your monitor closes the circle. if you are working as the sRGB colour space, you must either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, use an appropriate monitor profile or both."</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore use it before you attempt to manual manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions Normalize, Compare, Automatic balancing and contrast extend from the menu Correction Automatic correction try automatically to make the best of your colors. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminous levels over the whole picture so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">"like this: this method adjusts the brightness channel of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. this results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation which causes either miracles in a picture or it destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatically compensate: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it calculates the dark and bright boundary-tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete Histogrammes area."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the widest possible area and a re-mapping of all values in between. this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The White Balance from & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is somewhat limited because of a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in the rough mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"thumbnails can be adjusted in size. on the left side, both the original image and the preview of the target image are adapted. if you want to see the original white balance, then click on the sub-window."</seg>
<seg id="398">The thumbnail preview features a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"in the upper right corner a histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lighted images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with one button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. shade adjustment lets you improve the blade details of your photos or also dim down."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play Anstat with the controls above, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is exposed. you will see the combined result in the white balance. this is indicated in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and load exactly this. any adjustment of the white balance you have set can save you into a text file and then load again later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button resets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will give a different photo than your original. if you save this your original image is changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can set the coding depth for each color channel of the edited image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. this coding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF, and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour tonmapping can be performed by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for using color profiles can be used to rate the chapter of Color administration.</seg>
<seg id="408">This tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and allow you to adjust your settings so that you can use them for multiple photos at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always have the same error and you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the digitised; tool color effects provides you four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canister filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, solar-ization, also called Sabatier, was an effect. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photo paper from the extra light. this was the effect that the lighter areas were dark and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar radiation. with approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible."</seg>
<seg id="413">"this is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1), and it processes the (2). the intensity applied is 30%."</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter simulates the so called & quot; Velviaquot; Effect. it differs from a saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simply, it embelts many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film produced by Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvias strongly saturated colors are also a couple of photographists especially those the hardly landscapes established too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeats the strength of the neon light. in case of large images the filter can load the entire CPU for one moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to change the color contrast and the luminosity of the photo. you can experiment to view the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors. you can experiment to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjusting can be considered in preview. once you are satisfied with the result use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you can make a photo of poor lighting conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too big saturation. in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool is based on tone correction for improving exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you will need only the area of the slider for the purpose mentioned here. concrete the three sliders below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graph three sliders are clicked into the picture and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the control is to postpone the controls and to make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"the preview is dynamically, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left side are the following options available."</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it is possible to set whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the bottom for the medium tones, often called Gammageddon."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color brush pettes can be used in preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, middle and bright tones automatically. in addition, there is one button for fully automatic adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. the compression of the output values can be used for example to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">"automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set according to the intensity values of the image."</seg>
<seg id="428">"save as and load: with these buttons, the set values in the filesystem can be saved and loaded later. to do so, the Gimp level format is used."</seg>
<seg id="429">"if you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on preview the original image to set the output values for red, green, blue and the luminance channels."</seg>
<seg id="430">"the option overexposure indicators controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result."</seg>
<seg id="431">"below is an example of the input values for the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and Alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image (2)."</seg>
<seg id="432">"on the left hand side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview is dynamically adjusted depending on your settings. on the right-hand side, the following options are available:"</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">"in addition to this box, there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images associated with a digital camera, linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode helps to continue."</seg>
<seg id="435">"for example, if you move a short part to the right, for example, the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the corresponding pixel is darker."</seg>
<seg id="436">"when you move this marker to the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste."</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve that you created can be saved in the filesystem and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>

<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other fields.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but especially in dark areas, grained pictures."</seg>
<seg id="481">"the sharpness mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture of sharper appearance. actually, it does not work a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus as well as most digital images need a correction of the sharpness. this is because of the digitization process colors with only minimal differences to a color dot. this, in turn, means that sharp edges are somewhat blur. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">Images in the original format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners have a sharpening filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable it, you get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. you can use the menu entry Correction Follow.</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, you should deal with caution because the results do not work very naturally: the sharpening increases sharpness of edges, but intensifies the noise. in general, you can refocus the sharpness of an image. in general, you will find further information and a comparison of all the techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much simpler than it to sharpen. use the tool to soften with the menu entry Correction softwae and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred is a very good tool for removing veil from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview can help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter. high resolution images allow larger radii. therefore you should best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount is the percentage between the original and the caught image, which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharpening and therefore avoid fairness in faces, skies and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurry mask. the original image is the (1) and the image processed (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">Das & digikam; tool refocus refocused a picture by enhancing the sharpness. it used the copyrighted Entfission Filter algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß'sche folding. the Gauß'sche folding has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also from the source pixelines removed far from original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Viennese inverse of the Gauß's folding is even very strongly affected by the removed pixels. it causes undesired results."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should be 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0.03. a high value will still further contaminate the image."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter when your sharpness Gauß is. in most cases, you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value non-zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix Size: this value determines the size of the matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circle-shaped sharpness or the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocus parameter that you have set is saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all cuts, color and intensity correction before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, blurred masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by blurred masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically speaking, blurry masks always have to produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the blur. for the Viennese filter, one can show that it is the optimal linear filter. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original non-sharp color image has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods for focal correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator smoothes the sharpness of the realm that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the ink tinplate permits a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool Error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The painting-painting was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as Starpoints to simplify the restoration. the available preferences are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings fine you can use the Rider smoothing and Advanced Settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the picture. a value of 0.9 should keep details so that no sharpening is subsequently required. please note that the level of detail should always be subordinated to the direction dependency."</seg>
<seg id="520">"direction dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a movie line or CCD, a high value wave-like pattern is created. JPEG Artefakte will best be removed at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value suitable to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it has to be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: specify how often the algorithm is going through. usually enough is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-increment da [5, 90]: angular-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is small, it should also be small."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"linear interpolation: the More of quality you get by selecting this option is only minor, but it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to let it out."</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and load exactly this. correct any adjustment of image errors can be saved into a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however it can take a long time and load a high CPU load. therefore you can cancel the calculation anytime with the button Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove image errors with small artefacts. the module is used on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artefact in the foreground that due to a bad film storage caused during the journey. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digitised; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial."</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot at the top shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">"in the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindows details and the Advanced Settings window will remain in the default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius checks the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the amount of the filter per pixel and allows the image to be blurred. the area indicated by the radius turns over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller errors are adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the depth of sharpness. this value sets the pixel distance that the filter looks forward to determine brightness changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication can occur again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong you can not remove all the noise or noise tips. place it on a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak roud or JPEG Artefakte without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either color or luminance to change to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the Gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerances of the darker areas, which are typically stronger and smoother. however, it also spends the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"attenuation: controls the alignment of the phase attenuation. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filtering radius reacts on variations of luminance. if it is elevated, noise and phase jitter appear on the edges. it can remove noise points and is the recommended method for it."</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for noise reduction that you have set can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied to the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use tool to sharpen the image with the menu entry Correction softwae and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The digitised; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, movie granularity, scratches, compression artefacts and local defects that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the same algorithm can be used for color and texture setting. the texturing composition is performed with another tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefakte reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect in some areas even very far from it. as a lossless compression algorithm it generates some compression & quot; artefact quot; - small standards that are in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and load exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">"photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish."</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can be restored like a photo with uniformly noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (tm) 700si camera is recorded on an Ilford (tm) 700si camera on an Ilford (tm) 700si camera on an Ilford (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. the original image is below (1) and the corrected one (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time textures were reduced to an old color photo created using a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were created by scanner lighting and photo paper. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">"die & digikam; tool Hotpixel allows you to remove hotpixels of photos with a CCD camera, eight were removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp."</seg>

<seg id="559">The image area and preview can help you correct the result within the picture. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the faulty pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixels. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">"average: an average of the neighbor pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line."</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from pixel are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2 dim) or a group of linear curves (1 dim). these are then used to interpolate the faulty pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">"square: this is the default filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2 dim) or a group of square bends (1 dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block."</seg>
<seg id="564">"cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic area (2 dim) or a group of cubic curves (1 dim), which is then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block."</seg>

<seg id="566">"the digitification correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image."</seg>
<seg id="567">"wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not light the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there."</seg>
<seg id="568">"many Center Filters need a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which may be used to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise disharpensive effects are caused by movement."</seg>
<seg id="569">"using the large exposing area of today's film and colour and grayscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that was done without this filter. the Vignettierungscorrection tool is protected by John Walker."</seg>
<seg id="570">"with three controllers, you can control the Vignettierungscorrection filter and with three further exposure of the target image."</seg>
<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the degree of amplification at the point of the largest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or by chance of a luminous intensity of 2, to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree."</seg>
<seg id="572">"luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image using the Vignetting correction reduces the brightness of pixels. you only need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options."</seg>
<seg id="573">"if you want to re-adjust the exposure of the target image, leave the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digikam; image processing from the color gradation menu."</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of Vignettide correction applied to an image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a rejecting and contrast correction was also performed with the image using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digitised; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. color distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second grade treats the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>

<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scales the image size and results in a correction of first grades. negative values magnify while positive the image is smaller.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">"to help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values for the next start."</seg>

<seg id="650">"harmonious triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-level rule, harmonic triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles on the diagonals."</seg>
<seg id="651">"Golden Middle: the golden center is a division that on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the petals of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, who used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects used the golden division in all times when you put your images, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>

<seg id="654">The golden center provides liqueer guides when you put a picture together. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the Golden Spirals will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third-level rule, the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow."</seg>

<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray follows a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the specified threshold, both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you adjust the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually followed and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion allows you to adjust the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another possibility to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you switch jittering, changed & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setting for the quality of the rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>

<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the CD; Title to the keyword (English: tag) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt from lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the FreeDB is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs and enter the information instead of themselves into the computer. it is to be noted that all the others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer. it is to be noted that all the others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer. it is to be noted that here is only spoken by text: & CD; Title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal but I (note of the Uebersetzer: this is the author) am not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be inflicted."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in this type of configuration, it seems, the e-mail address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only be the programmer who has checked the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator is created to use FreeDB, the geographical closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"a visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which program is used to store pieces from CD & CD; to store in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more exactly, search in the source code... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. please note that the cdparanoia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first, if this is not yet done."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"for saving the read WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. in the first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab for setting up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for predefined encoders. further information about the encoder is located in the chapter Welcher Kodiver.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a encoder, you can receive more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console)."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"you can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, writing and reading real on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoder of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy protected audio CD; check out the cover of the CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">"there is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, you can give tips on how to proceed."</seg>

<seg id="1544">"in this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and use our first & CD; we'll use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keyword (tags)."</seg>
<seg id="1545">"there must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. an appropriate package for lame can be found, for example, with a search engine since it is considered as not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can of course always do."</seg>

<seg id="1661">This topic describes how the patches of General MIDI can be displayed on your specific keyboard. the general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equation sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and also leave no line for any of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to place any sound that this instrument needs to play on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun shot. to do so, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if now a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (Win), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here is meant with the term drum patch of the patch, where each note represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards have)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KeyMaP section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with PATCHMAP, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used above all to map sound on the percussions channel. see the keymaps included.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and the second channel, do this in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for Keyboards, which have percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will always be used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio indicates, in which ratio pitch-calendar events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-calendar event with the value n, this will be converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file there are no decimal commas."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM gives the fact that a keyboard, which is a pitch-Bender event will play with the value 4096, a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards attempt to play two tones up to one octave above. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid; try around."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI settings dialog."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos you can see which sounds are played.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why so & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I've written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me showed only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later a lot of other useful functions were added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparative window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful when two persons work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes at the same time. the original file (the base) helps resolving conflicts and simultaneously displays the result. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and denies the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check code, you will like this feature."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visibly. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more annoyance if somebody changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by completing only the filename of the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diff3 Folder 1 Folder 2 kdiff3 Folder 1 Folder 2 -o destination folder kdiff3 Folder 3 kdiff3 Folder 3 kdiff3 folder 1 folder 3 -o destination folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">"opening dialog will allow the manual typing of file names, the selection via the file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"in the folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the compare or merging of folders will be introduced. if for A a file is selected, for B and C, a folder, then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"if merging is enabled, the input field is active and can be processed. however, it is not necessary to immediately set a output file. you can also do this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drop: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"which thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out how much these functions are, this would be a relatively large effort. you would need to create two corresponding files, they are in & kdiff3; load them and then compare them. now, you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"note: currently, you can't draw anything out of & kdiff3; only the drop of text into a comparison window is supported."</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dropping text into another program than cutting and inserting (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, allow the mouse to rest a while above the line. then, a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)"</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three spring windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)"</seg>
<seg id="2305">The color scheme is particularly useful when comparing both files is the default color for red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. this is in the next section (merging) good to see.</seg>
<seg id="2306">"when differences were found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages, the color is displayed. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (with C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant for the preprocessor and in a few, rare cases.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line, which separates the abstraction column from the text, is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line break is activated, the line is displayed on dashed lines."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the results window (under the comparison patterns) also has an info line with the inscription Edition:, the filename and [change] when you have edited the result. usually it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts."</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved is the saving downlighted!!! (use the buttons Springe to the next solved / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">"if only two compare windows are used, each difference is also a conflict that must be manually resolved."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows the group will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also be a jump of the position in the windows, where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each left appears a black bar."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"this is only a placeholder for the case that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source. this is just a placeholder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source again. this text is not displayed in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you might copy and paste somewhere else."</seg>

<seg id="2314">"note: if selecting the sources ignore the options numbers or ignore Ignatiere C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"navigating is mainly used with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click on one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, runter, side, beginning, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-end, as you can also use it from other programs."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"in the output window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the Insertion button, you can switch between insertion and write mode. (default is the insertion mode.)"</seg>
<seg id="2317">"one click with left mouse button in one of the summaries columns synchronizes the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group (as already in the assembly section, and the editing window has been explained)."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Strg-down / Strg-Up), to the next / previous conflict (Strg-picture upward / Strg-picture downwards) or to the next / previous conflict (Strg-picture upward / Strg-picture downwards) or to the next / previous unsolved conflict. therefore, between solutes and unsolved conflicts must be distinguished."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"to copy the marker into the clipboard, you need to copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl Insert). however, if this is checked, whatever you select, will automatically copy into the clipboard and copy the manual copy. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard."</seg>
<seg id="2320">"line ends are saved according to the operating system underlying operating system. Unix variants use a line feed\, and Win32-based systems use cart return + newline feed\\ r\. Kdiffusion retains the line-ending of source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not use binaries."</seg>

<seg id="2335">"automatically resolves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source. (default is manual selection.)

<seg id="2342">"if you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding to be used to save."</seg>
<seg id="2343">"if you define pre-processor commands, you may not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processor command can only be used with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of the pre-processor command."</seg>

<seg id="2349">"when reading a file, it will first pass to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your requirements. you can use this function e.g. for cutting-out disruptive parts or to correct the indentation."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"when reading a file, it is first given to this external command. if a normal pre-processor command is specified (see above), the output of the command is only used for line adjustment. you can write your own preprocessor that corresponds exactly to your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting the diff-results. however, an external program is required and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is sufficient."</seg>

<seg id="2354">"while you experimenting with sed, you may start understanding it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"the ignoring of numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiffusion. but it is good as an example of a further processing command for line adjustment. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, thus virtually eliminated."</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements of each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">"instead of sed you can also use something different like perl -p -e's / regexp / replace / SCHALTER 'However, perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for viewing and merging. the further operations only change the data that the newline algorythmus can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"note: in rare cases when you use a normal preprocessor, the line-like preprocessor sees the output of the normal Preprocessor as input."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"the preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data."</seg>

<seg id="2622">"to understand the functioning of filters, it is important to know how the program" "speech-dispatcher" "works with a text. & ktts; differentiates four types of texts."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"the output of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and resists these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the requested orders are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this stage is important messages such as & eg; processor becomes too hot. a warning has priority and holds the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after the output of the warning.</seg>

<seg id="2626">"the rest are simple text orders. each order, which you can initiate from the card card, is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the edition of longer texts that have no special urgency."</seg>
<seg id="2627">"all four commissions are processed in queues, except for the output of screen readings. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just such a file is read, this output is stopped and terminated."</seg>
<seg id="2628">"first you need to know that filters never be applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">"strings replace parts of a text by other text. the replaced parts can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; is supplied with predefined string substitute filters, which allow the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for formatting messages from & konversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form."</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -converters use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format.</seg>

Siehe. read about it."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"each of these filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied to a voice output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, the text remains unchanged to the next filter."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"if a text order, message, warning or a & kde; message is sent to & down; it is processed by all filters activated on the page. the processing by the filter is done in the order in the list from top to bottom."</seg>

<seg id="2898">"before ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:"</seg>
<seg id="2899">"& kdat; can be seen by changing the symbol for the tape, that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without danger."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"before a tape can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"a bandage must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not correspond to the formatting at & kdat;. if your tape drive is formatted before use, it must happen before you formatted a tape before using. floppy disk drives usually do not require formatting the tape, DAT drives do not require formatting."</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to re-create the band index file using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this volume. you can create the index in two ways of the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the currently selected folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"for all folders listed under backup files, it is true that only the files located in the same file system are stored in the same file system as the folder. folders that are located on other filesystems can be included separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent of the other files."</seg>

<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>

<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings via the KDat menu item... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the band device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">"this setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is integrated, the command mt load to the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed."</seg>
<seg id="2932">"the option is switched on, tried & kdat; to block the ejection during the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives."</seg>
<seg id="2933">"if the option is turned on, the attachment will be discarded; automatically discarded the tape. do not use this option for floppy-streaming."</seg>
<seg id="2934">"the option turned on, tries & kdat; the hardwarder block size for the tape drive to change. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you have to communicate the block size for your tape drive."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"if & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only cover a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2936">"the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where the name of the system is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds past in which the tape was formatted."</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups."</seg>

<seg id="2940">"& ksystemlog; is a & kde; -viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system can get information about your system, or where the system provides access to information about problems that occur on your server."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"& ksystem log; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system, or where the system is stored in the different protocol files."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"in addition, & ksystem log; experienced users access the quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystem log; therefore, attempts to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and analysed."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you see in the following screenshot, & ksystem log; functions are available, with whose help the single log lines of a log file can easily filter and sort. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start, & ksystem log; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - to open. will not show you this, and it opens instead of having a small message window, so you have & ksystem log; most likely not have permission to read the log files under Linux."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or according to entered string. in default, the list of log lines will be displayed automatically, so that only the log lines will be displayed in addition to the filter. in the default setting, a log line will only be displayed if in one of the columns contain the string of the filter search term."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"of course, you can select a different entry at this point. for example, select the column process only with entries in the log file system. for example, select a process in the log file system log, and in the filterbar indicate the name of a process, so show you & ksystemlog; all log lines that were sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. log lines of level error are displayed with a more conspicuous color as log lines of the stage critic. the colored representation of minutes lines can be shut down in the Setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to show only a certain process (for example, in the system log or the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case you can use filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can skip the option to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new log lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystem log; allows you to view multiple protocol files in separate windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website at http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more recent information on the source sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you can also find in the Folder & kde folder; -Subversion-Archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; system V Init editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the V Init system quickly became the standard for controlling the program starts when the system runs in the & Linux; world. and, for this reason, because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD intit."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further on historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because perhaps someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without a reinstallation and re-formatting. therefore you must ensure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service you want to start the system or switch to another runlevel. system services do not include such things like network, NFS, & sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things like setserial, which will only be started once. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">You can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel search init at various points and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can manually edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have a little confused, then you can fix it by restarting the system and executing the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script is called with the argument stop. if it includes an S, the script is called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server runlevel that only runs httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; using a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not tell trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also shift scripts between runlevelds or change the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else. this will only happen if they pull out an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved if you move them into a new area. to just copy them to a new Runtime, you must explicitly copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and add to the target range -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the custodial numbers of the entries before you can again try to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present, there is no way to restore items thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tab key to activate the different fields of work (available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to manually change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the Enter key to open the properties dialog. use the Tab key to change the properties dialog. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of loss of data, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. pre-settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be recovered from & ksysv; otherwise they will be stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard runleveling, and now the machine starts constantly. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; available for running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only present in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies configuration for proprietary programming programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not comply with any standard. the authors of & ksysv are planning an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using a different distribution, please check that all configuration files are available which are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as eg; Apache or httpd) are simply without message when their configuration files are not available or set up correctly."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; Runtier varies from distribution to distribution, can even vary from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation relates to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
