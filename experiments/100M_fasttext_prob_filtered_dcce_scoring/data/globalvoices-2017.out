&quot; although I visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love of America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily great .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , dancing American music , reading American authors and running his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound impact on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who wanted to occupy the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil mag@@ n@@ ate as a Jura student , who wanted to occupy the Supreme Court with judges who were inclined to his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free after Method Man , &quot; I was , as if it is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only intensi@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; &quot; America is the only country I &apos;ve ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had written a very dirty love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me as he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; with his view , he never stops behind the mountain , as one says so beautifully . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague expresses it , and openly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and tuned in pairs for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won in the republi@@ can elections , was the highest number ever seen by the party nominated by the party . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans , who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not bring Tr@@ ump and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , which takes people from around the world , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; likewise , Tr@@ um@@ ps did not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current publisher of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix Suns &quot; at the game .
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who strug@@ gl@@ ed for the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits to Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es &apos;s commitment , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Le@@ aks , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love of America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump hired his way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential candidate , she gave me a halt and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception to rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were prepared to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; to categ@@ ori@@ ze people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is super@@ ficial and resp@@ ect@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not considered .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to elev@@ ate a man who looks from cont@@ emp@@ t to those who look different than he . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( p@@ m. from Ü ) : as much as &quot; &quot; el@@ on@@ gation of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cs &quot; &quot; ; word play from white in reference to the wh@@ ites and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the great Van Jones called , has exactly what America made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background one may have , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of Ken@@ yan , whose history as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; however , with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , there is a huge part of the white Americas this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back on the helm , say . &quot;
&quot; in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your USA ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; bro@@ o@@ ed the crowd . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your Americas ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your Americas ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , could have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the country , for which his son fell , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; that is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and that will break my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero commune in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ ean city of Cat@@ eur@@ a ?
&quot; the music played in both places , not only has changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre@@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for a few years now , the La b@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence . &quot;
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope of hope .
&quot; the young band members take their commitments across the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from the school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they are always laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the tur@@ tle you will learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , tim@@ pani , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from W@@ aste
&quot; more than 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village located at the top of the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ prepared instruments made from local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the recycl@@ ers have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all made out of gar@@ bage . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article from the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and teacher of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , rec@@ alls : &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in gar@@ bage . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something he had never seen before : a violin made out of waste .
today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments from re@@ processed material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic Müll@@ de@@ pon@@ ie ) records the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of tr@@ ash every year .
&quot; those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - like the people of Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of gar@@ bage to music around the world .
the orchestra has even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can fight illegal fishing successfully
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practiced solutions for environmental issues . &quot;
re@@ publication occurs as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a legislative break@@ er of this species on its shores .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to b@@ ypass one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fisher@@ man &apos;s approval . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the Ken@@ yan fishing agency . he is part of a team who discovered and persec@@ uted the ship . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it was not successful for him to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pl@@ under@@ ing the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( illegal fishing stop ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries who then exp@@ elled the prime minister from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand up to each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , where it is extremely difficult to detect . therefore , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were imp@@ eded by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions nowadays occur in real time , with trac@@ e@@ ability to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there the individual countries can exchange , for example , lists existing licenses , news about suspic@@ ious activities or details that one noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very carefully when they move on the open sea by means of satellite data .
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas , such as those who indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly if they have a criminal record . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of this information , countries who are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such information in their har@@ bours . what means that the ships cannot be sold for their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay sanctions , as in the case of prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to reg@@ ain estimated $ 20 million in lost revenue , which lost eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year due to the illegal fishermen inv@@ ading in East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries , where the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; their practices include activities such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , specification of fan@@ ciful names , fish protected species and fish in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the missing international cooperation and make the weaknesses of an un@@ brid@@ led control system &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; previously a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; You do not run my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
&quot; so far , the closed front works . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspic@@ ious ships . &quot;
it has un@@ covered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found escap@@ ing ships .
&quot; due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over long distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to detect suspic@@ ious ships more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track the illegal ships that are happy to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their positions , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg Mat Tracking , a NGO that also deals with fishing data and offers technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems , for example , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system linking different levels of information . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ ally acting ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oc@@ e@@ ana Marine Protection Organization : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed throughout the world by means of the position of each trac@@ eable ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; join together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who does what to do - that simply makes sense , &quot; he says . &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and bund@@ le their resources . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run in which a global system allows tracking of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not just detect crimin@@ als , but also deter them . &quot;
&quot; ships that used to be f@@ ished without a license and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have now reached a 33 % rise in fishing turnover , since fishing boats are buying more lic@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board hau@@ ling nets , whose use is forbidden . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear every year by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; there are six countries joined together in 2015 , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . also , they are fighting illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s most recent member state Somalia could report his first big triumph : in October Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship running under false flag . and not only the ship was on the way without a license , and were used hau@@ ling nets that are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was still penet@@ rated into prohibited waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they fight against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collaborative way of working for the protection of the oceans is actually working throughout the world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . there she writes on the subject of environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TE@@ D Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . location in Venezuela is escal@@ ating : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of rec@@ ap@@ turing the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela denied the application of the opposition to a referendum on the dism@@ iss@@ al , Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations about the political and economic crisis of the country went into empt@@ iness by assembling on the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the recovery of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found . &quot;
&quot; the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among other things in the Bar@@ inas flat land@@ area , in the Andes @-@ regions of Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ north located Bun@@ dest@@ a@@ at Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country continues to deteri@@ or@@ ate , which makes itself noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the revit@@ alization of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro ; ultimately , the holding of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ ors to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the government decision in her latest article as follows : &quot;
&quot; within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and tissue rate belong to the highest all over the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum for many as the only way to restore its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the election bal@@ lot Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( such as : round table of the Democratic Unit ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , called for the support of the National Assembly on 27 October . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday national civil war and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;

&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the Action Program &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot;
&quot; the images of the mart@@ yrs which are published in real time are witness@@ ing an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as pro@@ pon@@ ents of the government . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , pictures of conflicts tell , as well as reports of repression and abuse . &quot;
especially big waves beat the news on police repression in the central @-@ north city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement in front of the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
&quot; hours later they were able to leave the cathedral , but the protests went further . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise one could see something that many national gar@@ den@@ ers do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic set up the round which forms the extent of oppression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a ten@@ ure process - this has been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of inn@@ um@@ erable people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs says :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of sig@@ natures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your res@@ ign@@ ation !
on the street !
&quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which has taken little against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and has preferred to silence critical voices : &quot;
you have taken us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media they were too hungry to participate in a strike , instead of working or shopping . &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to visit the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as a now grown man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Córdoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated , committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; he started to bear the same name as his father , until the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison which he watched at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept the secret of family secrets .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I thought that was fine . &quot;
I felt like a Geh@@ ei@@ mag@@ ent .
&quot; as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , torture and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ me official . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was from 1976 to 1978 Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department of 141 in La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pres@@ sor who was charged with ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the kid@@ n@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy , and he said before a court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose for himself a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . &quot;
everybody called him K@@ ent .
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my boy@@ friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have friends with one of the ERP . &quot;

that is why he offered me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would be en@@ vy .
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation , I thought that would be fine . for so , my father had educated me . &quot;
&quot; at the military base , I had to destroy documents that had belonged to the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : University Deg@@ re@@ es , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ There the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small pack wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were stopped and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; I looked into it , and saw a couch that men were tor@@ tured . &quot;
it looked like a field bed and metal feathers .
later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable . the other end was fast@@ ened to the body of the person that was just tied up there .
&quot; they rarely hold a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ thrown him with water and hun@@ ted him a load of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the st@@ ank there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately and it became clear that it is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ?
I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were wearing and binding . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian , who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying face down - all were tied at hands and feet .
&quot; near the entrance , people kept silent on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What am you doing so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me down ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
&quot; they were thrown into a pit , and were killed and buried by soldiers . &quot;
I know this because my father told me at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero killed a man there and killed .
&quot; according to the survivors , the Zi@@ vi@@ cian Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera court , was sentenced to death by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio F@@ essi@@ a , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way where the kid@@ n@@ apping came here .
&quot; if you look on the map , you see that they took about this path and were tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement from above came that they should be reloc@@ ated . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war ute &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things home .
&quot; at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was in the military , I was in G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war prey is a bay@@ onet , or perhaps military badge , which is taken against an enemy that is fought against . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the record player , clothing , painting , money ... ste@@ als , then it is not war , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
&quot; once he called me a criminal and I answered : and you , who gave cars on the street ? &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded against anger , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you . &quot;
&quot; to do so , we need nobody else ! &quot;
so was my father .
I have not a single good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo from that time on which I wore a jacket and a roll collar pul@@ lover . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me on the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ The dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel regre@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , one can recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , so you have executed people during the dictatorship , but why the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children kid@@ n@@ apped ?
&quot; one day my father took a girl with her mother , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it would have been easy to put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did these people not even have families with whom to hand over their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
I have seen how you killed people !
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my dad .
&quot; the thought to display my father arose during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
I had given him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience because of it .
then he suddenly said : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t have killed anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly kick@@ ed and asked me why the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; which they allegedly defended were actually good . &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something about it ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Well , forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I ref@@ unded the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally declared against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 still before the end of the trial .

the jud@@ gements in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the Spanish on the magnitude of judgment .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended in August 1975 and December 1978 committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims last August . &quot;
43 op@@ pres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the Court sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases of prison sentences between 2 and 14 years .
eleven of the original 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Perm judgment : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ war@@ state terrorism &quot;
&quot; all def@@ endants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civil servants . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Monti was kid@@ n@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the dig@@ ni@@ fying chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years for justice for victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , representing the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but the research lasted 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that there was a place to be erected there , which is now being led by human rights organisations . &quot;

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot;
&quot; the shield with the translation errors in a Kyoto centre , where you can extend your driving license . &quot;
the photo was distributed in the social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving license , last month witnessed a very un@@ fortunate translation . &quot;
&quot; on one shield the Japanese word ( kor@@ ei@@ ta@@ sha ) , the &quot; older motor@@ ist &quot; means , wron@@ g@@ ly - perhaps also with mal@@ icious background than@@ king &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; fear@@ ful motor@@ ists . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
&quot; Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photos , often shared in social media . &quot;
&quot; the error was similar to the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n , which appears in Kyoto , wrote : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto , simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the title &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the more appropriate , if also gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto pre@@ fecture was ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation has not been checked for correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the excuse :
&quot; we sincer@@ ely feel that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by inadequate correc@@ tions ( the translation ) , &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News dealt with the phenomenon of the &quot; fri@@ able &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; was den@@ o@@ unced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older motor@@ ists who are involved in accidents across the country is quite a concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture , for example , a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by senior citizens in 2005 , representing a 10 % share . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents is decl@@ ining , the share of accidents caused by sen@@ iors increased in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ named repor@@ ter , published in the article published on Yahoo , comments on the light that show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to have against older drivers : &quot;
the Yahoo article on the translation errors has among other things received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; fear@@ ful driving &quot; ) about not the reality ?
&quot; - &quot; &quot; So bad the translation is actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for this bizarre mistake in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language pro@@ fici@@ ency in order to transfer it into the target language . &quot;
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case in native speakers . generally speaking is the conviction that trans@@ lators in the target language - not in the source language - should be native speakers .
&quot; for example , French native speakers should translate from English into French - not from the French into English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language , the translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who do not have foreign employees , can still make translations in @-@ house . then , the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the confused and mysterious phrases that arise by machine translation , show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious prints which often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but by large companies or by the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more meticul@@ ous translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the Kyoto city will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the Internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ con con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Media and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online broad@@ c@@ aster Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer available . &quot;
other online transm@@ itters also carried recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups who oppose Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
&quot; the protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ o . he pointed out that the connection was ch@@ apped and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as &quot; &quot; call for violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national television channels , I have registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
ast@@ o@@ unding that this is still more favorable than buying two liters of lem@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ Sin@@ filtr@@ ator later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online transm@@ itters . &quot;
&quot; earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique through which the DNS server respond to specific domain requests . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds incorrect or ref@@ uses the request when calling such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , was transferred on Thursday , 6th April , when V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was imprisoned . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in custo@@ dy .
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government is regul@@ ating the internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ an access to multimedia reports on the current events in the country more and more difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and g@@ athers testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ ades , who have been victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the shor@@ tened version of a structural report published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ elas que CA@@ EN &quot; ( &quot; flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
&quot; shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house , and heard how the owner of the house was proud of her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one that has become something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old she began working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay , in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is simple : a large family with little money passes her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , more abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned is that the children must do so countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse will be - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted . &quot;
&quot; this practice , called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ o@@ unced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated by the Cri@@ mean is generally silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; declares Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family who finds her daughter in the belief that she will complete her training , improve her position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl and justi@@ fies the exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise not receive education and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will only experience it many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never learn about it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon occurred , which takes place in the secre@@ tion of Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of heavy blows . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was in the household of the former military member Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra hit Mar@@ ín as long as he suffered mort@@ al injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
they emphasized that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UNI@@ CE@@ F or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go deeply rooted in the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s death for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as a modern form of slavery .
several dozen people gathered to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organizations called for a rapid investigation of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was her cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín would be directional - if the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ ans are not only exploited as labour forces , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ mer in which her father worked , forced bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to work all now and began selling sweets on the street , or on the market , to make money . &quot;
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
&quot; in the House of her employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she had to divide the time in such a way that you still have time to learn . &quot;
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employers .
&quot; for example , clean the fridge , pl@@ ast@@ ered the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was finished , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she finished studying , the more free time she had . &quot;
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also didn &apos;t have limited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the master &apos;s library as food from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ers of the parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who belonged to the Opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings , the landlord al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and read editorial articles from the &quot; &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them to not believe in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; he kept them intelligent , but did not enter@@ tain with her . &quot; the host had found someone who listened to while talking about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family , because they thought that I would learn &quot; bad habits &quot; there again . &quot;
they feared that they would lose the education they had made it possible to lose .
but she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
&quot; even at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; a thing about which almost never is spoken , are bul@@ lying and the ch@@ ic@@ ans exposed to Cri@@ min@@ tas when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone , who has no parents , is a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I could not invite anyone to me home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I was not a group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; &quot; declares Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
society endor@@ ses cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and child girls in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the group &apos;s administrators is P@@ epa Kos@@ ti@@ anov@@ sky , a city counc@@ ill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot;
&quot; Hi ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter , who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon . &quot;
for learning .
please log in .
starting from Monday when possible .
&quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; likes &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot;
a woman out of the town Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an el@@ eventh girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; a girl from the country inner who wants to work &quot; . &quot; &quot;
then the dra@@ fters sha@@ ved once again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I try to see if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again if something is . &quot;
the business was complete .
&quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( how long ? ) , a collection of witness statements of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history , we managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) and the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors who ens@@ lav@@ ed the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores , the wives of the Guar@@ an@@ í , and the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors who were depri@@ ved of the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors of the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors and their wives turned into a system of slavery , where they become light victims of abuse and exploitation . &quot;
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and that to show power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill to write Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently agreed to draft a bill on &quot; &quot; regul@@ ating the use and use of social networks &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if he is accepted by Parliament , users of social media must register in Egypt at a governmental authority in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up which is tas@@ ked with providing citizens with permission to share social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of adoption of the law , users on the website would have to register their right names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money . &quot;
&quot; the bill consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de , &quot; which is run over the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video and text . &quot;
&quot; it is uncle@@ ar how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted , as the draft has no indication of how the Egyptian authorities should adopt the registration . uncle@@ ar is also how the Egyptian authorities are not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ adh Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Parliament representatives and promot@@ ers of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password from the telecommunic@@ ation department to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of it , it would be necessary for Egyptians to access information about their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; senior research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt strongly about the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they pret@@ end that just as they are for@@ ci@@ ble physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , that means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who seek approval or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a trial . &quot;
&quot; this is technically not at all realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative elections and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in accordance with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in the Parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the parliam@@ ent@@ arians of Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legal action against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was intended to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and to inc@@ ite protests . &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq work the animal shelter H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq to protect the hor@@ ny Persian le@@ op@@ ard .
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which wi@@ pes through Africa and Asia , belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered due to wild animals , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find less and less boot@@ y . &quot;
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; The Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining beast of the Kur@@ dish ecosystem &quot; &quot; and the health and remembrance of the ecosystem depends on the fact that there is a big pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video shows that they have a large cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza passi@@ on@@ ately shows a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies for wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .

&quot; in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for the northeast of Japan , documented the progress made in the last six years to re@@ build the lives of those killed by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a violent earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma triggered the disaster . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in S@@ end@@ ai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture was a pre@@ fecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring architec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to ev@@ acu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had lost entire coastal cities from the map . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ fecture has been living a nuclear accident , for this reason alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
&quot; from a local point of view , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to re@@ build the lives of local residents . &quot;
the detailed report of the newspaper contains the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves .
&quot; housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to list the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were finished . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such homes , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is a 70 percent closing light . &quot;
&quot; still , six years after the catastrophe , the ev@@ acu@@ ated von Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ sau@@ lt ( of the &quot; &quot; Bul@@ k@@ kas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u &quot; &quot; ) could be reloc@@ ated to final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the three @-@ fold catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in homes . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 per cent of those ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live in emergency homes , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , which breath@@ ed after the disaster in homes , were res@@ ett@@ led to final homes . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected
&quot; like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors to December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 per cent of fishing har@@ bours are in operation in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , only 30 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours have res@@ um@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have grown largely in the three Pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Agricultural land .
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of devast@@ ated ar@@ able land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear pl@@ ywood area . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely again , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far away . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 per cent on the same level , as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only exhibit 75 per cent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal inhabitants , it is difficult to find their livel@@ ihood . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to be able to establish an overall picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and ev@@ acu@@ ated by the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; in her introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung comments : &quot;
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;

how it stands for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ fecture
&quot; in their issue to commemor@@ ate the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also increased their attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the huge earthquake and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ fecture also witnessed the worst , disaster @-@ induced , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were displac@@ ed in areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 there were over 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , converted into permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; according to the 2017 state , 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live outside their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation areas are more than 50 years old in the disaster areas . it is known that the efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive building projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games , which will take place in Tokyo in 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people meet people from other countries speaking another language , the differences seem to be larger than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more joins than it seems at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important since they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspective and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
she talks about the simil@@ arities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love of music has consolidated her aff@@ ection to Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa re@@ members how the love of music has led to the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brasili@@ an activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations

right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit last Friday . last Friday a police officer had struck him with a strike in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a strike against the head . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated him this Saturday and put him in an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days . &quot;
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the military police reported in the Brazilian state Go@@ i@@ ás , that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the examination of the incident on the active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers how he strikes the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer would be beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and land on the intensive ward , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ eur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media activ@@ ist from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus attacked by the police officer and hur@@ ry several param@@ edi@@ cs shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but fil@@ med from a different perspective , is also appeared in social networks . &quot;
in the below clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , Internet users meanwhile donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while lying in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás is experiencing a wave of political force : here , the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was killed by his father because he was killed by the Occup@@ y Movement in secondary schools . &quot;
hand@@ cu@@ ffed
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where there was a brutal police action against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; police officers deployed protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber floors and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the MEP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to reno@@ unce violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media cover street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a wind@@ shield . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reported on a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their cover pages with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a fire @-@ set bus . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing . &quot;
this must also be recognised if you are strictly against any kind of damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is an absurd , di@@ spro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines entitled &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
the For@@ gotten Vill@@ ages in Cuba from the de@@ indu@@ str@@ alization
&quot; with the introduction of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso &apos;s law , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in whole Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the popular Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cu@@ ban province of May@@ ab@@ e@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ zed in the sugar cane factories .
&quot; after the acquisition , the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ ute daily to the factories that are still grinding .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active period because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene rec@@ alls to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry with@@ stood the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are not new . &quot;
why was the Cu@@ ban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway stei@@ g of the community saw even better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated , and they were hardly competitive for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the small productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
but the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar will remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 published report of the OECD and FA@@ O , the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; the first words of the Cu@@ ban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the Su@@ gar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich sugar cane factory on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , is the word he most repe@@ ats , &quot; Sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order to get the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first meeting , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially recorded documents , which would differ only concerning the parts that would be removed , the address and date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was over and the letters came more and more frequently . &quot;
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories in operation .
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , wa@@ its for retirement in another plant called Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved with his will at the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he dis@@ mounted one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the most developed industrial area developed by Cuba and the most important industrial producer was wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for the employment and services they generated in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present persons saw , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the Par@@ ish Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learnt that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to disman@@ tle them , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories . &quot;
they were assigned to spare parts .
&quot; without a promising perspective , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created whose production does not even serve for supplying the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new facility are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand pes@@ o a month to spend the years reti@@ ring in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin @-@ color , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a suppor@@ tive person , yet he for@@ gives the lies that one told him . &quot;
they torture him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes into retirement with 65 years , not because it lacks power , but because he is bitter . &quot;

&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour , workshops super@@ vis@@ es mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
the original workshops were conducted by the educ@@ ator David H@@ od@@ ges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e hip hop group The North@@ star .
&quot; the workshop empha@@ sizes that the young participants engage in talks such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum Cal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; a road section in West Canada , where almost two dozen young women were disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely not elu@@ ci@@ dated .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influence of glob@@ alisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us will be sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved here received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ star hip hop group , who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ scription , as well a translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to go on my days on earth
this is the day when you will take our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise to one day
I don &apos;t want to see how to live a bad life
&quot; this way , they can grow and continue our youth as well . &quot;
&quot; so , they can do what the Creator intended to do . &quot;
&quot; in the commentary section , the reader and advoc@@ ate of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contributed and inserts the stop@@ he in sy@@ ll@@ abi ( which is published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;
&quot; plastic dishes ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; traditional &quot; &quot; ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot;

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are exhibited near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tics models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) issued by any food served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to producing these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a number of these small companies producing those plastic dishes , which the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most of the Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they are not even more noticeable to them . however , a new trend now turns into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome published the Blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new plastic rib@@ b@@ ons decorated with plastic rib@@ b@@ ons as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collecting objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of Essen@@ ti@@ als is becoming increasingly more time @-@ consuming .
in this case a ca@@ ise @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was turned into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
also this part was made for the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your cell phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is only the beginning of an increasing pl@@ ough into the Com@@ intern .
&quot; some mobile stand and mobile designers allow you to make your own work of art . in this case , ic@@ ura or salmon @-@ dec@@ eived are used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter ro@@ che@@ ers ? . &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic courts can also take a less appe@@ tizing form , for example , to surprise colleagues or family members . &quot;
our latest mobile stand has the shape of mel@@ ted ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also pad@@ st@@ ables ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ bags made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; other sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be found at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow Twitter on the h@@ ash@@ tag # of the &quot; &quot; h@@ ash@@ tag # &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; Bul@@ ly &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origins of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the C@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi area , which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry . like with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the Mis@@ sing and Be@@ asts pl@@ unge into statistics on a regular basis . however , these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings . &quot;
&quot; reports on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , urged the stories of victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each cor@@ p@@ se , behind every bone finding in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never heal . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug traff@@ icking &quot; ) . &quot;
animal pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , if shops close because they are threatened by drug traff@@ ick@@ ers and that whole municipalities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the Pain of Sac@@ ri@@ fice
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( english : &quot; like fear life &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for every weekend secret tom@@ bs after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task we have placed before , and to look for gra@@ ves , according to the people we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he was supposed to be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me because I am alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you have the assurance of my father , but she does not pay them out because they require a death certificate . &quot;
where shall we get them ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must show not only the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have known illness and sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for several years now .
&quot; every day I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or out of specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the socket .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year old c@@ ousin thinks he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me this is , as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that they also have something happening . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; the sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness of men is incredible to me , when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village justified it that they were &quot; resident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to persu@@ ade them that they remain spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ ring and quiet . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the Haupt@@ stadt@@ distri@@ kt : how a family with threats was lo@@ oted out . &quot; in this , it describes how armed crimin@@ als month paid money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business but also torn their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and remember how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain of it never fails , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes back again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the more we are away from each other , the better . &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they are kid@@ n@@ apped or killed . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days whether we@@ eping would resolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; the journalist , Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega , published the article &quot; The Un@@ ch@@ art@@ ed Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents care about them .
&quot; Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ descri@@ b@@ able for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood had been past two years earlier , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody cor@@ p@@ se of his father , who was shot by armed men out of a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as violence by organised crime and fighting against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings according to the Government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor had 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings . this equ@@ ates to 8.5 kill@@ ings per day . &quot;
these are just a few hundred thousand stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we must not forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; animal pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the Nar@@ co@@ data journ@@ alism project , whose aim is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traff@@ icking that has tor@@ tured the country in the last four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the sites to which he links , include pictures on which violence is represented . &quot;
the fact @-@ check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing fal@@ si@@ fication .
&quot; but how is the years after something has appeared the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been mis@@ led to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; &quot; false description &quot; &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 a tank truck crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated it . the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of pot@@ holes that were difficult to drive . &quot;
trag@@ ically the tank truck fell victim to the victim .
&quot; officials of the authorities described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses , including a cinema close by , which was full of people who watched the football World Cup . &quot;
houses burned and carbon@@ ated cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; an image entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horri@@ ble scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows series of carbon@@ ated bodies that are str@@ ung on the ground while people look at them .
but here the story does not end its end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was taken up several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wron@@ g@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic of atro@@ cities before which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and cor@@ p@@ ses were placed in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; nobody left behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; said one inhabit@@ ant of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were ch@@ ased , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time was shown in a figur@@ ative way . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to gain land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo as it was wron@@ g@@ ly presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ usi@@ ve use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of de@@ preci@@ ation and Africa check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all these cases the picture was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings .
&quot; one step further , personal comments like this example fal@@ sely fal@@ si@@ fy the image from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to provide arguments . &quot;
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning news , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee were pun@@ ches , rape and several dead , some through burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported on the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture was taken by an Saudi Arabian news site , wron@@ g@@ ly claimed in 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein have said , monks and politicians were involved in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from DR Congo to make this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was last accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news agencies , who called AF@@ P as their source , had also mistakenly attribute this statement to Th@@ ein Sein and had not connected the picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false coupling reach back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; using an &quot; &quot; revers@@ ed picture search &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can transc@@ end boundaries . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 images at 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixture of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have forwarded false reports , others have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have bor@@ dered examples of mis@@ use and linked them to the respective countries , on the basis of what they were published on which side they were published . thus , we want to represent the reach more clearly than by language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also linked ) , several examples may be used for mis@@ use . &quot;
here are some cases which can now be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Frames .
examples of false inter@@ connections of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the orange @-@ colored lands refer to pages or servers , which are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or false reports . &quot;
&quot; countries in Gra@@ y are examples , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also due to counter@@ f@@ eit samples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a &quot; &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Canada , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this article , a blo@@ gger from Quebec City does not only use the false news , but also discusses the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria and further questions regarding the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved ( in DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;
&quot; Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los cris@@ ti@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria they burn the Christians ) . &quot;
&quot; in this article about explo@@ sions in northern Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place . &quot;
La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca cited as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although not known whether the original report included the picture ) .
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; according to the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this , who used the image of the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; clearly did not see pages such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster , which contra@@ dict it . &quot;

&quot; Iran , 2012 . &quot;
a German Association of The@@ ology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on N@@ asi@@ m News Agency and illustr@@ ative the image of DR Congo .
&quot; Italy , 2015 . &quot;
an inhabit@@ ant of the old@@ town P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o of Tr@@ ento posted this news on his side to express solidarity with the Nigeria massacre .
&quot; Brazil , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; even within Nigeria , the photo taken from the DR Congo as proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano was divided into public discussion forums . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ usi@@ ve use of the picture from the DR Congo , expressing sympathy over the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the alleg@@ ations that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are prosec@@ uted , since the photos were mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government released a decision on what it meant as &quot; inten@@ tionally f@@ ing@@ ed news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings about Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this judge , which is exclusively published in English , also includes counter@@ f@@ eit images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Speech are operated and used by extrem@@ ist groups to explain that Muslims are killing Budd@@ hi@@ sts and others ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , addressed to the members of the Orthodox Church , is clear that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news site fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar was Th@@ ein Sein in 2012 , that monks and politicians were involved in killing the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still contained in it .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the now deleted , the Catholic close news page An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , has expressly declared that the image is not taken from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar d@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture later became circul@@ ated in connection with B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , the El Pa@@ is newspaper tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ j@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the image of the DR Congo , marked with this T@@ witter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve a greater attention to these events , which took place presum@@ ably in the name of Islam . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as evidence of the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ) . but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
&quot; instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and to compare the media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that allegedly was written by a &quot; &quot; Pater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false . &quot;
&quot; from the message in which the image was contained in the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos was dis@@ soci@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of er@@ ron@@ eous use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; in other accounts , aggregate and pages in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture ultimately bears a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and images
there are two strong topics or frames that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assass@@ inations of Christians through Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
understanding religion and the value of human life is both important . it is therefore worthwhile to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers no longer believe these pictures . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggestion this mood of mis@@ - and false information , that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and does it dimin@@ ish the real horror of what happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a ref@@ usal to recognise the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even asked by the victims themselves .
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images of readers and viewers des@@ ensi@@ tise and have the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media work on helping others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is some debate about violent demonstrations in the news media , the fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage . &quot;
techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about situations in which an image suggests something which actually can also be detached from context or completely ab@@ usi@@ ve way .
&quot; however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons uses in accordance with CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( for example insi@@ di@@ ble ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to be translated at all .
such words can be found in any language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these conf@@ lic@@ able words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese acid ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example Spanish so@@ b@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected in an online list for a while .
&quot; most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from V@@ anu@@ atu &apos;s V@@ anu@@ atu tax , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - we@@ ari@@ ze for your parents in recognition of how to make your efforts in your younger years .
words in the H@@ uns@@ et language spoken in parts of Brazil such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after having war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Birds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
&quot; they ent@@ angle other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of these &quot; &quot; conf@@ lic@@ able &quot; &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of &quot; &quot; Treasure Languages &quot; &quot; which are appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favourite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst flood disaster of the decade
Sri Lanka &apos;s island state is currently facing the worst flood and floo@@ ds in this decade .
&quot; caused by the mon@@ soon that normally uses the end of May , rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ mo@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country have stepped onto the shore . &quot;
&quot; according to an opinion of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floo@@ ds and mud @-@ winds . &quot;
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe places of residence .
&quot; the ra@@ ins left on Saturday ( May 27th ) , and the waters in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ds in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ds wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , war@@ ns Save the Children , after more ra@@ inf@@ all are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; this morning , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was in flood water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle was also floo@@ ded because of the water peg@@ s of Mor@@ og@@ oda El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations and further five are made ready for transport of emergency supplies for the inhabitants enclosed in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups have also decided to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood and humanitarian assistance .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals in this area need help .
&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the app , so that the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum will be informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me led a &quot; Hoch@@ wasser@@ hilfe &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then forwarded for free to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; they also introduced a &quot; SO@@ S &quot; button , which resulted in more than one thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ds and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need to security and provide aid . &quot;
&quot; this prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to the restoration of norm@@ ality . &quot;
the Muslims you cannot see
&quot; the Women &apos;s March , 21 January 2017 , in San Francisco . &quot;
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and loving girl@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts in me her children . she is my rock in the surf . &quot;
in the one minute we call even slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
&quot; in the next few years , we advoc@@ ate trans@@ gender rights . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the icon@@ ic image of a woman with a head@@ scarf , bound from an American flag , others are competing slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girl@@ friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I have been working or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar , which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they dissi@@ p@@ ate me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify with them to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit in there , will be dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot;
ab@@ domin@@ op@@ last@@ y
I don &apos;t stand alone .
&quot; this even happened to the poet , whose poetry is mostly sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which images come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were until the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western idea religion was deleted , just like the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the story of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing picture language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
&quot; in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid destroyed the story behind these pictures . &quot;
but these images prot@@ ru@@ de even today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ u@@ ate them . &quot;
&quot; I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how this powerful , flaw@@ less narrative domin@@ ates our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries over the last three decades , while the United States did not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying out their head@@ scarf in public buildings and forcing Saudi Arabia to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercises his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; this strong Nar@@ r@@ ative sw@@ ells Muslim women , who lead movements for change . &quot;
&quot; it considers that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans , who were brought here with slave ships . &quot;
it extingu@@ ishes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has filled our collective imagination so deeply and in@@ correctly that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children become the goal of anti @-@ militar@@ ist attacks and fiction .
&quot; because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
1.7 billion are part of
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ atives who help us understand the world .
and my industry is fail@@ ing to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed , where seven million Muslims account for the highest degree of &quot; diverse &quot; religious groups in America . &quot;
more than one third of the total Muslim population is African @-@ stock@@ ed Americans .
&quot; six out of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants of the first generation , coming from 77 countries . &quot;
the parents of the author 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ st of Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan had re@@ designed the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were s@@ ore Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I s@@ ore Muslims and Americans now ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some handker@@ chief , which all Muslims wear with themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am jo@@ king , we don &apos;t carry all the bun@@ ni@@ es with us . &quot;
we don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be a &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter @-@ religious activists seeking to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ decorated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for false information , which have already manipul@@ ated our already defective image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in more than just a stranger who r@@ enters the head of a woman . &quot;
&quot; or as the frigh@@ tening map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole US , see below . &quot;

Islam hos@@ tility in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our belonging .
&quot; it attacks our identity , which is so expan@@ sive , so versatile and complex that it is impossible to fit into a drawer . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but being a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they attack the following concepts : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girl@@ friend , my neighbor , my rock in br@@ anding , would see that I am Muslim if she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I wie@@ v them in my arms , and her the Arab Ver@@ ses to protect the Koran and call the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; please note that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim nation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; belonging to my grand@@ mother , the image of my grand@@ mother is mother@@ ly with her sisters , how she gained a competition of the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades . &quot;
&quot; it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her finished and incomplete paintings painted Su@@ fi Hei@@ liger ; and a Kor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers that she had told me when I have a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people who - over centuries - was colon@@ ised by an &quot; &quot; Empire &quot; , &quot; which established a company with the name Ehr@@ worthy British Ost@@ liner Company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he wrote books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan we@@ pt un@@ wrapped around his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he was not allowed to close in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at stake . &quot;
to be Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have colon@@ ised all to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aircraft bomb of history was dis@@ car@@ ded over a century ago by a Muslim country .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , ash@@ mere under@@ tan of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , since he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops , scattered across every continent apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that if a tragedy the US is pun@@ ishing and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ ination . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago , the first call for prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slave . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that two hundred years ago , an African Islam schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought to this country . &quot;
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people filled the airports to fight against the Muslim .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ess , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a Muslim and a journalist , signi@@ fies the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but to fail to communicate with others . &quot;
&quot; the narrative of 1.7 billion poses more possibilities than a magic cube , but it is represented in the reduced doubt &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons build upon this duality of structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility is in Muslim Regi@@ str@@ ations , which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama . &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer who takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that closes its borders towards people from the countries that are bom@@ bed .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly list &quot; , &quot; which largely refers to Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars we lead and the bombs , which we throw off on Muslim lands . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University showed a scienti@@ fically correct picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we need to Lead
&quot; we are too deeply advised to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are coming back decades to recognise the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous bil@@ ing@@ ual prints which we perpet@@ u@@ ate in our news editors . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our identi@@ ties and forgotten history in many cases . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast See Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Muslim Brotherhood - all this makes me hope . &quot;

but I am concerned because of this difficult global time point in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that exceed 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason why conspiracy the@@ or@@ ists , who existed in the dark corners of the internet , now lead the White House . &quot;
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , it had not yet been given ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was as old as it was my daughter , but who today turned me into an un@@ changing Muslim . &quot;
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps ar@@ ouse memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity possesses , a history may listen to where someone is made to a &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , con@@ stell@@ ations take place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with &quot; others , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
but these are not concepts we usually have in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people were en@@ forced by the work of the &quot; other &quot; in public performance , four decades even scientist of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions according to the role of this , consciously and un@@ consciously rein@@ force the &quot; other &quot; as it was my girl@@ friend and me in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake , while he already bombar@@ ded &quot; &quot; people &quot; , &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn P@@ erry , founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices recently reported another initiative by Steven Bird , the inv@@ inci@@ ble blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of big cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has performed events since 2015 , the risk is that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; the mass ext@@ inction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities , accept diversity - secure spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to . &quot;
&quot; while listening often associated with &quot; understanding &quot; these events instead &quot; listening to , &quot; to feel , to make . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers present their story in their own language first and translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their dedication and their representation are leading to the audience . &quot;
they cry out laughter and emotions than the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou accounts also take the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art for her country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ ug@@ ara tells the be@@ ak of the h@@ are and the bab@@ oon in the language of Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ í@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad smile he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treasure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities and the organis@@ ers hope to extend this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ y@@ telling tours . &quot;
Puerto Rico demands re@@ constitution of sovereign debt by the United States
&quot; with the goal of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took place on 72 million US dollars , on April 3 , 2017 several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the Pu@@ ertor@@ ic@@ ian Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old city of San Ju@@ an . &quot;
&quot; it was proclaimed by the group &quot; &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; &quot; ( civil front for the re @-@ examination of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical Assembly of Puerto Rico . &quot;
the advoc@@ ates of the re@@ constitution of debts have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their requirement :
&quot; the people of Puerto Rico require that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts must be held responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial review and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions appropriate remun@@ eration paid in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people Puerto Rico ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be det@@ ained with decl@@ ining reti@@ re@@ es .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the state alliance integrated territory of the USA - suff@@ ers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot;

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue to campaign for his freedom and remind the contributions he made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re @-@ conference : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , dedicated an event to the # Free@@ B@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , a managing director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publishing house published by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; , a publisher of books published by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; within three to five days , a publishing house of the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
the book published last year contains a series of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of repression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built , and what the real cost is , with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have side by side to look beyond the fog , which sur@@ rounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who have been det@@ ained in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
his name was cancelled from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release , and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for its participation in a free culture , many of us have started to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of times of extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custo@@ dy of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown location from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el had taken part in A@@ dra &quot; as a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the Military Court . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that it was contacted by people on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband . &quot;
but its location and state remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels had cultural prototypes fores@@ ighted than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important arche@@ ological sites in the world , was the cross @-@ cross of numerous civili@@ zations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , b@@ ass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would do everything to wi@@ pe out this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this stri@@ fe into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el could not yet close this project . &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
&quot; I spent my entire life living with freedom , and b@@ ass@@ el taught me to embrace it . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el gave me English even when he was in jail .
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ s@@ thesis , which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband , when he was in custo@@ dy . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for one year .
she sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available free of charge .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens during each visit , &quot;
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes
&quot; that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards &quot;
I forget the j@@ ails of the prison
and I am in every detail of your voice and words
&quot; which I wear with passion , &quot;
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I return quickly to my sol@@ itude , &quot;
&quot; to bring back all the moments , &quot;
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...
G@@ haz@@ i wrote on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el :
&quot; one year passes , my soul &quot;
during
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
the history of Bas@@ sels is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; by 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in custo@@ dy since 2011 according to the international human rights organization Am@@ ne@@ sty International . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today we repeat our demand in the hope that we must do this for the last time .
Mozambique : head of corruption condemned by corruption back to previous post
&quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption case , where a government member after half of his prison sentence returned to the working place in the state apparatus in which the corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010 , together with four other def@@ endants , was sentenced to 22 years in jail together with four other def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the Mos@@ ambi@@ k airports , whose advice was Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re @-@ attitude to the company , which happened on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , who evaluated the application , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ b@@ aza , to return to his old post , since the company has not fulfilled any disciplinary procedure after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants are not enjoying the action . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution responsible for public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to address the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle . &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take note is that the company should also introduce a disciplinary approach against the wron@@ g@@ doing .
&quot; however , the company seems , however , and caused no appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , an important voice in the mos@@ aic social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence , and half of them had dinner . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inf@@ lict damage . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is gladly paid for his silence . &quot;
disgu@@ sting !
&quot; bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ an and student of political science in Brazil says that the director has no moral : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state , because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that you are rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza lacks mor@@ als to return and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served himself by the state . &quot;
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Fran@@ c@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind a th@@ ief in prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , not only as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , cutting @-@ edge and - inci@@ dentally - proph@@ etic speaker . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was , when he was vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of selling also the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he does not change tactics , but he does not turn off his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious man is criminal at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also similar : &quot;
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he sat 10 years and was free .
&quot; and today the company , in which he tre@@ ad money , is under the contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ ι@@ ς &quot; &quot; ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017 &quot;

Facebook is blocking the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wron@@ g@@ ly
&quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; means ch@@ ick@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ itting . &quot;
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Comm@@ ons , Creative Comm@@ ons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although still discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; in Bur@@ m@@ ese script &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radic@@ ally nation@@ alistic movements gave the word an extremely dissi@@ p@@ ative con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful contents on his platform . &quot;
&quot; &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word itself does not automatically call for hate speech . &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for its use have been cens@@ ored .
&quot; moreover , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings , which have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written to Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spl@@ itting legs ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Facebook user A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain by doing a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; &quot; cure &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were various reactions to Facebook &apos;s initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that they will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before it extingu@@ ishes all posts that are suspected of spreading rac@@ ism . &quot;
Facebook cle@@ ars the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it automatically filters the word .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write to Fac@@ t@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead , is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words by side . &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spl@@ itting legs ) .
&quot; the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists , spread hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise its nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to everyone , propag@@ ating hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not be long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have shown that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts , when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished by the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new rule of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to use the Li@@ ken , post and share content for 24 hours because the post &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech radic@@ ally nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author told his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words such as &quot; sto@@ ols &quot; or &quot; pe@@ as curr@@ y . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would give them a big turnover , it would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now am@@ using Facebook and deliberately write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which didn &apos;t include hate speech , but still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
just to try out if Facebook removes the post that contains the word Kal@@ ar .
screen@@ shot is used with permission .
&quot; if you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot is used with permission .
&quot; over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally heat the violence in the congregations in Myanmar , especially in the area Rak@@ h@@ ine , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to bring out the prolifer@@ ation of hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
&quot; but rather than simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to focus more on context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is an end to the chil@@ dr@@ ens

the chil@@ dr@@ ens are now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament unanim@@ ously approved a law that should prohi@@ bit this practice , so that the age of age is now 18 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( IR@@ O ) , gathered representatives of the various religious groups in the country that the state should not interfere , since that , age is not determining maturity . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Council , the min@@ ors as , each person under 18 years &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 indicate that the proportion of children who were married to 15 , was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements that endeav@@ oured to aboli@@ sh laws for chil@@ dr@@ ens , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no concerns to say to the critics of the chil@@ dr@@ ens , they should , to be dam@@ n about their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition ensured tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the chil@@ dr@@ ens - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law . &quot;
now only the president of the country must appro@@ ve and pro@@ claim the law .
&quot; one of the sen@@ ators of the country posted a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle has posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again : &quot;
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the chil@@ dr@@ ens was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and no one against it was decided .
&quot; once approved in the Senate , the draft may now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed because the laws of child@@ birth were finally changed .
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk that conce@@ aled the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the chil@@ dr@@ ens is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson is the opinion , it took definitely long enough to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally arrived : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , , Out@@ going News ! &quot;
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; torture Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group which openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft for the amend@@ ment of the married sp@@ ouses was decided today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 were present at the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties who were against have voted for the law .
the chil@@ dr@@ ens are no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ birth sign .
many thanks to all activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thanks to our MEPs .
&quot; however , a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organisation in the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj has proclaimed his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be passed , and he now seems to rede@@ em his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj appe@@ aled against the law , most social media users wished , one would approach the debate on the subject differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
&quot; rather sat , if we , instead of holding the discussion so general , in a way that would only evoke panic and dis@@ grace , if we , instead of talking about the problem that we , instead of talking about the problem , that the state , our daughters , may be mis@@ used , would you then be prepared to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , there are still places in the world where the child@@ birth in different levels is legal or still the norm , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them . &quot;

by mir@@ r@@ oring pages Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
&quot; the Wikipedia article was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally dark@@ ened . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than one month Turkey has now blocked the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day by day becomes clear@@ er how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series fight against the block@@ age .
&quot; although many techniques @-@ based internet users are used to use conversion tools for blocked web pages ( a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third biggest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking articles by Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the two most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centr@@ alised pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. hosts computer connections ) , which does not support the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; despite legal restrictions , the content is available . &quot;
IP@@ FS reports on his efforts in a blo@@ post :
&quot; after we heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in store snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the ability to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed ways . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.org . &quot;

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
&quot; a su@@ iting N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission .
&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him , never satisfied . &quot;
this motivated him to carry on a camera and try to gra@@ vit@@ ate the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar is trying to bring Nep@@ al@@ ese animals to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this prime situation helps him in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately began to kne@@ el pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and wants to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
&quot; and he should know it , for he rose tig@@ ers from face to face : &quot;
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of Bu@@ he@@ k appeared . he sits immediately , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for promoting Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ ter at Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could take a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations . &quot;
take a look at some of these photos below .

&quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India . &quot;
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid the greatest care to prono@@ unce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pr@@ on@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they should respect the husband because of the social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences , they should respect the norm to keep this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community after she had appe@@ aled to a married relationship with her name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also does not call on behalf , is also widespread among men . however , they have far less access to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health professionals and house@@ wives , became a unique club and thus became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and advoc@@ ates the exploitation of patri@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with the help of her video camera for seven years at the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s council to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads these clubs . &quot;
she reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion , acted by women who did not call their hus@@ bands on behalf . &quot;
she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify .
&quot; to prono@@ unce the name of their hus@@ bands , it is a custom that they owe all obligations and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not consider this , is considered to be dec@@ ep@@ tive , as a woman without morality . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply entr@@ en@@ ched that we never thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband so far , wanted to try out at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still remained silent after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him now by his name . &quot;
Roh@@ ini launched her first discussion with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she said all , &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does that mean that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day on which they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of an age @-@ old tradition , in which married women can never prono@@ unce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
a woman was so shy that she was only ch@@ oked during the whole exercise ; another decided to release all the stolen frustr@@ ations against him and his family by cur@@ sed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands on behalf . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women into her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it for dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law soli@@ di@@ fied her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less comprehen@@ sible and the situation generated in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead , which shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ y point if he did it too . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I ceased to wear it .
&quot; the other women did not complete with it , but think they are now in a better position to choose for themselves , not to carry it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip for each discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who could hear something , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in the last few months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have also talked about some things , for example , how our identi@@ ties are linked to our hus@@ bands , never so hon@@ estly . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have borne only sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; most of them is okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ty cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a p@@ ant , they have not dar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after much contro@@ versy and discussion about the benefits of their own choice of clothes , mor@@ als connected with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed their own couple of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ inhi@@ den ) in a discussion round so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is certain they will succeed . &quot;
&quot; to the question whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed somewhat , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly coming into the roll : &quot;
&quot; so far , we have only done small steps . &quot;
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then they stopped saying the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do it , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red at any time on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the f@@ eil@@ le for more freedom of movement or their own choice - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
as Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes home in the club and told other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; on 29 June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag in the Japanese Twitter trend was to be found where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot;
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war era .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , noticed in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
the people here have become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! it is today the Beat@@ les Day in Japan . for the past 51 years , they were here in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; also today , songs by the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English teaching at Japanese secondary schools . &quot;
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is the Beat@@ les Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the known places that relate to the band . &quot;
&quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely need to visit . &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( New York Memorial )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
&quot; 5 ) ( From link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool &quot;
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges sometimes cannot be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is the Beat@@ les Day .
&quot; just today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and went on the Abbey Road .
we did the same last year as well .
&quot; and of course , some companies also use the fan community in terms of market technology , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot;
and what could that be for a day ?
today I will listen to Y@@ esterday and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .
so the day will be lost today .
&quot; so , we hope you are there ! &quot;

bald @-@ headed men are de@@ ported and killed in Mozambique
the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia warned the people that gl@@ amor@@ ous men in Mozambique could be the target of attacks .

&quot; a new system of kid@@ n@@ apping of scra@@ per people for organ@@ ics , probably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , distur@@ bs the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the District of Mil@@ let , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and a part of the organs were taken from .
two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of sham@@ ans are used in Tanzania and Malawi .
&quot; there are local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on glass @-@ headed men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of kill@@ ings for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , are people with Al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 carried out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighboring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
&quot; respect to bald men who travel to Mozambique are the goal of ritual attacks , the Mos@@ ambi@@ an police warned of the latest assass@@ inations of three bald @-@ headed men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ let , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ ky Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and residents of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that sham@@ ans are involved in the death of bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of bald @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , for presum@@ ably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has been commissioned by the police of the Republic of Mozambique , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the sacrifices in the head would have power , the riches . &quot;
in the last days three men were murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
&quot; Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared on Facebook the Chron@@ icle of the Blog@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty that Mozambique faces : &quot;
&quot; I would like to take M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE like ON MO@@ SAM@@ BI@@ K , TH@@ AT S@@ ICH is ashamed of having sex against good marks , and others do not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country where the people would not hurt or even take their lives to get their bread , a country where neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or gl@@ amor@@ ous for ab@@ erg@@ ent purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted to get to quick wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ ren humor . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter users , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ ange , as well as the police spokes@@ person Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both gl@@ amor@@ ous : &quot;

a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia that was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents , Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the end of June . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demands democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the State Department in China called Li@@ us Fall as an &quot; &quot; internal affair &quot; &quot; and nar@@ rated a spokes@@ man that he considered it &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , China continues to authori@@ ze calls from the international community to release the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to permit him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from foreign countries .
United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad to be treated . &quot;
South Africa
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us Release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came into force after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations continued until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume the salmon farms to China , as the exports have largely been blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
due to his imprisonment he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
United States of America
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a decision in which China was called to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ us , as stated in an explanation on June 30 : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States
Terr@@ y Bran@@ stad told us that Americans &quot; want him to have the opportunity for treatment abroad in so far as it assi@@ sts him in his recovery .
&quot; a spokes@@ person for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the emb@@ assy asked the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the invitation of the US emb@@ assy drew a fur@@ ious answer from China to itself , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally . &quot;

Germany
&quot; the German spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , for Li@@ u to receive all the medical support he needed and that a humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese president Xi J@@ in@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing &apos;s news agency Reu@@ ters that China had large concerns whether the vor@@ tex could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide an appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues :
&quot; Canada is calling on China to protect its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release the exemp@@ tions for the exercise of these rights . &quot;

France &apos;s Foreign Ministry called for China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian grounds on 29 June :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information whether France will ultimately accept him . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; the Council of the mainland affairs in Taiwan required China to release Li@@ u on June 27 , and show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ature Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectu@@ als to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very much in an explanation on June 28 around Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for his well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished , would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and encouraged also when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 that stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was supposed to be considered a city . &quot;
this re@@ mark has spar@@ ked a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Association of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supported Singapore to be considered a city .
... no one questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; turn logic &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ it@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we hear that ultimately we are not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose land is it ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he was defending an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries , &quot; in the face of that , it seemed inevitably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently run by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re emerged from the author@@ it@@ arian rulers who pret@@ end to be democr@@ ats , leaving the distor@@ ted logic , as it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ responses . &quot;
he asked questions in a rational manner with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; when Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ te would take the effort to clarify this point , if he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by publishing his comment on the blog , he points out to critics that you should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that you can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the inscription .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities have seen a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said , &quot; &quot; Be not a country , &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam as a leader of a growing generation that makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
&quot; at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what I expected - if I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he really believes and is aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review disman@@ tle the weaknesses of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; believed a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a joy of joy ? &quot;
&quot; when Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country will the sovereign rights of the city go back ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is both land and city . &quot;
&quot; since it plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore pay their military service , but do they not defend their city , but not their country ? &quot;
who has to pay back our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot;
I haven &apos;t said what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; the defense of the country above all &quot; , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country or homeland ?
their answers are published here as part of a continuous series with the rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question I am most asked in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry , I answer . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Ro@@ cky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans cook perhaps in@@ war@@ dly against anger if they are held for Americans , but don &apos;t anno@@ y me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distinguishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans make a Canadian flag visible on their back@@ pack if they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel through the world twenty years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn small map@@ le leaves at their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
gender marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; obviously , we often say &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends that I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; it wouldn &apos;t matter to me , if one would switch to Johnny from Dallas for example . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : being called &quot; nice &quot; means to be fun - just like the ben@@ ign , gentle but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; Die S@@ imp@@ sons &quot; ( who has their own Canadian double @-@ worker ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nett &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing that can be encountered . &quot;
being harmless means in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not to earn attention .
&quot; this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major property of the Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps simply cool pol@@ it@@ eness . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence along with the neighbors .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada down@@ right sexy . &quot;
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ ert Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
&quot; a pop band famous in Thailand has published a music video that par@@ o@@ unces the j@@ un@@ ta , which in 2014 took power and despite its promise , restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells what prec@@ ep@@ ts his girl@@ friend makes .
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video is indirectly related to the continuing military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was a huge success .
&quot; in the first three days alone , the Video 1.@@ 254 was shared on Facebook and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; Der dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it deals with the situation of the country under the j@@ un@@ ta rule . &quot;
take a look at these videos that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ic section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the commander of the army absolute decision @-@ making on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the &quot; setting change &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are viewed by the Jun@@ ta as a critic . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and uncle@@ ar rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activ@@ ist and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , who over@@ sees online content and accused persons accused of having perpet@@ u@@ ated the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; Thailand sets a strict program against &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; ( maj@@ esty of the maj@@ esty ) . &quot;
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
&quot; two days later , it came to a coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an inter@@ ni@@ cation facility , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened by long pen@@ alties , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song became members of the band that im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society only reco@@ vers slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now more than 20 years have passed since the Georgi@@ an @-@ ab@@ ch@@ astic war has been officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ ht@@ a , Poly@@ ana and Khar@@ chil@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ pool of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , Ab@@ sch@@ asi@@ an , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together on Soviet sites in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , most of the Russians and n@@ oses live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16@@ ,000 people after having barely asc@@ ended over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 43.@@ 000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; all is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ uk@@ ow@@ ka , are symbo@@ lically representing the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are fallen and quite rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts talking and it is difficult for him to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it is nevertheless unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that served all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with blowing mag@@ nific@@ ence buildings .
people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha approximately fifty inhabitants live .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages , it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ ch@@ ov@@ ka , which still houses one or two families , is recognized by the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately pull back . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girl@@ friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) , such as livestock , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable growing . &quot;
it is difficult to get over the l@@ aps .
&quot; in winter , the district administration supplies candles and bread to the villages free of charge . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago , an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or aunt G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left off Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will forever remain in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; she tells . &quot;
&quot; Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter , and she insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead . &quot;
Gal@@ ina monthly rent is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you neither have a vegetable garden or a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; she says . &quot;
aunt G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A tells us that they and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; when holidays are , we visit ourselves . &quot;
but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ AL@@ Y@@ A to her . &quot; they said we could build Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ing partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remind themselves of the village life before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mines .
the young family has their own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ ascha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and ch@@ ick@@ ens . &quot;

&quot; we have no fear of the dark street or the few people .
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has rather something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and everyone lived as it was right .
I remember every day how the city and the war once were .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot;

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org on 19 April 2017 and appears here with kind permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula . it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican act@@ ress , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bear . &quot;
it is called Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2.50 dollars a night , guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - but there are hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants .
&quot; sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells , people get into full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cart@@ ons . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medications that they can &apos;t pay , they massage them with a bal@@ sam the fet@@ us exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bar@@ t ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
Foto : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to take normal a first stop in South America and then move towards the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans are often travelling the circuit together and that Afri@@ cans already speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weak@@ ened , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; he answers sm@@ iling . &quot; we will always be in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests to send her often text messages when they are gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
it declares that their Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of their work .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the town a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have included migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to many African immigrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a kitchen outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests undergo .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants , who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children from people who wanted to sque@@ eze money from him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single person , has offered him its roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
&quot; in the cor@@ rid@@ ors , the traveler quietly cons@@ ults their teleph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic for those who have gone away . &quot;
like a proud grand@@ mother she bl@@ ends her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair bra@@ ids , who made her a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laugh@@ s sad while she presents her briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; repe@@ ats them every time . &quot; they have gone . &quot;

&quot; on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city Ur@@ um@@ qi received a phone notification in which they address the district government , a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the communication , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities tended to use the app for more than fighting terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested at the Autonom@@ ous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; the police said that the app would identify and persec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
&quot; the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend it online and remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with filters for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or ste@@ al the home network of a person . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reporting about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focuses on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often d@@ ü@@ ster@@ er for those who live in remote , repres@@ sed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme z@@ ens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet ab@@ sten@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; the media outlet , based on Twitter , &quot; Images from my China &quot; ( the &quot; &quot; Energie@@ plan &quot; &quot; ) , published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a checkpoint , at which polic@@ eman checked the residents in@@ discrimin@@ ately if they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that the people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are discovered in a Check@@ point with a device without this software , you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the control technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from &quot; &quot; China &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; Deutsch &quot; &quot; ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can raise the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones will become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang . &quot;
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the directions of the City Party Council to minimize the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and the party related facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office when operating their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of Ur@@ um@@ qi , a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs , until August 1 , their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible off@@ ences , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : all scre@@ ams after death &quot;
one single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world , you look at you and find that you are alone in a place where everything is gone . &quot;
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth which clearly recognis@@ es both internally and extern@@ ally .
one that makes all honour to their name .
one that has defeated in a list of feelings and expressions that don &apos;t allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality reco@@ vers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and all scre@@ ams for death . &quot;
&quot; all doubt arises in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even though the Earth is turning on the axis of evil . it becomes clear that you are caught here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone . &quot;
&quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he showed his power over us by destroying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; it was sufficient for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; all the neighbor@@ hoods were cov@@ eted , but my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , it was quiet , no rain , at the wrong time , even though I did not put high demands on a city that is up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces . &quot;
in the third night things had cal@@ med down after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning .
&quot; I broke through the silence , by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot;
I heard my voice resist@@ ed by the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt cour@@ age@@ ous enough to find together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined us to a magnificent image that filled my expectations fully and completely . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you realize that you release the spirit out of the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; do you ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot;
he put up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low down - nothing can give you your voice , after giving you all the way to the office of the security service out of the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was there , as I was now . &quot;
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak , &quot; &quot; Let me hear how you cry out &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not near . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; and you really trust what to look into my eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was at my fol@@ ly , vanity , perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my thing when I replied : &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I never stopped looking to see you in my eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I do not regret that which I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement , and his father with it . &quot;
&quot; his father equ@@ als with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the st@@ ench of this accur@@ sed sentence is up to this day in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a spiritual torture I was exposed for months . &quot;
I crossed the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
then back through the yard and into the second office that leads through a gang to the individual cells .
I conc@@ eive all details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably have allocated a larger cell to me this time .
&quot; I have to share them with only one more prisoner , and I must immediately place myself without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell and I went back to an old @-@ tried communication method : to beat the f@@ ist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my Z@@ ellen@@ ic fin was a &quot; &quot; self @-@ help &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me finally .
&quot; apparently none of the surrounding cells was a resp@@ ectable middle aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; Doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , no distinctive facial features can be recognized , and doctors are not there ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ?
all the answers are linked to their existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the large cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would leave him free if I stay . &quot;
li@@ ars .
I would have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to exp@@ el all these crow@@ s that are in the garden of my head .
&quot; from af@@ ar , I still hear them &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time , the cri@@ es , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that sur@@ rendered to us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( say , &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ chor@@ age on 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to hear .
&quot; thus , the secret was : to protect the state security against us and prevent us from releasing the tra@@ itor and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their conf@@ essi@@ onal press card and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world view . &quot;
here is not a house that is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their sound into a hero .
&quot; I supervised the hearing room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and stock@@ y man ; at least he seems to me . &quot;
&quot; he cat@@ ches a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that escap@@ es him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life as you join those days and protest on demonstrations that will soon find an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I used it to me to not answer .
I can really no longer say when ins@@ ults and beats have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly chat .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; any voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I did nothing to earn this penalty . &quot;
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the clo@@ aking .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your scre@@ ams .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot keep your cry . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams didn &apos;t suit him yet enough , which is why they exchanged the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked as a gar@@ bage collector before or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still on the line .
&quot; I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped crying . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down , and didn &apos;t find favor on it , which is why he was next to an electrically charged rod . &quot;
&quot; power flows through my entire body , enough to supply my whole district . &quot;
&quot; my half @-@ naked body lying on the ground , was the perfect conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; some hours passed , which seemed to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ass@@ fu@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and get you , you will be mis@@ placed . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they always had me free .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smoking a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he nar@@ rows to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his with ni@@ cot@@ ine stain@@ ed lips .
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s family had been forced to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived in Palestine ( e.g. : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their old @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the whole Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with its 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as someone who is not limited by borders in his thinking , and he can feel at home with the people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special incl@@ ination against the US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation , &quot; he said , even though he was born in Jordan and never was in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; says H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; while he dissolved in water , Nes@@ cafe sh@@ ook into two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the blows of lu@@ k@@ ew@@ arm coffee and the check@@ ers of the K@@ ent cigar@@ ette in the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially if you have a look at the neighboring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan waters - to avoid landing in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Ministry of Interior of Jordan said a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la , for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front singer , Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contra@@ di@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert . &quot;
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former spokes@@ persons of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ u@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; just &quot; was cancelled because of sexual orientation of the singer .
&quot; many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which demand the old @-@ proven legitim@@ acy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la rated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to advoc@@ ate an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement probably should not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan that clearly appears in H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b recovered from traditional sex organs by losing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently ble@@ ached woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
it is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
&quot; in recent years , Jordan has increased the number of &quot; Hon@@ orary Citiz@@ ens &quot; - the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ our kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still shock@@ ing that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure in order to support women , victims , murder or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of in@@ tra @-@ family violence may be held at an in@@ definite time in prison , and for their release there is often a long @-@ term bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee provided by the family that the woman is not going to happen . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s music also enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been tab@@ oo in his country .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but assumes that he puts his music , which is full of explicit assur@@ ances on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , cannot separate from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics was inti@@ mid@@ ated by me , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b tac@@ kles the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of the songs that are political in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse often repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words &quot; what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he noted that hardly anybody speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still heavily cens@@ ored in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Y@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya in order to note that his comments were torn from context , twi@@ sted and cens@@ ored in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but was stre@@ amed but only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and advoc@@ ates that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not speak to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ ts , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to its homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ i , who later was to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ an@@ ier not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
there is nothing new in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic realm that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence service took several former government representatives and members of the teaching alliance , with the reason they had comments on comment@@ aries in social media cri@@ tically to the problems associated with the corruption rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the show H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ier . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has managed to conduct a show for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s how it looks like H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and inner changes . it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs , from an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is approached by music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bombs , street uni@@ tions and artificial kind of democr@@ ati@@ zing demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until it is ready , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue and therefore also resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ ri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; one assumes that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the stron@@ gh@@ olds , drums and dancing were mar@@ ched over more than a thousand years , to force the indigenous population of the region , the Emis@@ hi , to its knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab a few great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a community center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fort@@ resses are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and yet another stunning way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ high fortress was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange arms against sc@@ iss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

outw@@ ard@@ ly outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dres@@ ser .
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street smo@@ kers and illegal drug traff@@ icking are daily . &quot;
&quot; Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance , and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired a yearly event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which takes place since 2014 . &quot;
experts play against each other in order to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( other videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
&quot; educational institutions such as the school of August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who are located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive education in hair@@ dressing tools instead of bad advice that allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and offering opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of her achievements : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community from love to the children . &quot;
Colombia : letter of love to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters

the following article is the edited version of the message &quot; Liebes@@ messenger to Guer@@ ill@@ ac@@ rob@@ bers , &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who feel exp@@ elled to accommodate aff@@ ection ? &quot;
this was exactly the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists of Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ ación ( Let@@ ters on Rec@@ on@@ ciliation ) that encourage young people to write letters of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
&quot; only recently , their country was setting a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the Guer@@ ill@@ ab@@ out@@ weighing F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the sig@@ nat@@ ory of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
but there is still a long way in front of the Colom@@ bian people until one can speak of true reconciliation and peace .
&quot; Gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were subjected to war rhet@@ oric and , around the clock , had to integrate themselves into the lives of civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian company , in turn , which had become ac@@ custom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , must now engage in their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that young Colum@@ bian people had to join together and to help with the integration process .
&quot; and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society . &quot;
the target of the campaign is 69@@ 00 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa fighter - which is to be handed over personally .
the Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letter of reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to speak shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we love the people we love , on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , write thousands of love letters , but those who need them much more necessary . &quot;
&quot; he plan , he continued to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response . &quot;
&quot; so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support to former F@@ ARC fighters who now have to find their place in society and to build a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian company is ready to make the discourse of a war story into a common history of peace , &quot; &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I never thought someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation travelled to the camp to transfer the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC decided how they had done it earlier to accept the commands of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings one can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything in between , &quot; the policy student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila told later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we handed over the letters , a former war@@ rior took me through the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ er@@ illa fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go , because beside him on the bed lay a M@@ GL @-@ Pom@@ eg@@ row@@ er , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; I answered him anyway and said , &quot; &quot; Hi , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life somebody has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; then suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I embra@@ ced him completely and sat down next to the pom@@ eg@@ row@@ ers .
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , I was sorry to be all the years of loyal companions of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never expected something different from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to protect him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society outside that wa@@ its for us with open arms .
until now I have learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; at the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC organised a panel discussion . &quot;
the students were all raised up as already war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
&quot; that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC announced the history of the organization , its ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; to hear those people who have never experienced hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that people I have often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful emotions , which were turned around by their circumstances and their surroundings , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
but it comforts me that all people - including those who killed and caused so much damage to teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the camp command@@ ant of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example the Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bian was prophes@@ ied that after dis@@ arm@@ ament peace would rule .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people who are willing to attack and protest for their rights , and this is also fully justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call upon all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; gay and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with horror , activists have witnessed the recent months reporting on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat posed by the LGB@@ T@@ Q community over the LGB@@ T@@ Q community has not been created overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports were published containing the deport@@ ation , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested suspic@@ ious men and arrested them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since childhood , she felt that she was actually a woman . &quot;
&quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was no safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen from the sexual equ@@ ation of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
her life moved to the USA out of fear for her life .
Sab@@ rina : I was working as an honorary hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a acquain@@ tance of Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone , of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there &apos;s no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the round about the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you still want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you Sch@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and wo@@ ke up again in the hospital .
apparently some women had gotten everything along and started to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two s@@ ore s@@ ore in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which cases were you placed - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated because my male name is still on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful to him .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being resp@@ ect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they asked absurd demands : some said to me , I had to prove it by running up without the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex that all was just bad @-@ talk , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have seeds size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has not only cor@@ rupted your family , but the entire Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she put herself a kn@@ ack around her neck .
luckily the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later under the window stood a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it .
&quot; after it happened to the third time , it became clear to me that something was la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without registering myself , without notice , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the gar@@ bage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I plu@@ cked the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think about security , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you are in . you even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about sexual equ@@ ation , that &apos;s a tab@@ oo subject . &quot;
some traditional Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an elements I still wear in me .
&quot; as much as I desire , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best in order not to hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really try to look at how the person looks at which she rec@@ alls from her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed behind ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : last week I submitted a report to Washington .
&quot; for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I spoke to someone who has imprisoned one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told us that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock up a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
&quot; I mean , they probably invite the relatives who care about the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are still gay men held in these myst@@ eries ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend tells me that there would be not very many .
&quot; if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to settle Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they had attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but deliberately immersed in order to radic@@ alise themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is that just a guess or have you a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard grew .
there has been nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person himself was there when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports about it yet . we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know if these persec@@ utions and kid@@ n@@ app@@ ings of people , which belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , have already taken place in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , before 2003 I was already known throughout Gros@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia wanted to introduce us to the &quot; &quot; Ci@@ vili@@ zation &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore jeans Jeans and short tops . &quot;
the security ministry of Sh@@ aria has never curved me a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people met there . &quot;
we have never been off@@ ended .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language , there is a saying : Khar@@ da ma Khar@@ da . that means : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often said to children if they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they simply closed their eyes before you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never har@@ med me , never hun@@ ted and never sm@@ itten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace time last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began talking about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he spoke not about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could sense how people started to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; he who had guar@@ ded and laugh@@ ed before , looked at once with suspic@@ ion . &quot;
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
OC Media : what activity are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ff , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get out of ess@@ ences . &quot;
I don &apos;t have a cent for it .
I discovered these people myself when I cli@@ pped cu@@ bs .
I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
&quot; so is nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to show you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no gay amongst them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have those who have cab@@ ard@@ ines which , the Russians also have ; on the whole planet , they are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant to listen to that . &quot;
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims walking in the mos@@ que and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think at Transi@@ tion to men who love men and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different ways of feeling , in order to be accurate , different attitude settings . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and do not harm me for my body . &quot;
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry that I will be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not very sad at all - I just know that I am myself now .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide in the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong increase in suicide . &quot;
the photograph of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ avi@@ i on 27 August ru@@ ined the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is characterized by poverty and unemployment , in the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness to be able to pay the in@@ capacity for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who work and remain anonymous in Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube took the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ i@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could no longer do anything . &quot;
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i minority , and activists warn against the fact that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab B@@ ani Tam@@ im - was hanging . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers , who felt hel@@ pless and in@@ capable of feeding their families and going on a safe work because of the persecution by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ ra@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region in which a majority of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community live in Iran has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to deny its livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power and under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and priv@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime den@@ ies the Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i @-@ Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil , gas , and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s that surround the waters from the Arab areas to the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are located . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ zi young people rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for co @-@ operation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , 55 % completed secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian A@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist based in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mix of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
&quot; because of this , a combination of a high number of ethnic Persi@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the adjustment process is a combination of a high number of ethnic and anti @-@ Arab discrimination . &quot;
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i is depri@@ ved of access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ih@@ oods outside their homes of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ mad@@ az@@ i , as even Arab names in the workplace are not toler@@ ated , let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances given by the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , human rights activists kill alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to wait for the world to wake up and take note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism even with inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als
detail of a photo . added by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Comm@@ ons license .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website .
you can be read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should generally be female femin@@ ists .
&quot; for example , women still earn less money despite equal education than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and fai@@ ths . &quot;
all of this is aware and well @-@ known .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and thre@@ e@@ fold .
I am a black woman .
&quot; yet : when I come to speak on skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black women women , on black women in the LGB@@ T community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention whatever kind we have been ab@@ used physically , emotion@@ ally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists decide to silence in white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; &quot; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &quot; , &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist motivated violence that we are faced with black women in two ways . &quot;
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and countries of origin deserve less than white men and women .
&quot; black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk , suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join myself as a black woman who ref@@ uses to consider injus@@ tices in their thinking that relate to both the gender and skin colour of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere who has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in 1851 in her speech : &quot; &quot; am I no woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical point a terrible and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping of skin colour and gender , because some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for a better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women from different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism and to join me to the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever before we define black women according to our own ideas and move into spheres that are created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ourselves ( such as : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ ani@@ anism : how we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) , that we can defend ourselves in this way , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which constitute the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradig@@ m I exist . &quot;
I am recognized as a part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blossom in an environment where my life is neither passed , nor ignored . &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; To@@ dd Reu@@ bold &apos;s contribution was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine reported in@@ particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled again and again over the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern by the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . its mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his church .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development led to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ epers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was fil@@ med , fil@@ med and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film director and multimedia journalist in Er@@ bil , Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work lies on trac@@ ing , little appreci@@ ative sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with whose help supp@@ ressed churches can tell their stories in their way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence

the article is the shor@@ tened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ tural .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her spouse , who had become violent against her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be placed on the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena for abuse , the know@@ led@@ geable ad of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was not useful . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second wife drew back her ad . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women are instruc@@ ted at all , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women , who admit to be victims of violence , compl@@ ain at all with the prosecution authorities . &quot;
&quot; inhal@@ ts@@ 1 Stri@@ kes and Statisti@@ cs@@ 2 In@@ visible ab@@ uses and a legal system , which has nothing inferior to Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , flaw@@ ed implementation beats and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to find out how many women are really mal@@ treated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; there are various indications and reports that show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; however , the available figures are al@@ ar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the District Prosec@@ ution filed 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads at the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the courts of peace . here too 86 % of women &apos;s ads came .
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minist@@ ress Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; on every woman who ref@@ uses in Paraguay for mental ill @-@ treatment , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; any woman who ref@@ uses for physical abuse will come to two women who do not do this , &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ense , the prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; only until August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of genocide in the country . &quot;
the coordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men .

invisible mal@@ treatment and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do it , but then she did . this should be regre@@ t@@ table for ever . &quot;
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time most recognizable :
I would never have thought that I would once become victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they let themselves be dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why she had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier . &quot;
it seemed almost as if they would say that victims of abuse should at least have a certain complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who was not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was ill @-@ treated her . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything started with mental abuse .
her prosper@@ ous partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as ads with the authorities remained without a result , and also from their relatives , she did not receive support . &quot;
&quot; it led a process against her former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach to flaw@@ ed implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was deb@@ ated in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # für@@ st ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non Ein@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ izi@@ d is to be declared a stand @-@ alone criminal and pun@@ ish as it is the case already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; in some respects , the legislative text has been changed in order to win the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions that are generally banned in Paraguay and are being punished with up to five years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the original bill fores@@ aw , the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs , which must be borne by the victims of violence at the present time , if they just want to furnis@@ h an ad and would like to receive a safe place to raise the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
&quot; in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer seen as normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates and contributes to the fact that the perpet@@ rators will escape . &quot;
we have to make a long ad until ill @-@ treatment is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been altered . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the filing of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;
this article is the shor@@ tened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ tural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # sof@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ sm ) which reports on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .

independent media resi@@ ding in Oman one year after prohibition of a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website has been banned because of a decision of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; is to be read on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Afgh@@ an authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its coverage of corruption in the sult@@ an . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he is a one @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and placed before court , but later returned . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had dismis@@ sed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; in addition to his role as the only sult@@ an , the most important mini@@ stries in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the Sult@@ an is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular the state sec@@ rec@@ y , public fre@@ edoms , including freedom of press , restric@@ ting and det@@ ained human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and hin@@ der citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused the ruling of the Supreme Court of Oman under pressure to raise a verdi@@ ct in an inheritance dispute . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editorial committee , was invited by the ISS in front of the special department and arrested by the security forces upon his arrival . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS served as editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed at an in@@ definite time after the Minister of Information had given the directive that &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the paper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 prohibited . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place before the court in Mas@@ kat . &quot;
the court den@@ o@@ unced the three journalists in prison and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned by distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the state . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of a ban on the public and the sl@@ anders .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
&quot; al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) , after making use of &quot; an information network for the dis@@ semination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a damage deposit of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was fixed and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , Al @-@ Ha@@ j condemned Al @-@ Abr@@ i to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari sentenced to six months in prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison where he is sentenced to prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to res@@ ign , the newspaper is still exposed to attacks by the Korean government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued a directive with which the closing of &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; was extended by three additional months , and thus the minister presented another time against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to revi@@ ve the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the press freedom was viol@@ ated in the most recent times .
&quot; other injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to end the comprehensive violation of the press freedom . &quot;
&quot; Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) , the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities : &quot;
1 . share You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
&quot; 2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work ; &quot;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances , ensuring that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work , and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including legal ch@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , figure takes place with his consent &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
&quot; there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : firstly , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing in the offer of the global healthcare system that cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have much more serious effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research conducted by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for the Research of Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic revealed first serious effects on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he studied himself at the HIV virus before he decided to go back home in order to support the Libyan health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work lies on the application of research results . in doing so , I support the sam@@ bian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; in addition , I just set a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ ogens . &quot;
what are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed somewhere else .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain benef@@ ici@@ aries instead of being makers . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not well used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GM : where does financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently well .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
GM : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not conform to standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory equipment is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special academic training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and inf@@ ectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from this . &quot;
&quot; GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines can only make available against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine published about solutions for environmental problems around the world . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding let@@ tu@@ ce in the US since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ doors , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by its own resour@@ c@@ eful@@ ness and the question of how many kinds of let@@ tu@@ ce can be obtained . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents do not only apply to individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been registered for more and more plants such as grain or card types . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a m@@ illen@@ nia tradition , Mort@@ on still breeds a salad , but it needs no longer , since his work is increasingly complicated by increasing restrictions . &quot;
it is as if in a river a rock bro@@ o@@ cks are lying around which I must p@@ add@@ ling .
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the tradition of breeding , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go far too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed a new type of salad because all the features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very cau@@ tious and stri@@ ves to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he also joined a movement growing in the United States and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red red@@ dish salad in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( &quot; Open Source &quot; seed initiative ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
&quot; it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ SS@@ I , US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds that they were bred . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; breeders simply allow others who buy their seeds to breed them , and not immediately select - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
sc@@ aff@@ old prospects
&quot; Professor at University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ SS@@ I board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg include control over seed and the possibility of breeding new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; as a result , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg empha@@ sizes that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not concern gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants may be patented , whether vegetable , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seed , as it is for example on farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without food sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing to provide others with their seeds , in contrast to pat@@ enting seed and plant features . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus increasingly available , is un@@ interrupted . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ SS@@ I , has occupied herself with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; such estimates do not exist for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are patented in an even larger style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are bred so that they are specifically desirable characteristics - from such , through which their taste or colour is improved up to such , because of which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders dimin@@ ishes through more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before , since the changed conditions are much worse by climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ person Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; however , it contra@@ di@@ cts that intellectual property uses other breeders because &quot; patents and the protection of plant variations are promoting innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
&quot; thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly no innovation . &quot;
&quot; if one had to wait for such a long time to breed on plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the struggle . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders do not have the time or money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us forward , and it will be impossible for us if we do not continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; overall Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; &quot; we do not really create the features themselves . &quot;
the plants form it themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state Oregon and O@@ SS@@ I board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breeds one type , also breeds its own values into it . &quot;
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures are required to cultivate mass @-@ wise her@@ b@@ ici@@ des to grow in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is just gent@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such , who are moving on international markets but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the pattern or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant owner Frank Mort@@ on looks for salads in his breeding garden .

&quot; Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eder would innov@@ ate by avoiding plant patents : &quot; &quot; it looks like I &apos;m with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patented . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; with a patent you are protected against competition for 20 years . &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly across the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . &quot;
it also helps them to reach &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
the German organisation Agre@@ col is working on an open source license which is ultimately a more formal and legally binding form of the O@@ SS@@ I commitment to bre@@ eder in the European Union .
&quot; ( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , why the O@@ SS@@ I obligation cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; in early November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; it is now on the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os held a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa come together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend to pat@@ enting seed . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems declares that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , for which scheduled for the next year will be the official starting signal . &quot;
&quot; a merger of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the International Non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - has published a report from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . &quot;
&quot; the report also highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a connection from the Lu@@ by of O@@ SS@@ I hopes that more people will soon be recognized . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has largely paid attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have barely played a role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still prohi@@ bit content on the internet .
this time the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist met .
&quot; on the weekend around the 5th of August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published a comment on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true to its goal , despite this attack and the mo@@ cking of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law , to pass violations in this part of the world and to give victims a voice . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites over two months ago , for example the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the network of Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era in Qatar because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for spreading colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles , which he writes for web pages and media in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he set up to deal with the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the target of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , which is also native to Zi@@ adas blog , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video as the police practi@@ sed physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the blogs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and although the blocking of blogs might not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has managed to convey to me the feeling of a si@@ ege , an arrest , a temp@@ ted murder , an invitation to the national security council , the blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) They have shown that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , though only on a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used to post items to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; but now , having blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave walk the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities opened 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . these were technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and E@@ ti@@ let@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers , by transferring intern@@ ships and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ PN@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , 12 June , we noticed how the blocking of web pages , the V@@ PN@@ s , began . &quot;
such practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering the contents of the Egyptian users .
&quot; the situation is also exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which they can proceed against these acts against these acts . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and whom will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .
&quot; Brazilian troops deployed in the F@@ av@@ elas in Nit@@ er@@ ó@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis . &quot;

&quot; day after day newspapers throughout Brazil report dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous post@@ cards . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; E@@ very second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro has assass@@ inated &quot; &quot; th@@ iev@@ es rob@@ bing pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio achieved the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice called even the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these have become comm@@ on@@ place and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; the &quot; Extra &quot; newspaper published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on August 16 , published the editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper so :
&quot; there will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything , however , devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the category &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists don &apos;t close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , explained that this decision is not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war effort in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper declares that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , when it is distor@@ ted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police who first sho@@ ots and then asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption by the police , whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argu@@ es to design@@ ate violence as a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as shown in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with inadequate investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ pleasing negl@@ ect of public service . &quot;
remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital .

&quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data available . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the mur@@ ders per state , Rio is at No. 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; the company Glob@@ o is one of the largest media companies in South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia has under@@ lined , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years . &quot;
&quot; these security policy measures included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit imposed by the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a F@@ av@@ ela by using a massive police station and permanently station@@ ing it there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease in violent deaths . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles in 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio does not conform to the criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to use means and ways which are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; , &quot; where a zi@@ vi@@ list is an unknown point in the landscape and becomes the object for &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; lost balls &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war or her , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ elas in Rio continue to suffer . &quot;
&quot; a week ago , the police had climbed up the hill with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ ar@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a police officer . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit seller died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal sieg@@ es and block@@ ages , mainly by Assad &apos;s regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute , The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the investigation of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of the Assad regime has been perpet@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these areas controlled by rebels have been under si@@ ege outside Damascus , which led to the need for local residents or through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; due to the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as inhabitants as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ low@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the traditional , cultivated food in Syria and are only very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Direc@@ torate of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said vis @-@ à @-@ vis the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose the cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed his relief that it is now gaining more and more awareness . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , use the humanitarian crowd funding platform cand@@ o in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ low@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge about pl@@ anting pil@@ ates , so Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of about 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to cand@@ o by Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel scar@@ city , locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began the &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds &quot; from the regions before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after further 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a greater movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; : frac@@ ture of si@@ ege . &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; distribution of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee kit , cart@@ on , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and si@@ ege will be visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese claim justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
&quot; on 21 October , several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires ra@@ ving in the north of Portugal in the week before . &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ two persons died , and some 70 were injured following the forest fires of the 15th and 16th October . this led to the fact that the government called for the last week out of solidarity with the victims for three days . &quot;
&quot; fires have also been registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 dead . &quot;
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire erup@@ tions spreading in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite pictures alone , about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in 2017 alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon District . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of seri@@ ousness : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; all of Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a , ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15th October , 2017 &quot;

numerous videos spread on the web and show images that allow better insights into the action :
the fores@@ e@@ eable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prev@@ ent@@ ative and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão sover@@ al from the federal government of the farmers of Portugal declared the paper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere else : there are dozens of open streets that were enclosed by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , building permits in locations with high fire risk will be questioned . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the wh@@ ale form , which the government introduced to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity from case to case if the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continues to carry on in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Quer@@ cus pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees from easily combus@@ tible wood , are spreading like in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this species . &quot;
&quot; to these problems , the website of the civil defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as inhabitants sought information or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the people with information : they used their own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial that the servers did not withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

&quot; in one night in the fall of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had conquered the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belonged to the eth@@ ni@@ cal group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan , sat together for the last time with his family during dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother was not so told at that time , she knew she would no longer see her son - maybe even more . &quot;
in the dawn the young should break .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the hau@@ lers .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been killed by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt vulnerable . &quot;
the Taliban known for their hate came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country toward Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found herself in Pakistan . &quot;
he worked in a coal mine for a few years . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mort@@ ars that were he@@ avier than he himself in order to earn his livel@@ ihood . &quot;
&quot; at that time , like today , Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran were characterized by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked . &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we hung nylon from the open windows so that we do not fre@@ eze at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , ran only through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church , who distributed food to the need@@ y twice a day . &quot;
&quot; it is true that , due to relatively high level of growth rates , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is true that the conditions of asylum seek@@ ers in the country are dis@@ astro@@ us . &quot;
the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they officially submitted an application to asylum - which can go for months after the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
&quot; but his un@@ bi@@ ased life expect@@ ant helped A@@ shar@@ k , soon to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions . &quot;
&quot; after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ k put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
it worked so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some of Afgh@@ ans run businesses , including tail@@ ors , travel agents , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the chefs were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of her trip to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ an .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals , however , extend far beyond the Italian gastronomic trade and retail and aim back to the country which he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , there are also opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people suffer .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; this way , they can sell their harvest excess on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now , he would like to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path . &quot;
&quot; citizen Report : bill from Egypt to cut off social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in custo@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el Ada@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen Report is an international snapshot , showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
the Egyptian parliament checks a bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority .
&quot; users would have to register to use social networks within six months of submission on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number . &quot;
those who missed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of prison sentence or susp@@ ending punishment .
&quot; the law , which was promoted by sixty members of the Parliament , is present under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , a further member of Parliament submitted a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the President or a High Commissioner . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the off@@ ence of the President and state institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the legislation , such a deed would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of expression has been in danger already for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he was expos@@ ing violence against demonstr@@ ators , who demonstrated violence against the military coup that led to the dism@@ iss@@ al of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 prot@@ esters arrested at the same incident , four years in jail for a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently his trial was postpon@@ ed on May 20 , because the prison administration failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty because of a so many human rights groups agree , head@@ light of among others arms , illegal assembly , murder and mis@@ erable murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si sit block@@ ade at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ada@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunis@@ ian activists h@@ ears usi@@ ve documents
&quot; in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices advoc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated by the President of the Republic , which according to the plan explicitly supports a controversial bill that would warran@@ t business@@ men and during the former regime by the dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided that they return all un@@ lawful mon@@ ies . &quot;
the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on 21 April raises a light on how the pre@@ si@@ di@@ cal plans to support the legislation .
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia denied the attri@@ bution of his sources , stating articles 11 of the Tunis@@ ian Press Code , which journalists have the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he entered the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to present their ID ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share news in social media . &quot;
in the regulations it is also stated that the registration will be required with the full re@@ direct name .
analysts assume that thereby the elimination of anonymous comments is to be achieved within social networks . it is until now uncle@@ ar how the authorities apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to impose these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect ci@@ vic journ@@ alism and independence .
&quot; do we see ourselves in &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia closed access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat , in the state government , has to register as &quot; organis@@ er of information prolifer@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this term is part of a law dating back to 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government handles a list of online services that provide the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law allows the government to make responsible services responsible for removing content and to force them on request to susp@@ end user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ ś@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish tri@@ bunal has blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court had wi@@ ped Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia Administrator has refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the particulars , Turkey supported the ji@@ hadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication provided that the site was blocked because it becomes &quot; a source of information that co@@ operates with groups in order to inc@@ ite a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is thus , among other things China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain can &apos;t stop kno@@ cking down
&quot; after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance authorities that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that encryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications enterprises and intelligence services related to the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from the members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
