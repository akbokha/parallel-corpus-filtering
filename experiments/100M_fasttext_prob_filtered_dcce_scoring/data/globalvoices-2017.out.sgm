<seg id="1">"although I visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love of America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, dancing American music, reading American authors and running his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound impact on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who wanted to occupy the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate as a Jura student, who wanted to occupy the Supreme Court with judges who were inclined to his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free after Method Man," I was, as if it is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," "America is the only country I've ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very dirty love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"with his view, he never stops behind the mountain, as one says so beautifully."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague expresses it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmericans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and tuned in pairs for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won in the republican elections, was the highest number ever seen by the party nominated by the party."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans, who support this bigot person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, which takes people from around the world, a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"likewise, Trumps did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current publisher of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who struggled for the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits to Kristi Kappes's commitment, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leaks, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump hired his way to the nominated republican presidential candidate, she gave me a halt and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception to rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly whites, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were prepared to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to categorize people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to elevate a man who looks from contempt to those who look different than he."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(pm. from Ü): as much as" "elongation of the whites against all other ethnics" "; word play from white in reference to the whites and Whiplash, as the great Van Jones called, has exactly what America made so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - whatever faith or background one may have, America welcomes everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of Kenyan, whose history as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with the election of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the white Americas this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back on the helm, say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your USA?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a loud" "no!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" "brooed the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your Americas?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "no!" "they answered."</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your Americas? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried, and their voices became louder. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, could have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the country, for which his son fell, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"that is now Trumps Land, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero commune in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguaean city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music played in both places, not only has changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby preColumbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for a few years now, the La banda de música (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments across the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from the school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty roads to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they are always laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the turtle you will learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, timpani, bongos and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village located at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with reprepared instruments made from local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made out of garbage."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls:"</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in garbage. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something he had never seen before: a violin made out of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments from reprocessed material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic Mülldeponie) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of trash every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like the people of Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of garbage to music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can fight illegal fishing successfully</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practiced solutions for environmental issues."</seg>
<seg id="99">Republication occurs as part of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a legislative breaker of this species on its shores.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to bypass one of their harbours and refused to give him a fisherman's approval."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior executive of the Kenyan fishing agency. he is part of a team who discovered and persecuted the ship."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was expelled from the waters of the region: it was not successful for him to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to plundering the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (illegal fishing stop)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries who then expelled the prime minister from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand up to each other when it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, where it is extremely difficult to detect. therefore, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were impeded by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions nowadays occur in real time, with traceability to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there the individual countries can exchange, for example, lists existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very carefully when they move on the open sea by means of satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas, such as those who indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly if they have a criminal record."</seg>
<seg id="116">"on the basis of this information, countries who are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such information in their harbours. what means that the ships cannot be sold for their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay sanctions, as in the case of prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of nfds Africa."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to regain estimated $20 million in lost revenue, which lost eight members of the HISH-i network every year due to the illegal fishermen invading in East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, where the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include activities such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specification of fanciful names, fish protected species and fish in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the missing international cooperation and make the weaknesses of an unbridled control system", "says Long." "previously a ship could fish illegally and a country could say" "You do not run my harbour." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">"so far, the closed front works."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspicious ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over long distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that should help FISH-i to detect suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track the illegal ships that are happy to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their positions, "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO that also deals with fishing data and offers technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems, for example, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland is therefore helping to build a system linking different levels of information. it should help FISH-i to find criminally acting ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO Skytruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana Marine Protection Organization: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed throughout the world by means of the position of each traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" join together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who does what to do - that simply makes sense, "he says." here is a chance for countries to unite and bundle their resources. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run in which a global system allows tracking of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities do not just detect criminals, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships that used to be fished without a license and hardly had to reckon with consequences, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have now reached a 33% rise in fishing turnover, since fishing boats are buying more licences."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board hauling nets, whose use is forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we have become a study object." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappear every year by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"there are six countries joined together in 2015, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. also, they are fighting illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's most recent member state Somalia could report his first big triumph: in October Greko 1, a ship running under false flag. and not only the ship was on the way without a license, and were used hauling nets that are now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was still penetrated into prohibited waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they fight against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special, collaborative way of working for the protection of the oceans is actually working throughout the world sea. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes on the subject of environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="201">"in the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were investigated, committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship."</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">"he started to bear the same name as his father, until the brutal military operations in La Perla prison which he watched at the age of 15, he suffered enough."</seg>

<seg id="205">"in the situation at that time, I thought that was fine."</seg>

<seg id="225">"I was 15 years old and in the situation, I thought that would be fine. for so, my father had educated me."</seg>
<seg id="226">"at the military base, I had to destroy documents that had belonged to the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="227">"these were all possible documents: University Degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, just everything."</seg>

<seg id="229">'There the prisoners are tortured '</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla with - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small pack wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a great clump of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">"on that day, I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects were stopped and kept me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">There the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">"I looked into it, and saw a couch that men were tortured."</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached the one end of a cable. the other end was fastened to the body of the person that was just tied up there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they rarely hold a man with handcuffs to the bed, overthrown him with water and hunted him a load of 220 volts into the genitals."</seg>
<seg id="242">Photo: Comisión Provincial de la Memoria</seg>
<seg id="243">The stank there was horrible... like a dirty diaper.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I recognized the smell immediately and it became clear that it is the smell of a body in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were tied with handcuffs and were wearing and binding."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke with" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian, who was also indicted in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were lying face down - all were tied at hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">"near the entrance, people kept silent on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners, he said," "What am you doing so, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"I said," "Why did you bring me down?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">"they were thrown into a pit, and were killed and buried by soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero killed a man there and killed.</seg>
<seg id="260">"according to the survivors, the Zivician Jorge Romero, who was also indicted in the La Perla-Ribera court, was sentenced to death by the students Raúl Mateo Molina."</seg>
<seg id="261">"in the following video, Emilio Fessia, head of the La Perla Memorial, leads through the former torture chambers."</seg>
<seg id="262">The way you came in here is also the way where the kidnapping came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">"if you look on the map, you see that they took about this path and were tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanization.</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the arrangement from above came that they should be relocated."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphemism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'war ute'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all kinds of stolen things home.</seg>
<seg id="269">"at that time at the age I had no idea what the" "war" "- as they called it - was."</seg>
<seg id="270">"but when I was in the military, I was in Gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war prey is a bayonet, or perhaps military badge, which is taken against an enemy that is fought against."</seg>
<seg id="271">Luis Alberto Quijano with his son.</seg>

<seg id="273">"but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator, the record player, clothing, painting, money... steals, then it is not war, but vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">"I have always wondered how my father, the leader of the security forces, could join this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at the gendarmerie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do this.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal and I answered: and you, who gave cars on the street?"</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded against anger, struck me and cried:"</seg>
<seg id="282">"if you go so far, then I will find you and kill you."</seg>
<seg id="283">"to do so, we need nobody else!"</seg>
<seg id="284">So was my father.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have not a single good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">"when I said in the process, I showed a photo from that time on which I wore a jacket and a roll collar pullover. both had my father from La Perla."</seg>
<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he still brought clothes home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defence accused me of being a conspirator in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can put me on the burden of what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to testify.</seg>
<seg id="290">'The disappearance of the corpse is the last abominable act '</seg>
<seg id="291">"now, where I am older, I feel regrets."</seg>
<seg id="292">"I have children. once you have children, one can recognize the value of a life."</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and realises that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">"well, so you have executed people during the dictatorship, but why the corpses disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why children kidnapped?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day my father took a girl with her mother, whose mother was killed."</seg>
<seg id="298">"she was like our pet, almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl."</seg>
<seg id="299">"I always asked myself the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">It would have been easy to put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but why their bodies disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not even have families with whom to hand over their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the corpse is the last abominable act that one can do to a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">"my father told me when democracy was reintroduced, they fetched machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="305">"they were crushed and disposed of - no idea where." "you will never find anything," "said my father."</seg>
<seg id="306">But something remains of course always.</seg>
<seg id="307">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to clarify: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even at Gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my dad.</seg>
<seg id="311">"the thought to display my father arose during a conversation, when he was under house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="312">I had given him accusations because of all the atrocities I had to experience because of it.</seg>
<seg id="313">Then he suddenly said: "I don't know. I don't have killed anybody."</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt inwardly kicked and asked me why the whole exaggerated patriotism and the" "Western and Christian feelings" "which they allegedly defended were actually good."</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I screamed:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me something about it?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child.</seg>
<seg id="319">"he said," "Well, forgive me." ""</seg>
<seg id="320">That's exactly what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">In 2010 I refunded the first ad.</seg>
<seg id="322">I finally realized that he was a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="323">No one can reproach me that I am preoccupied. I have finally declared against my own father.</seg>

<seg id="346">Editing the original photos by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">"in the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving license, last month witnessed a very unfortunate translation."</seg>
<seg id="348">"on one shield the Japanese word (koreitasha), the" older motorist "means, wrongly - perhaps also with malicious background thanking & # 8212; translated as" fearful motorists. ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">"Joshua Levine's original photos, often shared in social media."</seg>
<seg id="351">"the error was similar to the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">"the Kyoto Shimbun, which appears in Kyoto, wrote:"</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "how could it come to such an English translation?"</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto, simply unacceptable," said Holmes. "</seg>
<seg id="356">"the faulty English translation was initially removed. the title" "terrible drivers" "was later replaced by the more appropriate, if also grammatically not quite correct term" "drivers" "(German:" older drivers ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the Kyoto prefecture was apologized to the translation errors. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation has not been checked for correctness before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows about the excuse:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we sincerely feel that elderly people felt insulted by inadequate corrections (the translation)," said the police. "</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News dealt with the phenomenon of the "friable" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" awful "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older motorists who are involved in accidents across the country is quite a concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto prefecture, for example, a total of 19.460 accidents were caused by senior citizens in 2005, representing a 10% share."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens created 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents."</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">"while the number of accidents is declining, the share of accidents caused by seniors increased in the same period."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language proficiency in order to transfer it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case in native speakers. generally speaking is the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the source language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, French native speakers should translate from English into French - not from the French into English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr-user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language, the translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who do not have foreign employees, can still make translations in-house. then, the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr-user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the confused and mysterious phrases that arise by machine translation, show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious prints which often decorate T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr-user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but by large companies or by the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards, you can expect more meticulous translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the Kyoto city will hopefully use a more serious source for their translations."</seg>

<seg id="391">"main page of the portal" "Navegcon con Libertad" "(Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Media and Society)."</seg>
<seg id="392">"on Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online broadcaster Vivoplay."</seg>
<seg id="393">"later, other users wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer available."</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters also carried recordings of the protests in Caracas organized by oppositional groups who oppose Nicolás Maduros government.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the protests started in early April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself."</seg>
<seg id="396">"Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a tracero. he pointed out that the connection was chapped and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet."</seg>

<seg id="398">It seems that Internet sites Venezuelan providers are again locked.</seg>

<seg id="405">"earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique through which the DNS server respond to specific domain requests."</seg>
<seg id="406">"if a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds incorrect or refuses the request when calling such a website."</seg>
<seg id="407">"we confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet"</seg>

<seg id="423">"the business is simple: a large family with little money passes her underage son or her underage daughter to another, more abundant family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"however, what is not mentioned is that the children must do so countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse will be - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted."</seg>
<seg id="425">"this practice, called Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated by the Crimean is generally silent."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," declares Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family who finds her daughter in the belief that she will complete her training, improve her position in society and" "make something out" "to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family who takes up the girl and justifies the exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise not receive education and perhaps even starved."</seg>

<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was in the household of the former military member Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira hit Marín as long as he suffered mortal injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">Some days later the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They emphasized that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of Criadazgo deeply rooted in the Criadazgo's death for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as a modern form of slavery.</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be no further Carolina "in Paraguay.</seg>

<seg id="452">"they want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was her criadita, sentenced to 30 years in prison."</seg>

<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the House of her employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day."</seg>
<seg id="461">"in doing so, she had to divide the time in such a way that you still have time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, clean the fridge, plastered the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was finished, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the more she finished studying, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">"Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but also didn't have limited food." I was allowed to pick up more books from the master's library as food from the fridge, "she recalls."</seg>
<seg id="468">"the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathisers of the partido Liberal, a liberal party, who belonged to the Opposition during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989."</seg>

<seg id="500">Image of Pixabay changed by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">"sixty Egyptian parliamentarians have recently agreed to draft a bill on" "regulating the use and use of social networks". ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"if he is accepted by Parliament, users of social media must register in Egypt at a governmental authority in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would then be set up which is tasked with providing citizens with permission to share social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of adoption of the law, users on the website would have to register their right names and identity numbers to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill consists of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" jedwede, "which is run over the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice, video and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft has no indication of how the Egyptian authorities should adopt the registration. unclear is also how the Egyptian authorities are not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyadh Abdul Sattar, Parliament representatives and promoters of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a username and password from the telecommunication department to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of it, it would be necessary for Egyptians to access information about their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on the spot are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" senior research technologist ") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian initiative for personal rights "), told Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt strongly about the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they pretend that just as they are forcible physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, that means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who seek approval or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a trial."</seg>
<seg id="517">"this is technically not at all realistic, but in Egypt everything is possible."</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislative elections and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft is in accordance with a pro-military mindset in the Parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensured that no deviating narration is present on the screen," "says Raoof."</seg>
<seg id="520">"last year, the parliamentarians of Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a legal action against cyber crime in which a life-long prison sentence was intended to threaten the" public order "and to incite protests."</seg>

<seg id="526">"a subspecies of the larger family of leopards, which wipes through Africa and Asia, belongs to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered due to wild animals, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they find less and less booty."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," "The Persian leopard is the only remaining beast of the Kurdish ecosystem" "and the health and remembrance of the ecosystem depends on the fact that there is a big predator."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. when the team in the video shows that they have a large cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for the northeast of Japan, documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those killed by the" triple catastrophe "of March 2011. a violent earthquake, a tsunami and an accident in Fukushima triggered the disaster."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was a prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring architectures of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, because the tsunami had lost entire coastal cities from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition to this, Fukushima prefecture has been living a nuclear accident, for this reason alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">"from a local point of view, the Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents."</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>

<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was able to list the biggest success among the three prefectures, here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were finished."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such homes, whereas Fukushima is a 70 percent closing light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"still, six years after the catastrophe, the evacuated von Behelfssault (of the" "Bulkkasetsu juutaku" ") could be relocated to final replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the three-fold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in homes."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes."</seg>
<seg id="557">"nearly 40 per cent of those evacuated from Fukushima still live in emergency homes, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuation, which breathed after the disaster in homes, were resettled to final homes."</seg>

<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures affected</seg>
<seg id="560">"like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by misfortune, opened their doors to December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 per cent of fishing harbours are in operation in Iwate and Miyagi, only 30 per cent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">Tsunami and the nuclear accident have grown largely in the three Prefectures of Agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent of devastated arable land in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fukushima are located in the" nuclear plywood area. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered largely again, but Fukushima remains far away."</seg>

<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to experience not only the huge earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima Prefecture also witnessed the worst, disaster-induced, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 there were over 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, converted into permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"according to the 2017 state, 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still live outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"most of the evacuation areas are more than 50 years old in the disaster areas. it is known that the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive building projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games, which will take place in Tokyo in 2020."</seg>

<seg id="626">"with the introduction of Álvaro Reynoso's law, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in whole Cuba closed the doors (photo: Julio Batista)"</seg>
<seg id="627">"the popular Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site."</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were paralyzed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after the acquisition, the sugar cane industry in the region stood still, and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories that are still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">"Nene, a soldier veteran who rises every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep."</seg>
<seg id="634">"he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long inactive period because they were preserved."</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">"Nene recalls to have heard that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept."</seg>

<seg id="641">The old railway steig of the community saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">"the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and they were hardly competitive for the country."</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the small productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">But the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">"from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar will remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 published report of the OECD and FAO, the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations."</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities in Canada are concerned with topics that are important to them. they do so with hip hop thanks to a series of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshops supervises mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the educator David Hodges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree hip hop group The Northstar.</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop emphasizes that the young participants engage in talks such as" cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance, "or whatever comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the US state Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsum Calum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of Tears, "a road section in West Canada, where almost two dozen young women were disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely not elucidated.</seg>
<seg id="700">"the next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite the influence of globalisation."</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus will be sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the young people involved here received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstar hip hop group, who gave them a strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree."</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcription, as well a translation into English, which is translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise to one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how to live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">"this way, they can grow and continue our youth as well."</seg>
<seg id="712">"so, they can do what the Creator intended to do."</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, are exhibited near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (the" "Plastics models of the dishes" ") issued by any food served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to producing these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a number of these small companies producing those plastic dishes, which the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most of the Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they are not even more noticeable to them. however, a new trend now turns into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">Naver Matome published the Blogger itinii series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new plastic ribbons decorated with plastic ribbons as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods were transformed into kitschy collecting objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of Essentials is becoming increasingly more time-consuming.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a caise-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was turned into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">Also this part was made for the exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing plough into the Comintern.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile stand and mobile designers allow you to make your own work of art. in this case, icura or salmon-deceived are used, a popular topping that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"there is someone who would say:" Wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughter rocheers?. ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic courts can also take a less appetizing form, for example, to surprise colleagues or family members."</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the shape of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also padstables (onigiri), earrings and handbags made of dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">"other skurrile plastic dishes can be found at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow Twitter on the hashtag # of the" "hashtag #" "of the" "Bully". ""</seg>
<seg id="743">"if you would like to learn more about the origins of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the Cappabashi area, which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry. like with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the Missing and Beasts plunge into statistics on a regular basis. however, these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings."</seg>
<seg id="750">"reports on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, urged the stories of victims of the conflict completely into the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the mourners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind each corpse, behind every bone finding in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never heal."</seg>
<seg id="753">"therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" with drug trafficking ")."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, if shops close because they are threatened by drug traffickers and that whole municipalities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain of Sacrifice</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (english: "like fear life") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches for every weekend secret tombs after his son."</seg>
<seg id="761">"or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task we have placed before, and to look for graves, according to the people we loved. "</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electric business in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On October 13th he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th he was supposed to be back again, but he never came again." Emma Veleta: "it's very difficult for me because I am alone with three children who need a training."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me too."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you have the assurance of my father, but she does not pay them out because they require a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where shall we get them? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must show not only the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known illness and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"every day I come to newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or out of specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the socket.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year old cousin thinks he wants Narco (German: drug dealers) when he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the" heroic deeds "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me this is, as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that they also have something happening."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the sleeplessness of men is incredible to me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village justified it that they were" resident. ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they are trying to persuade them that they remain spared by such tragedies, if they are not stirring and quiet."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" Four months blackmail in the Hauptstadtdistrikt: how a family with threats was looted out. "in this, it describes how armed criminals month paid money from their business until they had not only destroyed the business but also torn their family apart."</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and remember how many people can completely change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain of it never fails, the trauma remains, the fear comes back again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the more we are away from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they are kidnapped or killed."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I asked myself in these terrible days whether weeping would resolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">"the journalist, Mario Gutiérrez Vega, published the article" The Uncharted Children of Ciudad Juárez: a Generation of Violence. ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is an orphan and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, potatoes, tortillas warm and" Chichi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - indescribable for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood had been past two years earlier, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, who was shot by armed men out of a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">"Bryan was born in 2006, as violence by organised crime and fighting against the already existing social problems in Juárez."</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of killings according to the Government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the public prosecutor had 3103 killings. this equates to 8.5 killings per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundred thousand stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we must not forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "animal político has launched the Narcodata journalism project, whose aim is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking that has tortured the country in the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="819">"but how is the years after something has appeared the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist."</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first release, it has been misled to portray tragedies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this false coupling of picture and event -" "false description" "or" false context "in terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010 a tank truck crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped around and exploded."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and devastated it. the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to drive."</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically the tank truck fell victim to the victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">"officials of the authorities described a fireball, the dozens of houses, including a cinema close by, which was full of people who watched the football World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and carbonated corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">"an image entitled" This is Nigeria. "from Imgur users Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows series of carbonated bodies that are strung on the ground while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo was taken up several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastic of atrocities before which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and corpses were placed in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the numbers could not be confirmed." nobody left behind to count corpses, "said one inhabitant of Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many were chased, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">"only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time was shown in a figurative way."</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to gain land (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo as it was wrongly presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris. "</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of depreciation and Africa check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as evidence of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">"one step further, personal comments like this example falsely falsify the image from the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to provide arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a lightning news, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee were punches, rape and several dead, some through burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported on the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this picture was taken by an Saudi Arabian news site, wrongly claimed in 2012, the President Myanmars Thein Sein have said, monks and politicians were involved in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the picture from DR Congo to make this information."</seg>

<seg id="921">"after a message that allegedly was written by a" "Pater Juan Carlos Martos" "on the Nigerian massacre, there were discussion forums such as this here in Vietnamese and declared it to be false."</seg>
<seg id="922">"from the message in which the image was contained in the DR Congo, the organisation of the Claretine Missionaries and Fr. Juan Carlos Martos was dissociated."</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assassinations of Christians through Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the assassinations of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Understanding religion and the value of human life is both important. it is therefore worthwhile to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">"a deeper question, however, is what happens when readers no longer believe these pictures."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are tens of people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"suggestion this mood of mis- and false information, that actual atrocities are untrue and does it diminish the real horror of what happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even asked by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that violent images of readers and viewers desensitise and have the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media work on helping others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is some debate about violent demonstrations in the news media, the fact that they are indispensable for today's news coverage."</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about situations in which an image suggests something which actually can also be detached from context or completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">"however, any investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be."</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (for example insidible) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to be translated at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words can be found in any language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these conflicable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese acid) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example Spanish sobmesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">"a word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word."</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for a while.</seg>
<seg id="950">"most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of" Untranslatable "Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages."</seg>
<seg id="951">"for example, in the blog you can find words from Vanuatu's Vanuatu tax, such as:"</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - wearize for your parents in recognition of how to make your efforts in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">Words in the Hunset language spoken in parts of Brazil such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The convenience or laziness you feel after having warmed up in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">"they entangle other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity."</seg>
<seg id="957">"sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page want to publish more of these" "conflicable" "words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are."</seg>
<seg id="958">"speakers of" "Treasure Languages" "which are appreciated by Untranslatable are invited to upload their favourite words here."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"with the goal of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which took place on 72 million US dollars, on April 3, 2017 several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration; the march started at the Puertorician Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went until the Plaza de Colón in the old city of San Juan."</seg>
<seg id="1156">"it was proclaimed by the group" "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" "(civil front for the re-examination of debts) and the ecumenical Assembly of Puerto Rico."</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the reconstitution of debts have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their requirement:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Rico require that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debts must be held responsible for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial review and a Steering Committee without personal interests in public debt, with a firm, our working conditions appropriate remuneration paid in favour of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people Puerto Rico refuses to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be detained with declining retirees.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate measures.</seg>

<seg id="1167">"hence the so-called" Centre for New Economy, "a non-profit organization without party affiliation with a focus on socio-economic development, a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state supervision."</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico necessitates a wide restructuring of state infrastructure.</seg>

<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">"more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue to campaign for his freedom and remind the contributions he made for an open network."</seg>
<seg id="1185">"at this year's re-conference: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is hosted in Berlin, dedicated an event to the # FreeBel campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1186">"Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, a managing director at Book Sprints, a publishing house published by so-called 'Book Sprints', a publisher of books published by so-called 'Book Sprints' within three to five days, a publishing house of the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: a collective research)."</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year contains a series of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of repression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built, and what the real cost is, with which this is connected."</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have side by side to look beyond the fog, which surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our different experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who have been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current state or residence."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release, and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"to see how Bassel pays a high price for its participation in a free culture, many of us have started to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of times of extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown location from the Adra prison, a non-military institution."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" Military Police Bassel had taken part in Adra "as a" strictly secret "command of the Military Court."</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that it was contacted by people on November 12, 2015, who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">But its location and state remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels had cultural prototypes foresighted than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archeological sites in the world, was the cross-cross of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, bassel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this strife into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not yet close this project."</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my entire life living with freedom, and bassel taught me to embrace it."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel gave me English even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a prosthesis, which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband, when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Book cover from Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It is happening":</seg>
<seg id="1228">"it happens during each visit,"</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes</seg>
<seg id="1230">"that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace,"</seg>
<seg id="1231">"that I don't care about any of the dangers,"</seg>
<seg id="1232">"each of the fences, shackles and guards"</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the jails of the prison</seg>

<seg id="1239">"to bring back all the moments,"</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to weep and smile about your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I testify to myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">Ghazi wrote on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bassel:</seg>
<seg id="1243">"one year passes, my soul"</seg>

<seg id="1245">"I am in your cage,"</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you are still in the cage of monsters</seg>

<seg id="1248">"since the beginning of the protests against the Bashar al-Assad regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights)."</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">"by 2016, at least 17.723 Syrians have died in custody since 2011 according to the international human rights organization Amnesty International."</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: head of corruption condemned by corruption back to previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">"Mozambique reacted with anger to a corruption case, where a government member after half of his prison sentence returned to the working place in the state apparatus in which the corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza who was arrested in 2008 and in 2010, together with four other defendants, was sentenced to 22 years in jail together with four other defendants."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds from the Mosambik airports, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re-attitude to the company, which happened on April 19."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, who evaluated the application, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza, to return to his old post, since the company has not fulfilled any disciplinary procedure after his detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants are not enjoying the action."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution responsible for public transparency, condemned the company's decision to address the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle."</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that the company should also introduce a disciplinary approach against the wrongdoing.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company seems, however, and caused no appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, an important voice in the mosaic social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "disgusting" ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza would be a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence, and half of them had dinner."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he has consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence."</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"bitone Viage, young Mosambian and student of political science in Brazil says that the director has no moral:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the state, because he insulted him, I can't believe that you are rewarded in such a way that has already insulted the state."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks morals to return and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served himself by the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remind a thief in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">"thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel, not only as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, cutting-edge and - incidentally - prophetic speaker."</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook is blocking the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users wrongly</seg>
<seg id="1287">"the Burmese word" "Kalar pae" "means chickpeas or splitting."</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although still discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or" "in Burmese script" "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radically nationalistic movements gave the word an extremely dissipative connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful contents on his platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"'Kalar' may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically call for hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for its use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">"moreover, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings, which have the same character sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written to Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splitting legs), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebook user Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by doing a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase ku la -" "cure" "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to Facebook's initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that they will reduce hate speech by radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before it extinguishes all posts that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook clears the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write to Factook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the words by side."</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (splitting legs).</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these dirty nationalists, spread hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to everyone, propagating hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not be long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have shown that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative spelling of censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts, when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banished by the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new rule of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to use the Liken, post and share content for 24 hours because the post" didn't meet the Facebook community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech radically nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words such as" stools "or" peas curry. ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits, which would give them a big turnover, it would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has caused a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users are now amusing Facebook and deliberately write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which didn't include hate speech, but still removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out if Facebook removes the post that contains the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot is used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"if you are a doctor, do you heal people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot is used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally heat the violence in the congregations in Myanmar, especially in the area Rakhine, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his failure to bring out the proliferation of hate speech on his Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but rather than simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to focus more on context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the country's statistical central office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 in 1997-2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movements that endeavoured to abolish laws for childrens, followed at the foot and rejoiced with great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this result."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, not everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no concerns to say to the critics of the childrens, they should, to be damn about their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition ensured tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the bill."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the childrens - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must approve and proclaim the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">"one of the senators of the country posted a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle has posted on Instagram again:"</seg>

<seg id="1391">"the Wikipedia article was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally darkened."</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than one month Turkey has now blocked the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series fight against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many techniques-based internet users are used to use conversion tools for blocked web pages (a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third biggest VPN prevalence), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking articles by Wikipedia since 2008, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the internet law (No. 5651) has been adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"according to China, Turkey is the two most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated)."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralised peer-to-peer network (i.e. hosts computer connections), which does not support the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">"despite legal restrictions, the content is available."</seg>
<seg id="1402">IPFS reports on his efforts in a blopost:</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after we heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put everything in store snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the ability to read the content on decentralized and distributed ways."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia contents, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklope.org. a mirrorsite from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors if in the respective country Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"it is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror."</seg>
<seg id="1410">You can access another URL that is not the original. that which you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">"in essence, the server redirects the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves if they are locked in Turkey."</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">"Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him, never satisfied."</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry on a camera and try to gravitate the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar is trying to bring Nepalese animals to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this prime situation helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be a leopard on the banks of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">"my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately began to kneel pictures!!"</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nepal's nature and wants to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know it, for he rose tigers from face to face:"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of Buhek appeared. he sits immediately, we see ourselves and he stares me through the Sal trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo" I click for conservation "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"however, his passion for promoting Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"he waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Otter at Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could take a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organisation from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women avoid the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they should respect the husband because of the social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences, they should respect the norm to keep this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state Odisha and violated by her family and the village community after she had appealed to a married relationship with her name."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of their wives also does not call on behalf, is also widespread among men. however, they have far less access to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health professionals and housewives, became a unique club and thus became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Video Volunteers community and advocates the exploitation of patriarchal."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas has been working with the help of her video camera for seven years at the discovery of practices, such as children's council to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and leads these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video that Rohini showed in her discussion, acted by women who did not call their husbands on behalf."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"to pronounce the name of their husbands, it is a custom that they owe all obligations and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not consider this, is considered to be deceptive, as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply entrenched that we never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband so far, wanted to try out at home as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband still remained silent after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him now by his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini launched her first discussion with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she said all," "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does that mean that they do not respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day on which they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," "says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of an age-old tradition, in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she was only choked during the whole exercise; another decided to release all the stolen frustrations against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in the adrenaline rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands on behalf."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next days, Rohini received a variety of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women into her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it for dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law solidified her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini said I should do it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less comprehensible and the situation generated in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred dot on the forehead, which shows the Ehestatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would wear the zinnobery point if he did it too."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I ceased to wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women did not complete with it, but think they are now in a better position to choose for themselves, not to carry it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip for each discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want the women to worry about who could hear something," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"in the last few months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have also talked about some things, for example, how our identities are linked to our husbands, never so honestly."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things loudly, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have borne only saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"most of them is okay, but some wanted to wear a salty curta, a wide shirt over a pant, they have not dared."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much controversy and discussion about the benefits of their own choice of clothes, morals connected with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own couple of Kurtas (Oberinhiden) in a discussion round so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is certain they will succeed."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"to the question whether in the five months since its first discussion club has changed somewhat, Rohini confirms that things are slowly coming into the roll:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">"so far, we have only done small steps."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then they stopped saying the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do it, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred at any time on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the feille for more freedom of movement or their own choice - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">As Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes home in the club and told other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers Community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" "news of those who experience it" "and offer a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development challenges."</seg>

<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">"the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissidents, Liu Xiaobo, has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized for liver cancer at the end of June."</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for" "Subversion" "after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that demands democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the State Department in China called Lius Fall as an" "internal affair" "and narrated a spokesman that he considered it" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">"nonetheless, China continues to authorize calls from the international community to release the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to permit him a treatment abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from foreign countries.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">"Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Liu."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"however, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu abroad to be treated."</seg>
<seg id="1639">South Africa</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer questions about Lius Release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway came into force after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations continued until December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon farms to China, as the exports have largely been blocked since 2010."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">United States of America</seg>
<seg id="1647">"on 6 July, the European Parliament passed a decision in which China was called to free Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants."</seg>
<seg id="1648">"the top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for China to release Lius, as stated in an explanation on June 30:"</seg>
<seg id="1649">"at the same time, we expect China to raise all the restrictions of Mr. Lius's wife and family members."</seg>
<seg id="1650">"they should meet and receive all visits they desire, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world."</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States</seg>
<seg id="1652">Terry Branstad told us that Americans "want him to have the opportunity for treatment abroad in so far as it assists him in his recovery.</seg>
<seg id="1653">"a spokesperson for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities to release not only Liu, but also to free his wife Liu Xia from their house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the invitation of the US embassy drew a furious answer from China to itself, with the utterance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that" no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible comments on Chinese internal affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told that China should offer the couple following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice, to which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the U.S. senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally."</seg>

<seg id="1661">The Chinese president Xi Jinping appeared on the G20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July.</seg>

<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">"on 28 June, the Canadian Ambassador John McCallum asked China to provide an appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"Liu's lawyer told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to speak and contact with someone outside, including his lawyers."</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"Canada is calling on China to protect its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release the exemptions for the exercise of these rights."</seg>
<seg id="1668">South Africa</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry called for China to release Liu for humanitarian grounds on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">"all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments he, regardless of where, needs. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there is no further information whether France will ultimately accept him."</seg>

<seg id="1676">"the spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed himself very much in an explanation on June 28 around Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for his well-being."</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">"it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished, would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"I felt personally very moved and encouraged also when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08 that stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was supposed to be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Association of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "turn logic" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we hear that ultimately we are not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you're not my country, whose land is it?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he was defending an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other" normal countries, "in the face of that, it seemed inevitably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently run by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre emerged from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the distorted logic, as it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end, the last week of Shanmugam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-responses."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He asked questions in a rational manner with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"when Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to what country belongs our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our werter K Shanmute would take the effort to clarify this point, if he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing his comment on the blog, he points out to critics that you should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that you can better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the inscription.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was rather a" city "than a country," he explained why the Singapore elections were so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities have seen a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said," "Be not a country," "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment on Shanmugam as a leader of a growing generation that makes such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what I expected - if I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he really believes and is aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review dismantle the weaknesses of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"Mr. Shanmugam" "believed a mistake" "or was it a joy of joy?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"when Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, on which country will the sovereign rights of the city go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is both land and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since it plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore pay their military service, but do they not defend their city, but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who has to pay back our Prime Minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the magazine Journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore is and has always been a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I haven't said what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have angered many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" "the defense of the country above all", "etc., but that is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1737">Canadian Ned Flanders.</seg>
<seg id="1738">Screenshot from a YouTube video.</seg>
<seg id="1739">Global Voices asked recently his editors: what is the most misunderstood aspect of your home country or homeland?</seg>
<seg id="1740">Their answers are published here as part of a continuous series with the rumours about certain parts of the world and another facet is to be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">"the latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question I am most asked in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, sorry, I answer." I come from Canada. "since 1994 I live and again in Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification usually follows the standard answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature. "many Canadians cook perhaps inwardly against anger if they are held for Americans, but don't annoy me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag visible on their backpack if they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">"so it was already when I began to travel through the world twenty years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11."</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always worn small maple leaves at their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1752">We have a free health care system!</seg>
<seg id="1753">There are no weapons with us!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Gender marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">"obviously, we often say" apologies. ""</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is said to be the tolerant country towards ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">"first, I have many American friends that I admire very much."</seg>
<seg id="1763">"it wouldn't matter to me, if one would switch to Johnny from Dallas for example."</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first: being called" nice "means to be fun - just like the benign, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" Die Simpsons "(who has their own Canadian double-worker)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" "nett" "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing that can be encountered."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means inconspicuous and uninteresting and not to earn attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from the things that happen around one."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a major property of the Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">"what outsiders call" "nice" "is perhaps simply cool politeness."</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence along with the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">"we lack the warm, open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends."</seg>
<seg id="1778">"luckily for us (and for the rest of the world), Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show that Canadians are more than just" nice. "our prime minister has made Canada downright sexy."</seg>

<seg id="1780">"a pop band famous in Thailand has published a music video that parounces the junta, which in 2014 took power and despite its promise, restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country."</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells what precepts his girlfriend makes.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"although not explicitly political, the music video is indirectly related to the continuing military rule of the Junta."</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video of the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">"in the first three days alone, the Video 1.254 was shared on Facebook and received 8,800 likes."</seg>
<seg id="1786">"last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video" Der dictator "in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video."</seg>
<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as it deals with the situation of the country under the junta rule."</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of the girls "may refer to the draconic section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives the commander of the army absolute decision-making on important national issues."</seg>
<seg id="1790">"the 11th rule:" change your attitude "refers to the notorious program for the" setting change "of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other individuals who are viewed by the Junta as a critic."</seg>
<seg id="1791">"the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activist and other critics of the state."</seg>
<seg id="1792">"for this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army, who oversees online content and accused persons accused of having perpetuated the monarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1793">"Thailand sets a strict program against" "Lese Majeste" "(majesty of the majesty)."</seg>
<seg id="1794">"on 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand."</seg>
<seg id="1795">"two days later, it came to a coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="1796">"one of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"in the video, it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an internication facility, another problem."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused" confusion "in society and Internet users are threatened by long penalties, they should offend the monarchy."</seg>
<seg id="1799">"meanwhile, the teaser of the song became members of the band that imitated the Salut from" The Tribute of Panem, "which was already used by putsch opponents during the protests in 2014."</seg>

<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez leads a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on the website of our partner PRI.org on 19 April 2017 and appears here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula. it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59- year-old Mexican actress, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bear."</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 dollars a night, guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - but there are hundreds of African and Haitian migrants.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Ms. Ramírez tells, people get into full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on cartons."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to hospital when they are sick, she buys them medications that they can't pay, they massage them with a balsam the fetus exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui who has a yoghurtbart) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Foto: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," "he answers with a smile." "I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very affectionate.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to take normal a first stop in South America and then move towards the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well known name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitians and the Africans are often travelling the circuit together and that Africans already speak on Whatsapp by Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weakened, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Ms. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," he answers smiling. "we will always be in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her guests to send her often text messages when they are gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">It declares that their Christian faith is the propulsion of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she does not know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the town a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter Valenzuela and his family have included migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to many African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he started to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a kitchen outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests undergo.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants, who travel through Tapachula, comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children from people who wanted to squeeze money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single person, has offered him its roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the corridors, the traveler quietly consults their telephones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic for those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she blends her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair braids, who made her a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sad while she presents her briefly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeats them every time. "they have gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users of the" "Deutsch" ""</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of the city Urumqi received a phone notification in which they address the district government, a monitoring app called Jingwang (or" Web Cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the communication, it is said that the app" "prevent access to terrorist information". ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities tended to use the app for more than fighting terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested at the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they, shortly after they had installed the app, had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police said that the app would identify and persecute the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main feature is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend it online and remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while reporting about digital censorship in China mostly focuses on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often düsterer for those who live in remote, repressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, authorities often arrange extreme zensors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet abstentions."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the media outlet, based on Twitter," Images from my China "(the" "Energieplan" "), published censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint, at which policeman checked the residents indiscriminately if they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjiang make sure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that the people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are discovered in a Checkpoint with a device without this software, you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the control technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from" "China" "(" "Deutsch" ") also published a Jingwang product description, out of which the software can raise the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones will become electronic handcuffs in Xinjiang."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the directions of the City Party Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and the party related facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office when operating their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of Urumqi, a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs, until August 1, their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards "at the local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist videos. "however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible offences, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="1994">"this is the first of six reports in the series" "sleep or death" "in which the activist Sarmad Al Jilane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison."</seg>
<seg id="1995">"far from our blue, virtual world, you look at you and find that you are alone in a place where everything is gone."</seg>
<seg id="1996">Everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth which clearly recognises both internally and externally.</seg>
<seg id="1997">One that makes all honour to their name.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One that has defeated in a list of feelings and expressions that don't allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"but when the reality recovers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting, the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood, and all screams for death."</seg>
<seg id="2000">"all doubt arises in smoke and you become aware of your existence, even though the Earth is turning on the axis of evil. it becomes clear that you are caught here between the walls that your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone for stone."</seg>
<seg id="2001">"they arrested me and my father three times, but that was not enough for me to learn" my lesson, "as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="2002">He showed his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five teenagers were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest.</seg>
<seg id="2004">"it was sufficient for the city to shatter the darkness of the night with" "Allahu Akbar". ""</seg>
<seg id="2005">"all the neighborhoods were coveted, but my own not."</seg>
<seg id="2006">"for the first time, it was quiet, no rain, at the wrong time, even though I did not put high demands on a city that is up to the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">In the third night things had calmed down after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning.</seg>
<seg id="2008">"I broke through the silence, by screaming several times" "Allahu Akbar" "from my house roof."</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice resisted by the silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later some of my friends felt courageous enough to find together.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"many friends, true friends joined me; we joined us to a magnificent image that filled my expectations fully and completely."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"in such a moment you realize that you release the spirit out of the lamp, but it is simply not interested in the least."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"I received a call from my father:" "do you ready, we meet with the military security building."</seg>
<seg id="2015">He put up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">"then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow down - nothing can give you your voice, after giving you all the way to the office of the security service out of the body."</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">"the Colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was there, as I was now."</seg>
<seg id="2019">"the Colonel Ghassan starts to speak," "Let me hear how you cry out" "Allahu Akbar" "or you are only brave enough to scream if we are not near."</seg>
<seg id="2020">His hateful eyes focused on me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"and you really trust what to look into my eyes, and not on the ground!"</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was at my folly, vanity, perhaps in the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure of my thing when I replied: "I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"and I think I never stopped looking to see you in my eyes, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I do not regret that which I said."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"put him in solitary confinement, and his father with it."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"his father equals with it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2030">The stench of this accursed sentence is up to this day in the nose.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"he became a" "syndrome", "a spiritual torture I was exposed for months."</seg>
<seg id="2032">I crossed the yard.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In the first office I leave everything I wear with myself.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Then back through the yard and into the second office that leads through a gang to the individual cells.</seg>
<seg id="2035">I conceive all details exactly before I enter the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Otherwise they probably have allocated a larger cell to me this time.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"I have to share them with only one more prisoner, and I must immediately place myself without waiting for their permission."</seg>
<seg id="2038">"after a few minutes, which felt like a whole life, the official left the cell and I went back to an old-tried communication method: to beat the fist against the wall."</seg>
<seg id="2039">"I learned that my Zellenic fin was a" "self-help". ""</seg>
<seg id="2040">After a long hesitation he answered me finally.</seg>
<seg id="2041">"apparently none of the surrounding cells was a respectable middle aged man who looks similar to me and called" "Doctor". ""</seg>
<seg id="2042">"in perfect darkness, no distinctive facial features can be recognized, and doctors are not there; we are all only numbers."</seg>
<seg id="2043">Maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine?</seg>
<seg id="2044">All the answers are linked to their existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was moved to one of the large cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Maybe he will hear immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">"the investigator had assured me, they would leave him free if I stay."</seg>
<seg id="2048">Liars.</seg>
<seg id="2049">I would have had a scarecrow to expel all these crows that are in the garden of my head.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"from afar, I still hear them" "Allahu Akbar". ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">"it must be about 10 o'clock in the evening; always at this time, the cries, every day."</seg>
<seg id="2052">The door opens.</seg>
<seg id="2053">"I was always convinced that black is the colour of perdition until I saw the yellow light that surrendered to us the horror in person: the Raad (say," Donner, "Anchorage on 13th Sure of the Koran)."</seg>
<seg id="2054">They are here to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"thus, the secret was: to protect the state security against us and prevent us from releasing the traitor and terrorists in us, they speak in the alawitic dialect - so they played their confessional press card and betrayed the narrow field of view of their world view."</seg>
<seg id="2056">Here is not a house that is not a country; it is a curse that they call coexistence to transform the criminals of their sound into a hero.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"I supervised the hearing room and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he seems to me."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"he catches a" pleasant "conversation, despite the facial expressions that escapes him:" my boy, you are still young, you can start as much more important with your life as you join those days and protest on demonstrations that will soon find an end. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I used it to me to not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can really no longer say when insults and beats have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly chat.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how it happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"any voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished, even though I did nothing to earn this penalty."</seg>
<seg id="2064">On punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the cloaking.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner rejoices in your screams.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot keep your cry."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my screams didn't suit him yet enough, which is why they exchanged the tube through a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"at my first arrest, I asked if the investigator had worked as a garbage collector before or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had intertwined four cables to present us, from their point of view, great invention of a huge cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within a single hour three of them alternated while I was still on the line.</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped crying."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner noticed the cooling down, and didn't find favor on it, which is why he was next to an electrically charged rod."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"power flows through my entire body, enough to supply my whole district."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"my half-naked body lying on the ground, was the perfect conductor."</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was there again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"some hours passed, which seemed to me like minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning light fills the room." Raus with you, Assfuck. "</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man:" my Lord, my father must be fearful. "</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and get you, you will be misplaced."</seg>
<seg id="2087">This was new.</seg>

<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think so, because I am a man," "while he dissolved in water, Nescafe shook into two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the blows of lukewarm coffee and the checkers of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially if you have a look at the neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan waters - to avoid landing in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Ministry of Interior of Jordan said a performance of the band Mashrou 'Leila, for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer, Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former spokespersons of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahub said in an interview with CNN that the concert "just" was cancelled because of sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which demand the old-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila rated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to advocate an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement probably should not be simply shallow rhetoric, but actually reflect an increasingly clear crystallizing reality in Jordan that clearly appears in Hdaib's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib recovered from traditional sex organs by losing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently bleached woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in recent years, Jordan has increased the number of" Honorary Citizens "- the inofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of Honour killings reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still shocking that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure in order to support women, victims, murder or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of intra-family violence may be held at an indefinite time in prison, and for their release there is often a long-term bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee provided by the family that the woman is not going to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaib's music also enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but assumes that he puts his music, which is full of explicit assurances on sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot separate from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics was intimidated by me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib tackles the question of the Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and" ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of the songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse often repeats itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words" what you want "- be it faith or non-faith, heterogeneity or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anybody speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still heavily censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Yordan online program Roya in order to note that his comments were torn from context, twisted and censored in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was streamed but only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and advocates that intolerance against homosexuals does not speak to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuts, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to its homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nui, who later was to work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanier not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">There is nothing new in the hashemitic realm that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian intelligence service took several former government representatives and members of the teaching alliance, with the reason they had comments on commentaries in social media critically to the problems associated with the corruption rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the show Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanier."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has managed to conduct a show for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's how it looks like Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and inner changes. it is certain that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, from an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is approached by music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bombs, street unitions and artificial kind of democratizing democracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is ready, Hdaib will continue and therefore also resist."</seg>

<seg id="2150">"these big, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one assumes that there is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the strongholds, drums and dancing were marched over more than a thousand years, to force the indigenous population of the region, the Emishi, to its knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to grab a few great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a community center in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organised a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally)."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fortresses are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and yet another stunning way to spend his summer:"</seg>
<seg id="2159">"" "Yattemare" ""</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Outwardly outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from criminality and promote a legitimate profession like the hairdresser.</seg>

<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, appearance, and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to getting more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired a yearly event, the competition of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which takes place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts play against each other in order to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (other videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school of Augusto Salazar Bondy, who are located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their arms against hairdressing tools and to receive education in hairdressing tools instead of bad advice that allows them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and offering opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the message "Liebesmessenger to Guerillacrobbers," published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve. "</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who feel expelled to accommodate affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">This was exactly the question of the two young Colombian activists of Leonardo Párraga from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (Letters on Reconciliation) that encourage young people to write letters of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their country was setting a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the Guerillaboutweighing FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signatory of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">But there is still a long way in front of the Colombian people until one can speak of true reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"Guerrilla fighters, who lived in illegal camps for many years, were subjected to war rhetoric and, around the clock, had to integrate themselves into the lives of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian company, in turn, which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now engage in their ranks and support them in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that young Columbian people had to join together and to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and that's exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">The target of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - which is to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letter of reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, who took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we love the people we love, on Valentine's Day, write thousands of love letters, but those who need them much more necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plan, he continued to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent response."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support to former FARC fighters who now have to find their place in society and to build a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian company is ready to make the discourse of a war story into a common history of peace," "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation travelled to the camp to transfer the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC decided how they had done it earlier to accept the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's unbelievable how many different feelings one can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything in between, "the policy student Manuela Jiménez Avila told later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we handed over the letters, a former warrior took me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" "Cambuches" "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go, because beside him on the bed lay a MGL-Pomegrower, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I answered him anyway and said," "Hi, what do you do?" "he answered," "I answer a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life somebody has written something so beautiful, so I answer it." then suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks. "</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely and sat down next to the pomegrowers.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, I was sorry to be all the years of loyal companions of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never expected something different from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to protect him and his six brothers from starvation." "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside that waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the start, students and some leaders of the FARC organised a panel discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all raised up as already war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"that is why the leaders of the FARC announced the history of the organization, its ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process."</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to hear those people who have never experienced hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that people I have often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful emotions, which were turned around by their circumstances and their surroundings, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, hurts me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who killed and caused so much damage to teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the camp commandant of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example the Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that after disarmament peace would rule.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities exist, there will always be people who are willing to attack and protest for their rights, and this is also fully justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call upon all the defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has taken the international headlines several months ago, after reports were published containing the deportation, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who arrested suspicious men and arrested them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a wife, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since childhood, she felt that she was actually a woman."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was no safe place for her, why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chetschenen from the sexual equation of their landlady, the hunt was opened on Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">Her life moved to the USA out of fear for her life.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as an honorary helper in a human rights organization.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a acquaintance of Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone, of whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" then there's no more men in Chechnya that can remove this shame? "</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents made the round about the whole WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was doing a few shopping bags from the backseat of my car, I heard a male voice saying," Here is a gift for you from your uncle. ""</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" how long do you still want to dishonour the family, you Schandfleck? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that there was a young man, no 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had gotten everything along and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two sore sore in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases were you placed - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated because my male name is still on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they demanded to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that all was a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they asked absurd demands: some said to me, I had to prove it by running up without the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Grosny and say that I didn't change my sex that all was just bad-talk, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have seeds size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," You have brought a monster to the world that has not only corrupted your family, but the entire Republic. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put herself a knack around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later under the window stood a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened to the third time, it became clear to me that something was lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without registering myself, without notice, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I plucked the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't think about security, just because you left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about sexual equation, that's a taboo subject."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements I still wear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I desire, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best in order not to hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really try to look at how the person looks at which she recalls from her past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed behind?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: last week I submitted a report to Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for him, I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who has imprisoned one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told us that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock up a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"I mean, they probably invite the relatives who care about the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand a proof that the so-called" "honor" "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are still gay men held in these mysteries?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend tells me that there would be not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to settle Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they had attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, but deliberately immersed in order to radicalise themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that just a guess or have you a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person himself was there when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports about it yet. we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people, which belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, have already taken place in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, before 2003 I was already known throughout Grosny, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia wanted to introduce us to the" "Civilization", "but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, wore jeans Jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of Sharia has never curved me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew of it; they knew why men, young people met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language, there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that means:" "don't worry about the misfortune of another." ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children if they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they simply closed their eyes before you, because they believed you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never harmed me, never hunted and never smitten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace time last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began talking about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he spoke not about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, one could sense how people started to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"he who had guarded and laughed before, looked at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deteriorated."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teetreff, gatherings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get out of essences."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I clipped cubs.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so is nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chetschenen, who want to show you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no gay amongst them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have those who have cabardines which, the Russians also have; on the whole planet, they are - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it's unpleasant to listen to that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims walking in the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think at Transition to men who love men and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different ways of feeling, in order to be accurate, different attitude settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and do not harm me for my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry that I will be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not very sad at all - I just know that I am myself now.</seg>

<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness to be able to pay the incapacity for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who work and remain anonymous in Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube took the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames and Moramazi was brought to the Talegiani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could no longer do anything."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahmadazi minority, and activists warn against the fact that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - was hanging."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers, who felt helpless and incapable of feeding their families and going on a safe work because of the persecution by the Iranian government."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahraazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region in which a majority of the Arab Ahwazi community live in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to deny its livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and undertook great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets little of this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and privations."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime denies the Ahmadazi-Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil, gas, and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a variety of dams that surround the waters from the Arab areas to the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are located."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused by dryness, and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawzi young people rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director for co-operation, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, 55% completed secondary school and 45% have a university degree."</seg>

<seg id="2423">"because of this, a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the adjustment process is a combination of a high number of ethnic and anti-Arab discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since functionaries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahmadazi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihoods outside their homes of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahmadazi, as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances given by the Arab Ahwazi, human rights activists kill alarm before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>

<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. added by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on Afroféminas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can be read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be female feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women still earn less money despite equal education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on sex is still moving across the many different countries and faiths."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"yet: when I come to speak on skin color, on racism, on black women women, on black women in the LGBT community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention whatever kind we have been abused physically, emotionally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to silence in white intersectional feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "lift up their voices and" "Kumbaya, my Lord", "to achieve equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about that in addition to sexualized violence, there is an institutionalized form of racist motivated violence that we are faced with black women in two ways."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and countries of origin deserve less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk, suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join myself as a black woman who refuses to consider injustices in their thinking that relate to both the gender and skin colour of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere who has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Sojourner complained in 1851 in her speech:" "am I no woman?" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical point a terrible and marginalized being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation to advance their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping of skin colour and gender, because some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to reward them for a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded to give women from different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, still the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself fully and completely from feminism and to join me to the movement of Womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before we define black women according to our own ideas and move into spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming ourselves (such as: Africa-Womanianism: how we recapture ourselves), that we can defend ourselves in this way, in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which constitute the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can blossom in an environment where my life is neither passed, nor ignored."</seg>

<seg id="2471">"I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child," "says Musa."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence against Women in Paraguay" by Kurtural.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner said Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her spouse, who had become violent against her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship, some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be placed on the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman showed Balbuena for abuse, the knowledgeable ad of Ada Báez was not useful."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second wife drew back her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women are instructed at all, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women, who admit to be victims of violence, complain at all with the prosecution authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"inhalts1 Strikes and Statistics2 Invisible abuses and a legal system, which has nothing inferior to Paraguay's laws: good approach, flawed implementation beats and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to find out how many women are really maltreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay." "there are various indications and reports that show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," "she explains."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the available figures are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the District Prosecution filed 9600 ads for domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads at the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the courts of peace. here too 86% of women's ads came.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women said that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women's ministress Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated." on every woman who refuses in Paraguay for mental ill-treatment, 9 women who do not do this. "</seg>
<seg id="2498">"any woman who refuses for physical abuse will come to two women who do not do this," she declared at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a criminal offense, the prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"only until August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of genocide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible maltreatment and a legal system that does not undermine</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"at the beginning, she didn't want to do it, but then she did. this should be regrettable for ever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time most recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never have thought that I would once become victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happens to women who are too submissive because they let themselves be deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why she had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they would say that victims of abuse should at least have a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who was not from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was ill-treated her."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her prosperous partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victorias ads with the authorities remained without a result, and also from their relatives, she did not receive support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"it led a process against her former partner who developed into an unmanageable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country, where it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays laws: good approach to flawed implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," says Victoria Santos. "</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was debated in the Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# fürst)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non EineWeniger) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law stipulates that Femizid is to be declared a stand-alone criminal and punish as it is the case already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"in some respects, the legislative text has been changed in order to win the decriminalisation of abortions that are generally banned in Paraguay and are being punished with up to five years in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill foresaw, the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) process costs, which must be borne by the victims of violence at the present time, if they just want to furnish an ad and would like to receive a safe place to raise the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">"in Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"here, a rethinking must take place so that violence is no longer seen as normal."</seg>
<seg id="2537">"who is silent in the face of these facts, complicates and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators will escape."</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to make a long ad until ill-treatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"on 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been altered."</seg>
<seg id="2540">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"the filing of the words" gender, "" political violence "and" sexual harassment "of parts of the law, however, is considered a great setback."</seg>

<seg id="2587">"Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, figure takes place with his consent"</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: firstly, many medicines and vaccines are missing in the offer of the global healthcare system that cover the special medical need on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have much more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"second, research conducted by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Center for the Research of Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, just as the AIDS epidemic revealed first serious effects on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he studied himself at the HIV virus before he decided to go back home in order to support the Libyan health system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research."</seg>

<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">"Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the focus of my work lies on the application of research results. in doing so, I support the sambian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I just set a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">What are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this has to change, otherwise we will always remain beneficiaries instead of being makers."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not well used in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>

<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not conform to standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>
<seg id="2615">"laboratory equipment is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">"RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods."</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GM: how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support the development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>

<seg id="2622">"there is need for special academic training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research of space, healthcare (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from this."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here."</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine published about solutions for environmental problems around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding lettuce in the US since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outdoors, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by its own resourcefulness and the question of how many kinds of lettuce can be obtained."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents do not only apply to individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or crimped leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been registered for more and more plants such as grain or card types. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia tradition, Morton still breeds a salad, but it needs no longer, since his work is increasingly complicated by increasing restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if in a river a rock broocks are lying around which I must paddling.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the tradition of breeding," he says. "I think that these patents go far too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, no one can breed a new type of salad because all the features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very cautious and strives to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement growing in the United States and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red reddish salad in the "greenhouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative ("Open Source" seed initiative) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called OSSI, US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seeds that they were bred."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it." open Source "breeders simply allow others who buy their seeds to breed them, and not immediately select - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Scaffold prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"Professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI board member Jack Kloppenburg include control over seed and the possibility of breeding new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"as a result, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the "open-source" movement does not concern genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants may be patented, whether vegetable, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." "to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seed, as it is for example on farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without food sovereignty is not possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to continuing to provide others with their seeds, in contrast to patenting seed and plant features."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus increasingly available, is uninterrupted."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of the OSSI, has occupied herself with genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"such estimates do not exist for other plants, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-grown plants such as wheat are patented in an even larger style than lettuce or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are bred so that they are specifically desirable characteristics - from such, through which their taste or colour is improved up to such, because of which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders diminishes through more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before, since the changed conditions are much worse by climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property uses other breeders because" patents and the protection of plant variations are promoting innovation. "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired."</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"thus, such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by providing more material and expertise to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks different: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, certainly no innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"if one had to wait for such a long time to breed on plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the struggle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders do not have the time or money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us forward, and it will be impossible for us if we do not continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"overall Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant characteristics:" "we do not really create the features themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" who breeds one type, also breeds its own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures are required to cultivate mass-wise herbicides to grow in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is just gentler." ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such, who are moving on international markets but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto) patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the pattern or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant owner Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeder would innovate by avoiding plant patents:" "it looks like I'm with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patented."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I constantly need new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years", "he says." "with a patent you are protected against competition for 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be a leader in the" "Open Source" "breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly across the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is a" open source "seed program."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also helps them to reach "open source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation Agrecol is working on an open source license which is ultimately a more formal and legally binding form of the OSSI commitment to breeder in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, why the OSSI obligation cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"in early November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; it is now on the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos held a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from all East Africa come together to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend to patenting seed."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for" open source "seed systems declares that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for" open source "seed systems, for which scheduled for the next year will be the official starting signal."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a merger of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the International Nonprofit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food - has published a report from aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also highlights the importance of a diverse, local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a connection from the Luby of OSSI hopes that more people will soon be recognized."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has largely paid attention to where and how something is grown, and seed systems have barely played a role, so Luby." we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food. "</seg>

<seg id="2740">"but now, having blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities opened 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. these were technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etiletat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"AFTE also documented the blocking of providers, by transferring internships and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, 12 June, we noticed how the blocking of web pages, the VPNs, began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering the contents of the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is also exacerbated by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which they can proceed against these acts against these acts."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and whom will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">"Brazilian troops deployed in the Favelas in Niterói, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis."</seg>
<seg id="2752">"photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0"</seg>
<seg id="2753">"day after day newspapers throughout Brazil report dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcards."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro has assassinated" "thieves robbing pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and Air afee to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio achieved the highest level for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice called even the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"the" Extra "newspaper published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on August 16, published the editorial" This is not normal, "in which she announced a new section called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"there will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything, however, deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the category" War in Rio. "(...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists don't close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, explained that this decision is not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war effort in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist of the newspaper declares that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial, the newspaper writes:"</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, when it is distorted, can also be used to cover the atrocities of the police who first shoots and then asks questions."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption by the police, whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira argues to designate violence as a" war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as shown in the analysis of military interest rates in Rio itself - in combination with inadequate investments in personnel, education and a historical and self-pleasing neglect of public service."</seg>
<seg id="2774">Remember: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">"according to Cecília, Rio de Janeiro is wrong:" 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the most up-to-date data available. "</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>

<seg id="2780">"the company Globo is one of the largest media companies in South America, which, as Cecília has underlined, has been repeating the state's security policy for years."</seg>
<seg id="2781">"these security policy measures included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit imposed by the federal state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to conquer a Favela by using a massive police station and permanently stationing it there."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually led to a decrease in violent deaths."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles in 2010, in which he explains why violence in Rio does not conform to the criteria for the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for the people."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"this requires the state to use means and ways which are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a" "enemy", "where a zivilist is an unknown point in the landscape and becomes the object for" "collateral damage" "and" "lost balls". ""</seg>
<seg id="2787">"war or her, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer."</seg>
<seg id="2788">"a week ago, the police had climbed up the hill with the Favela Jacarzinho to avenge the death of a police officer."</seg>

<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila said Global Voices, that they began the" production of fungal seeds "from the regions before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>
<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub. as this succeeded, they used a larger tub. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">"since the beginning of the project and after further 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Ghouta."</seg>

<seg id="2833">"on 21 October, several hundred people protested in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires raving in the north of Portugal in the week before."</seg>
<seg id="2834">"forty-two persons died, and some 70 were injured following the forest fires of the 15th and 16th October. this led to the fact that the government called for the last week out of solidarity with the victims for three days."</seg>
<seg id="2835">"fires have also been registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 dead."</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire eruptions spreading in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite pictures alone, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in 2017 alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon District."</seg>

<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country toward Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Ashark found herself in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked in a coal mine for a few years. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his low wages, and went to Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than he himself in order to earn his livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"at that time, like today, Afghan refugees in Iran were characterized by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we hung nylon from the open windows so that we do not freeze at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous crossing of the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time Asharaf was homeless, ran only through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church, who distributed food to the needy twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that, due to relatively high level of growth rates, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is true that the conditions of asylum seekers in the country are disastrous."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "special reception centres". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they officially submitted an application to asylum - which can go for months after the registration of the asylum application."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who have no money for accommodation, either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
