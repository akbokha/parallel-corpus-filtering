this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
&quot; long before someone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally heard teleph@@ ones from Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic American intelligence operation , in which the CIA rendered literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not like the chapter at all ?
the US government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has identified cra@@ cks and urged him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and to spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right , if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect identity of the brave they reveal . &quot;
&quot; so when the government arrived at Ris@@ en , he did something that many cour@@ age@@ ous repor@@ ters had already done before him : he refused , saying that he would rather go to jail . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , even though they were for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped on cra@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; the reason : in the era of electronic surveillance , repor@@ ters and sources can hide less and less . &quot;
&quot; instead of separ@@ ators and cra@@ cks to make statements , it could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have secre@@ tly taken care of his telephone numbers , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its loan agreement , and even travel cards with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , CIA W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government pic@@ ks too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional order , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they can take this from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ spect , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today , there are communication software that didn &apos;t exist when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source analysis system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet fame , the Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news site , as is the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload or send documents , as in any ordinary contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government cannot obtain any more information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all . &quot;
&quot; it is to be sure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to kill mis@@ deeds . it is equally important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
or the next environmental employee who suggests alarm for contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall street insi@@ der that war@@ ns us ahead of the next financial crisis .
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the biggest data rec@@ t@@ angle of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to firms such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
&quot; also , there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad has in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that a trace of $ 2 billion to Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are anxi@@ ous to wait for the next release , and to the next revealed documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the P@@ lot of a Agent@@ enth@@ r@@ iller or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
&quot; it seems we@@ eping away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should this be done ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are capable of hiding their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not paying all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this concerns all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosec@@ uting and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters . &quot;
I find it also interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA .
&quot; presum@@ ably , because there were no prominent Americans so far , which occurred in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; however , by the principle of which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data l@@ eck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is that in some US states less information needs to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip school children .
it has allowed che@@ aters to rip off particularly sus@@ cep@@ tible investors .
it is this type of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investigation into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspic@@ ious money to the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really shock@@ ed it , that all up to a lawyer made proposals to our investig@@ ator , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; none of these lawyers accepted us as clients , and of course no one was handed over to anybody . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investigation .
it is not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to overcome this , we need to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
&quot; this may sound very sad , as if we could do nothing against it , as if nothing could ever change , as if there is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot to change . &quot;
&quot; in the last few years , we have seen violations of more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU has recorded in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the United States lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both Parliament chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people who will be angry , when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ light companies . &quot;
we need managers in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this type of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot;
&quot; together we can finally finish the in@@ transparency , which now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story of how I almost kid@@ n@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made a sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stood and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . after that he would go to peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the Corps of Peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans this . I don &apos;t want to end up in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
&quot; then I stopped saying , &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; Oh , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I burn up there ? &quot;
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such fear that I got out of bed , sh@@ ook to@@ e @-@ tips to the door and shut down my sleeping room door . &quot;
but he was not mad at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me is hanging today in his classroom . he is now teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my point of view completely .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold as strangers in childhood , actually friends who were just waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s make a jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost pl@@ ast@@ ly , my ro@@ ommate is moving and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I think , creativity can create it to transform fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; &quot; Brian , I thought how we could make something to do with it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars on the air mattress .
they loved it and we too .
&quot; I &apos;m sure , our Che@@ ese ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ ettes ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door was falling into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
&quot; my former ro@@ ommate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if one could make a business concept .
&quot; so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a site on which people post images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room , whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the ro@@ cket to ign@@ ite .
&quot; indeed , they do not . &quot;
nobody who is still at Tro@@ st would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you can look at the things you can do well . we could design . &quot;
&quot; at the Academy of Arts , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the total experience . &quot;
&quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met before . &quot;
can design do something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree trust we asp@@ ire .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone your left sitting neighbour .
this silent flight of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locking mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
so also most guests feel if they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
only time so who now actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is chann@@ eling for the office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had first introduced himself with his name , if he had told wh@@ ence he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
&quot; imagine you would have 150 ass@@ essments , all say : &quot; &quot; he really can hold good un@@ locked cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system enhances trust .
at the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to give off negative jud@@ gements .
finally we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had submitted their reviews before we placed them online .
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we studied how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are about age and residence . &quot;
little surprisingly we trust the people most that are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ essments .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation stems from simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that confidence depends on how much you get from yourself . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; Hi , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells a lot , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your home ! I make holiday with my family . &quot; &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company relies on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we had not expected was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put off these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; thir@@ dly , a need that had not been covered before . &quot;
&quot; for us , the business runs very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or demoli@@ shed apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the dis@@ appointment you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve .
fortunately from the 123 million overnight stays only a fraction was ever a problem .
for men trust one another rightly .
&quot; if trust works , won@@ dro@@ us can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his judgement :
perfect home for travelers who tend to tend to heart attack due to sed@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives even though they don &apos;t know them properly .
&quot; you drive in your own car to the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you feel lon@@ ely , they bring books over . &quot;
you can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so of course not every stay will exp@@ ire .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is about economic trading .
&quot; but now simply call &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the matter is not fair . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
&quot; people place a part of themselves open , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; when you travel today , it &apos;s easy to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic . &quot;
what if traveling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what if at any place you visited , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show a neighborhood where you have never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would arrange apartments from the ground up to sharing ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would assume the thought of common participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , rather than sol@@ itude and isolation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already been started . many parking spaces belonging to the government &quot;
&quot; now , residents were offered . students who were looking for a stay , were offered &quot;
&quot; were medi@@ ated to people whose children were with@@ drawn . incub@@ ators were launched , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host . &quot;
so the idea seems not to be so crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was also hospitality before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why has just ours worked ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I think it is amazing , &quot;
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
of course we know that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay at the airport security check .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media portra@@ y people that look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a car@@ rot @-@ fitness @-@ fan@@ atic , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so . &quot;
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old I decided to ou@@ ten .
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head@@ gear . &quot;
my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and compared to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , I felt a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not just accepted the faith of my parents .
I have strug@@ gl@@ ed with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought , posed in question , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion which deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; ever had you felt that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
that &apos;s how it feels .
&quot; later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot; &quot;
&quot; smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people j@@ umped from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly into rebellion .
why should I do something like that ?
&quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ji@@ had ... , ... &quot; ... &quot; m@@ ashed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the actions of others turned me into a susp@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to go through the Mid@@ west of the United States to move into a new city and start the post@@ graduate course . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I drove -- when we drove sil@@ ently -- as deep as I went into my seat , and I was the first time to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we stayed at this night in our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; lead in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Do not com@@ fy yourselves . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it became Friday at that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again the war@@ nings were : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims , or by people , who were for Muslims , drag@@ ged and sm@@ ashed . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I have got the anger of the people to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love issues . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are tough .
&quot; today , we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tumor in the United States .
only the question arises : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour can only be observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is false .
&quot; Muslims like all other Americans , no tumor in the US body , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , drow@@ sin@@ ers and Olympics . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques of America be safer ?
&quot; there may be a few parking spaces , but not stop terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to look more toler@@ ant to people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater ci@@ vic participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington , DC area recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alized in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the radic@@ alization process one found that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even by their family , so that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ liked by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a man , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add ourselves to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
&quot; the IS has so much to do with Islam , such as K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity . &quot;
both groups claim their ideology background on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but when looking at them , they don &apos;t exagger@@ ate what they read in their &quot; Sacred Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the Scriptures .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pret@@ ended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy , with whom she had spoken , brought her to silence , and told her that her wrath , her sense of un@@ righteousness in the world , would only bring it into difficulties . &quot;
&quot; nothing inspired and something that would have made sense to their anger , it was a major goal for instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution . &quot;
this ima@@ m re@@ affir@@ med the connection to God and its church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed its constructive ways for real change in the world . &quot;
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from close to the IS .
this was an insight as to how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia concerns me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : when we fear that at least three things happen .
&quot; we rather accept an author@@ itative governing system , conformity and prejudi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study shows that if man reports news in which negative Muslims were reported , they were more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look when the mood against Muslims fell upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq War and during two electoral periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public , to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts all of us . &quot;
&quot; in the assignment of collective guilt , it is not only about having to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was at the Faculty of Medicine , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was aston@@ ished and said :
&quot; when has I become such a sealed young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as in a execution , after he posted remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he spent eight times at De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about what America we want to give to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely ex@@ ert our religion . &quot;
we decided for the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we drove silence , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; when I took him out , my shoes went out , and went into the building hall , and what I saw was stopped . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers , and non @-@ believers who had come , not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I am collap@@ sing . &quot;
these people were there because they had brought courage and compassion panic and prejudi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who mean : we are better than those .
many thanks .
thank you very much !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I ask myself , what do you say to those who perhaps claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght are working in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say : don &apos;t dec@@ eive yourself . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; looking at the Muslims around the world , and I did so with the greatest ever @-@ conducted study of Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to rule . &quot;
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a multi @-@ billion dollar business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; before air parcel delivery has entered our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the F@@ RAC Centre in France live a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . a few years ago , they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting flights , flight devices achieve high speed and acceleration in confined spaces . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ winding structures .
&quot; they have learned to bear loads , deal with turbul@@ ences and generally react to laws of nature . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of the possible in autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must know coll@@ ectively where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
&quot; for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , calculate calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available on the highest level , e. g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear starter , &quot;
a flight device that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most of the starter blades it can float , and thus has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a restriction of hed@@ ge@@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences such as wind arches .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight device no matter what position the optimal position is reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that get to the heart of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts , which join to hurt you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots flying remote controlled flying machines that had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
we discovered long ago that flies are working with only one .
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no valves , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ des , no further actu@@ ator or controller surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , it happens very much in the inner life so that it can fly stable and move in the room over all@@ round . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it right correctly . &quot;
&quot; the lik@@ el@@ ihood of throwing it right when all see me is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was fil@@ med last night . &quot;
&quot; when the monster is an exercise in pleas@@ ant@@ ness , this machine is here , the om@@ er with his eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is not symmet@@ rical .
therefore it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some can be seen in models , the rest is lear@@ ns directly when flying . &quot;
let &apos;s look at this .
&quot; when planes are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine here consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates in c@@ lock@@ wise direction
and the other against c@@ lock@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller is falling , the electronics or a battery -- can further fly the machine if limited . &quot;
we will now demonstrate this by making a half @-@ air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration investigated synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a wide range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each individual weighs less than one sli@@ ce of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there is a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology .
for types like us lies the wage in the development and the act of creativity .
&quot; it serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that there are creative , clever creatures allowed to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very distant galax@@ y , so the mass of three suns were transformed into pure energy in a tenth of a second . &quot;
for this short moment they lit bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
finally we speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time frame itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us arrange the events for a time .
&quot; at 1.3 billion years ago , a number of days ago was created on the earth . &quot;
&quot; since then , the Earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is standing up to us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago a group decided especially cour@@ age@@ ous -- R@@ ai White from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- a huge laser detector , to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which occur around colli@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most people considered them crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work , they built the detector lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ shaft Observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following period , the precision of lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which significantly improved the recognition output . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes prop@@ elled through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell of my death @-@ sick father .
&quot; basically , they were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their through observ@@ atories as lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cl@@ utter in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when moving the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustration , lec@@ turers often perform a properly al@@ ber@@ ing dance in courses of rel@@ ativity theory . &quot;
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14th , for example , each one of us was stretched and st@@ ened by us at the meeting of the waves . the el@@ on@@ gation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by one . therefore , one declared the Lig@@ o staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re laser detector , and that &apos;s absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about grav@@ itation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are fin@@ ish@@ able , and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim , Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye . &quot;
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because so you can customize a picture or map of things by watching the light coming from several points around you . &quot;
&quot; in case of sounds , it is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that would mean you a lot : &quot;
about the face of your child .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind . &quot;
&quot; now , just Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob breaks them down . &quot;
&quot; sil@@ ly Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot create simple images of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe . &quot;
&quot; to listen to the gravity , tell us about the colli@@ sion of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circul@@ ate simply : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; if the two bodies turn very fast , you hear the same chir@@ ping with an additional key change . this sounds like the wu &quot; wu &quot; wu &quot; wu &quot; &quot; wu &quot; &quot; wu &quot; &quot; wu &quot; &quot; wu &quot; &quot; wu &quot; &quot; wu &quot; &quot; wu &quot; &quot; wu &quot; &quot; wu &quot; &quot; wu &quot; &quot; wu &quot; &quot; wu &quot; &quot; wu &quot; &quot; wu &quot; &quot; wu &quot; &quot; in the wu district . &quot;
&quot; it is a type of movement , embos@@ sed in the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date which at least I will never forget -- heard Lig@@ o : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des No@@ ise &#93; Som@@ ebody who knows what he needs to hear , recognize this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which rotate approximately as fast as the bars of your mixer . &quot;
AA : think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve hundred times a second before they colli@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know that because we have heard it .
therein lies the abi@@ ding meaning of Lig@@ o .
&quot; Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe , as it was never before . &quot;
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the un@@ seen .
&quot; much in space , we can &apos;t see -- practical or basically -- not . &quot;
&quot; a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ y stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . we learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; the exciting physical processes happen , however , at the core that is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through as these op@@ aque are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them because the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own flash@@ light . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen , which we have never seen and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Lig@@ o found in the first attempt to do things that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes , like Lig@@ o , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . black holes are the su@@ ckers for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o allows us a completely different angle to the events in space , to the formation of the stars and ultimately on how we came out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; one year long I would say &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , bringing me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be on TV live ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing with the play ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I feared , my fear removed . &quot;
&quot; my fear to keep speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply to an un@@ expect@@ edly kind . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Em@@ erson . and Em@@ erson , the smallest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; kit@@ ties , &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my be@@ ak sau@@ cer . &quot;
she asked her if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; from there on , I am s@@ worn to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I do , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I understood completely that the &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; say to play with my children saved my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think about things you are thinking about .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce TV .
&quot; I make television , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV sen@@ ders can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes simultaneously in production , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes simultaneously in production , four episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series are running on Thursday evening .
&quot; all over the world , my series is running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I created myself , and not only produced , so on top of it . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who is doing that ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I say to you , that all of you who work so hard if you are running a company , a country or a class room , a business or a household , take me seriously if I say of work , so that you understand that I &apos;m not just walking around on the computer and fan@@ ta@@ si@@ ere , and it &apos;s true when I say : I don &apos;t understand that it &apos;s not about dre@@ aming at a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I &apos;m deep@@ ened in my work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
&quot; it is , when I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as a medium , you have a high tone , loop a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and uns@@ ett@@ ling , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best of it is the sum . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is running well .
&quot; a hum@@ ming begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could always drive on it . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I declare to them the sums that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing gives me joy . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it . &quot;
&quot; but the sum -- when I began to work and work with television production , when I began working and working , building , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . the sum ! &quot;
the sum is more than writing .
the sum is action and activity . the sum is a drug .
the tot@@ em is music . the tot@@ em is light and air .
the tot@@ em is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , you can &apos;t asp@@ ire to be different . &quot;
&quot; the feeling of not being able to asp@@ ire to size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is what is called the sum .
or perhaps it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of pre@@ failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I am not for failure , and I just know that I love the sums . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things at the same time , the more I write history , the more expectations are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high tone , the sum , the sums , the sums . &quot;
I like this sum . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the sum .
am I only this sum ?
and then the sums stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , burned out . &quot;
the tot@@ em stopped .
now my three daughters are ac@@ custom@@ ed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single work .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people , &quot; My mo@@ m will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Em@@ erson says : &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da land . &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums ceased . &quot;
the tot@@ em of the engine was spe@@ ech@@ less .
I no longer loved my work . the engine was out of it .
the sums did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as usual : the same tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan sleeps not , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sums .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a preview Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I simply had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum and the sums I was .
&quot; so what do you do , if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ ades away ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; how@@ l you , stupid author @-@ titanium . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do it , you &apos;re working to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , one loves to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates . &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
&quot; and then my &quot; &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot;
&quot; I am on the way to the outside , late turn and she says : &quot; &quot; m@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me : &quot;
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she called me not &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot;
she calls no more &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan bin and my bu@@ zz is bet@@ ting , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and her sisters meet , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding , because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of hum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl is releasing in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air at this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that &apos;s not right away , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sum is slowly coming back .
&quot; no full volume , barely there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the thing .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the sums of work , the Tit@@ an@@ ens@@ um@@ men , this is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am when I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and TV hours and how dys@@ functional my brain is , then I forgot what the actual sum is . &quot;
the sum is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on joy .
the real sum is dependent on love .
the sum is the stream that comes from lust for life .
the true tot@@ em is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real sums ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be completed , the expectation and pressure . &quot;
the real sum@@ ming is simple and original .
&quot; the real sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic from all guilt . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to listen to the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
there is no way to play with me as we work .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer at work than at home .
&quot; this conc@@ ession is painful , because what kind of person would prefer to be a house ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
&quot; we swi@@ f@@ tly around in the garden , in front and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always att@@ une to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever stop playing ?
&quot; you can also say yes , if your child wants to play with you . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you consider me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dream . &quot;
&quot; you probably have a right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or bis@@ cuit is replaced .
&quot; and talking my teen@@ age daughter for about 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more it does not need . &quot;
&quot; everyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece , even at a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes a piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no clothes , no dist@@ ra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to finish . &quot;
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is necessary to feel the sums of having a place for peace of mind . &quot;
&quot; it is not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure , &quot;
around the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find it out and save it .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I fail and I si@@ ege . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in training , when I wanted to exceed myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the track why not treat yourself to 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the sum came back in my spare time . the sum seems to return if I do not work .
work does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , she fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sums , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my sum .
the tot@@ em of life .
the tot@@ em of love .
&quot; the sum of labor is part of me , but only a part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s nice to me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and more playing .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the sum , the sums , the other , the right sum : the sum of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum , the more this unusual , lasting , naked and new feeling of life makes me wide . less titanium -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am a writer . I think of things I am getting to life .
&quot; this is a job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ am@@ ful .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and to play more . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke or after an accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability for self healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions by means of various surgical measures .
&quot; surely , they have heard of one of the most known , the &quot; &quot; deep brain stimulation &quot; . &quot; thereby , one electro@@ de deeply im@@ planted in the brain to influence the neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function is improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson who suffered from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ He@@ aling . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I supplied patients with skull trau@@ ma trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that the brain weak@@ ens the brain and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
&quot; to save life , one must decrease the skull pressure . &quot;
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to let cells grow from a tissue return , it is similar to very small children who are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; it is necessary to find proper nutrition , temperature , moisture and environments to thri@@ ve . &quot;
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it made Jean @-@ François .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; you may also know from the studies of biology that stem cells are imm@@ ac@@ ulate cells , which can turn into every cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they are very fast .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our grand @-@ brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage they care for the folding of the brain .
but why are they preserved ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations . &quot;
&quot; however , this is not so safe . &quot;
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells . &quot;
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingual area , and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did . &quot;
and then highlight colour in order to be able to trace them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we rec@@ alled it at the t@@ apping point of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ ologist transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re @-@ c@@ anti@@ ate these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we have re @-@ incar@@ cer@@ ate the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario , we passed the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared , as if they had been removed , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we added a violation and re @-@ established exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells which have been re @-@ incar@@ n@@ ated .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we dy@@ ed in vitro and in culture .
&quot; here , of course , we could not stop . &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
&quot; when they had reached a stable level of skill , we were injured in the motor @-@ sensor area in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen to people , they spontane@@ ously recovered to a certain degree , just like a stroke . &quot;
&quot; the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover some degree , just like the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
on the left you see the monkey that spontane@@ ously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now see , when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found much more about these cells .
we can fre@@ eze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to impl@@ ant them in humans .
I really hope I can show you soon how the human brain gives the means to heal itself .
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Giuss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know somebody who can take this . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one has to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this kind of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : it is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a fast professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : take a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to choose the patients , perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , it is necessary to apply it to a multi @-@ centric study . &quot;
first you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you told us about it . &quot;
&quot; BG , thank you very much . &quot;
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider it as imm@@ utable fav@@ ours .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ le@@ v from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have clearly demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; in fact , democracy dis@@ appears with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence austerity programs that were carried out in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my honest friends who told me that democracy would aboli@@ sh if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , in common with me to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a wrong belief , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ sible democracy . &quot;
&quot; because without democracy , our societies are dar@@ ing , our future d@@ ü@@ ster and our great new technologies are w@@ asted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatened by our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , who th@@ rows his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all know the debt mountain , &quot;
but few recognise his twin .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the wealthy spar@@ ks and corporations , who are too anxi@@ ous to invest in it , where it would be productive and produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past three months in the United States , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3.4 tril@@ lion dollars were invested in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , rail@@ roads , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tril@@ lion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until one compar@@ es it with the 5,@@ 1 tril@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , save the stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit , which are not compens@@ ated by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result are stagn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand that would boost the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors in which they do not invest in which they would not invest . &quot;
&quot; invol@@ un@@ tarily , the circumstances lead to the fact that O@@ edi@@ pus k@@ ills him . &quot;
that is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; all this un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop our lives and to finance especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial to the rescue of the Earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
&quot; of course , the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy included too many . &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy on account of these exclusi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the crucial part of the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy was and is that they were involved in the working arms , and not only giving them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and crucial that they grant them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal m@@ oods in questions of state interests . &quot;
the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy has not held long ago --
&quot; like a candle , which g@@ lows very bright , it is also quickly burned out . &quot;
&quot; however , today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not rooted their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible , and the democratic process was del@@ im@@ ited into politics , while the economy -- the world of corporations -- became a democracy @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , the economy gradually sub@@ mits politics and depri@@ ved them of it . &quot;
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not due to a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is important to be in the government today , and yet it is not in power because the power is dispos@@ ed of by politics into the economy and the areas are separate . &quot;
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , that sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which it nour@@ ishes itself , that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that has ri@@ vul@@ sed politics so far that it is decl@@ ining itself by the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods will be dispos@@ ed of , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are too sc@@ ary to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that &apos;s true , it is obvious that we need to bring the politics and the economy back together and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; retain control , as in ancient Athens , except for the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the teaching of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : to aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is that so long business and politics are separate areas , automation acceler@@ ates the tw@@ ins , the wast@@ eful@@ ness , and social conflicts lower , as it -- already very soon , as I believe -- will come in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we must res@@ h@@ ape the economy and re @-@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and ensure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ogenic hyper@@ auto@@ cracy that lets the film &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; seem like a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is not , therefore , whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced . &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; , &quot; which is similar to that of &quot; &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; in which machines are used to people and people put their energy into the research of the universe , or to indul@@ ge in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in a nut@@ shell . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies , please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from one company to another , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those currently working in the company . &quot;
then all income derived from capital and rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work therein , and employees working there that the company does not belong . no more exchange between capital and labour , no great gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately not a por@@ ous twin summit . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the net income of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are ra@@ r . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have , in particular , against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is at the same time the secretary in which they preferred privileged persons , and Marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
but above all else it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will awake in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thanks .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and business is ... Do we not do this , the technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers den@@ otes a &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the world to the next , as we are currently experiencing it , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant . &quot;
&quot; just like Hay@@ ek , that is why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are well . &quot;
Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ r you don &apos;t think enough .
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a sort of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein who said this . BG : in your talk , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of speakers you have clearly said what you think of the West &apos;s view of China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain sense , if I can say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century . &quot;
because -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake in history .
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was very scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what can be seen in China now resembles the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China now pret@@ ending to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ elled tremend@@ ously to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I suppose that this is coming .
BG :
how do you look back six months later for the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; namely to say good@@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive reduction in exploitation proce@@ eded massi@@ vely by the euro@@ zone and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have still elected den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it might be a while to delay , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you expect ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- seri@@ ousness ...
&quot; if there is a Minister of Finance , or any minister who is in office after 6 months , particularly in such a ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they just wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that went through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to conc@@ ede that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for five years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the Great Depression .
none of the Troika of the len@@ ders who imposed this policy was : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal error .
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be still pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone vis @-@ à @-@ vis a person who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
&quot; for if it does not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and the European Union will destroy . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to embar@@ k on the way of a post@@ modern 1930 , after which it seems to me , it will be equally toler@@ able for the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
&quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot;
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TE@@ D . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; most have never heard of Roy Price , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ g and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and contents that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought branch . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select any .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the site , IMDB . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows have received this review . &quot;
&quot; will your show be valued at nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ted , where after one has looked a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what goes off at the end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the average charge , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite . &quot;
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing so , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where they can watch everyone free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon out for nothing , do you access right ? &quot;
millions of viewers are watching these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you can capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p or check again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide with these data to determine which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com via four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does someone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . &quot;
&quot; instead of organizing a competition , he and his team watched the existing data on Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the ratings they give the shows , their course , which shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together they had a car , and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has thus landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what has happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
why is that ?
because logic somehow states that it should work in everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
one has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you optimize it with very powerful computers .
&quot; what you can expect is good television , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work so , this is something terri@@ fying because we live in a time in which we take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions far beyond the television . &quot;
does anyone know the Multi @-@ Health Systems company here ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come in touch with it in prison .
&quot; if someone is in prison here and asks for dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it &apos;s decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; medium @-@ sized television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always generating the best results . that &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most accomplished firms are wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it could be predic@@ ated by data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the aw@@ ful way -- by analyzing the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderful and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked just fine , year around year until it suddenly no longer worked , &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data from the most accomplished firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data streams directly into decisions of life -- at work , in legal enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very smart people use in@@ conceivable many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
first dis@@ assemble this problem into its parts so you can analyze the items ; as a second you put the items together to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to res@@ onate parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for that and we all own it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete , to then touch a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful , because they have used data and minds , where they belong also in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , what they otherwise would not have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all these parts , put together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision .
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did so in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they compet@@ ed around TV ideas , then selecting &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
before there was data this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; it &apos;s also called &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a J@@ e- or No @-@ issue you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; highly likely &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot;
I will f@@ use it later with a technology demo .
&quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life , where I should have listened to the ball in retro@@ spect . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; eventually , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data , it still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what you are doing , and risks . &quot;
&quot; because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
