<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally heard telephones from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes a catastrophic American intelligence operation, in which the CIA rendered literally drafts for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not like the chapter at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has identified cracks and urged him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblower and to spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right, if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect identity of the brave they reveal."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government arrived at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused, saying that he would rather go to jail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, even though they were for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped on cracks."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason: in the era of electronic surveillance, reporters and sources can hide less and less."</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of separators and cracks to make statements, it could also do its digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, have secretly taken care of his telephone numbers,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, its loan agreement, and even travel cards with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, CIA Whistleblower and Risen's supposed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government picks too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional order, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in fact, they can take this from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today, there are communication software that didn't exist when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source analysis system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet fame, the Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news site, as is the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload or send documents, as in any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot obtain any more information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that jeopardize us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to be sure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snowden have a chance to kill misdeeds. it is equally important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">Or the next environmental employee who suggests alarm for contaminated water from Flint. or a Wall street insider that warns us ahead of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the biggest data rectangle of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers"] [What does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] [What does that mean?] [What does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] [What does that mean?] [What does that mean?] [What does that mean?] [What does that mean?] [What does that mean?] [What does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] [What does that mean?] [What does that mean?] [What does that mean?] [What does that mean?] [What does that mean?] [What does that mean?] [What does that mean?] [What does that mean?] [What does that mean?] [What does that mean?] [What does that mean?] [What does that mean?] [What does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] [What does that mean?] [What does that mean?] [What does that mean?] [What does that mean?] [What does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to firms such as Mossack Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad has in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a trace of $2 billion to Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are anxious to wait for the next release, and to the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the Plot of a Agententhriller or a John Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems weeping away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this be done?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are capable of hiding their wealth in tax havens and not paying all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"all over the world, media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and disguise -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecuting and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it also interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there were no prominent Americans so far, which occurred in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, by the principle of which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is that in some US states less information needs to provide less information to establish a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed cheaters to rip off particularly susceptible investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this type of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigation into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked it, that all up to a lawyer made proposals to our investigator, how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers accepted us as clients, and of course no one was handed over to anybody. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigation.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single top politician involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to overcome this, we need to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very sad, as if we could do nothing against it, as if nothing could ever change, as if there is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a born optimist, I see quite a lot to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in the last few years, we have seen violations of more transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has recorded in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the United States lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both Parliament chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who will be angry, when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headlight companies."</seg>
<seg id="93">We need managers in the economy that stand up and say: "intransparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this type of intransparency by laws."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally finish the intransparency, which now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design studies, I made a sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stood and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. after that he would go to peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the Corps of Peace, but I don't know if he really plans this. I don't want to end up in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"then I stopped saying," "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "Oh, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "Oh man! what did I burn up there?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such fear that I got out of bed, shook toe-tips to the door and shut down my sleeping room door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me is hanging today in his classroom. he is now teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my point of view completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold as strangers in childhood, actually friends who were just waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's make a jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost plastly, my roommate is moving and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I think, creativity can create it to transform fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky:" "Brian, I thought how we could make something to do with it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, including a mattress and every morning breakfast."</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars on the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="131">They loved it and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I'm sure, our Cheese ham-Omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door was falling into the castle, Brian and I stared."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"so we presented the investors:" we want to create a site on which people post images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of room, whose doors are closed when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they do not."</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still at Trost would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you can look at the things you can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Academy of Arts, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the total experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree trust we aspire.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone your left sitting neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent flight of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocking mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also most guests feel if they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only time so who now actually has Al Gores mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is channeling for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had first introduced himself with his name, if he had told whence he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine you would have 150 assessments, all say:" "he really can hold good unlocked cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system enhances trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to give off negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had submitted their reviews before we placed them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we studied how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are about age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust the people most that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stems from similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that confidence depends on how much you get from yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, such as" Hi, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells a lot, for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" Tolle works of art in your home! I make holiday with my family. ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company relies on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we had not expected was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put off these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"thirdly, a need that had not been covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business runs very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or demolished apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment you hear in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately from the 123 million overnight stays only a fraction was ever a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For men trust one another rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust works, wondrous can arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgement:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect home for travelers who tend to tend to heart attack due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives even though they don't know them properly.</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive in your own car to the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you feel lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So of course not every stay will expire.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about economic trading.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now simply call" "rental industry", "the matter is not fair."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">"people place a part of themselves open, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel today, it's easy to compare with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">What if traveling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place you visited, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show a neighborhood where you have never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would arrange apartments from the ground up to sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would assume the thought of common participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships, rather than solitude and isolation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already been started. many parking spaces belonging to the government"</seg>
<seg id="240">"now, residents were offered. students who were looking for a stay, were offered"</seg>
<seg id="241">"were mediated to people whose children were withdrawn. incubators were launched,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems not to be so crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just ours worked?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I think it is amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course we know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder why we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the airport security check.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media portray people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Muslim, it's great to get to know you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a carrot-fitness-fanatic,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I decided to outen.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my headgear."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist girlfriends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, and compared to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old, I felt a perfect and unreachable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not just accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have struggled with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, posed in question, doubted and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion which deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes makes me cry.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"ever had you felt that someone perceives you, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked on the screen and saw the word" breaking news. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people jumped from the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the TV channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists... "..." in the name of Islam... "..."... "..."... "" jihad...,... "..." mashed Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it has not only been attacked by my country, but in the Nu the actions of others turned me into a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to go through the Midwest of the United States to move into a new city and start the postgraduate course."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I drove -- when we drove silently -- as deep as I went into my seat, and I was the first time to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we stayed at this night in our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" be watchful, "" Be careful, "" Be careful, "" lead in well lit areas, "" Do not comfy yourselves. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it became Friday at that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings were:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims, or by people, who were for Muslims, dragged and smashed."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have got the anger of the people to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love issues."</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are tough.</seg>
<seg id="320">"today, we can actually hear people say:" there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as of a tumor in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumour can only be observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims like all other Americans, no tumor in the US body, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, drowsiners and Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques of America be safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there may be a few parking spaces, but not stop terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to look more tolerant to people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington, DC area recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radicalization process one found that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even by their family, so that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or disliked by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a man, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">"the IS has so much to do with Islam, such as Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity."</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology background on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when looking at them, they don't exaggerate what they read in their" Sacred Scripture. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy, with whom she had spoken, brought her to silence, and told her that her wrath, her sense of unrighteousness in the world, would only bring it into difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="350">"nothing inspired and something that would have made sense to their anger, it was a major goal for instrumentalization by extremists who promised a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam reaffirmed the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed its constructive ways for real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from close to the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight as to how the Islamophobia concerns me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: when we fear that at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritative governing system, conformity and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows that if man reports news in which negative Muslims were reported, they were more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look when the mood against Muslims fell upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq War and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public, to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear hurts all of us."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the assignment of collective guilt, it is not only about having to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the Faculty of Medicine, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was astonished and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when has I become such a sealed young man from my brother?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as in a execution, after he posted remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He spent eight times at Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was about what America we want to give to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exert our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child's seat, we drove silence, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"when I took him out, my shoes went out, and went into the building hall, and what I saw was stopped."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers, and non-believers who had come, not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">"at this moment, I am collapsing."</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had brought courage and compassion panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who mean: we are better than those.</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a multi-billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air parcel delivery has entered our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRAC Centre in France live a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks. a few years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting flights, flight devices achieve high speed and acceleration in confined spaces."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-winding structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to bear loads, deal with turbulences and generally react to laws of nature."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of the possible in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to work autonomously, it must know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room."</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, calculate calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available on the highest level, e. g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most of the starter blades it can float, and thus has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of hedgestarters is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind arches.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight device no matter what position the optimal position is regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that get to the heart of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts, which join to hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots flying remote controlled flying machines that had only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered long ago that flies are working with only one.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanically simple remote-operated flight device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a moving part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no valves, hinges and transverse rudes, no further actuator or controller surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, it happens very much in the inner life so that it can fly stable and move in the room over allround."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern-starters. to bring it to flying, I have to throw it right correctly."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood of throwing it right when all see me is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the monster is an exercise in pleasantness, this machine is here, the omer with his eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is not symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, he receives the extraordinary ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even rotated."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the field of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some can be seen in models, the rest is learns directly when flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at this.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when planes are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates in clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller is falling, the electronics or a battery -- can further fly the machine if limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making a half-airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigated synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a wide range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopter -- each individual weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine there is a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the wage in the development and the act of creativity.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that there are creative, clever creatures allowed to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very distant galaxy, so the mass of three suns were transformed into pure energy in a tenth of a second."</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they lit brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">Finally we speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time frame itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events for a time.</seg>
<seg id="476">"at 1.3 billion years ago, a number of days ago was created on the earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then, the Earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is standing up to us -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago a group decided especially courageous -- Rai White from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- a huge laser detector, to look for gravitational waves, which occur around colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most people considered them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work, they built the detector ligo: the laser-interferometer gravitational-shaft Observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following period, the precision of ligo could be significantly increased, which significantly improved the recognition output."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes propelled through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell of my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, they were the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and their through observatories as ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a clutter in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when moving the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustration, lecturers often perform a properly albering dance in courses of relativity theory."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14th, for example, each one of us was stretched and stened by us at the meeting of the waves. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by one. therefore, one declared the Ligo staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre laser detector, and that's absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are finishable, and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim, Ligo is more an ear than an eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical, because so you can customize a picture or map of things by watching the light coming from several points around you."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in case of sounds, it is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that would mean you a lot:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob breaks them down."</seg>
<seg id="516">"silly Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot create simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe."</seg>
<seg id="522">"to listen to the gravity, tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circulate simply: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"if the two bodies turn very fast, you hear the same chirping with an additional key change. this sounds like the wu" wu "wu" wu "" wu "" wu "" wu "" wu "" wu "" wu "" wu "" wu "" wu "" wu "" wu "" wu "" wu "" wu "" wu "" in the wu district. "</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a type of movement, embossed in the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date which at least I will never forget -- heard Ligo: [Surrendes Noise] Somebody who knows what he needs to hear, recognize this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold sun mass, which rotate approximately as fast as the bars of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know that because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the abiding meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">"Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe, as it was never before."</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the unseen.</seg>
<seg id="535">"much in space, we can't see -- practical or basically -- not."</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massery stars explode in super-novae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes happen, however, at the core that is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through as these opaque are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them because the Big Bang is covered by its own flashlight."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen, which we have never seen and of which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"indeed, Ligo found in the first attempt to do things that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that bring black holes, like Ligo, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. black holes are the suckers for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo allows us a completely different angle to the events in space, to the formation of the stars and ultimately on how we came out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried out an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"one year long I would say" "Yes!" "I was afraid of."</seg>
<seg id="556">"no matter if it made me nervous, bringing me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say" yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing with the play?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I feared, my fear removed."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear to keep speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply to an unexpectedly kind. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls for inexplicable reasons all" kitties, "</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kitten, I need milk for my beak saucer."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked her if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from there on, I am sworn to play with them whenever you ask me. no matter what I do, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I am very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, to my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I understood completely that the" "yes" "say to play with my children saved my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think about things you are thinking about.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV senders can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes simultaneously in production, four television programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes simultaneously in production, four episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series are running on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series is running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I created myself, and not only produced, so on top of it. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire that burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with that.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think when the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say to you, that all of you who work so hard if you are running a company, a country or a class room, a business or a household, take me seriously if I say of work, so that you understand that I'm not just walking around on the computer and fantasiere, and it's true when I say: I don't understand that it's not about dreaming at a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I'm deepened in my work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I set up troops, as I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a medium, you have a high tone, loop a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and unsettling, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best of it is the sum."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is running well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a humming begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy street, I could always drive on it."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I declare to them the sums that I'm talking about writing that writing gives me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, that does it."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sum -- when I began to work and work with television production, when I began working and working, building, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy. the sum!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sum is action and activity. the sum is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The totem is music. the totem is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The totem is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sum, you can't aspire to be different."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling of not being able to aspire to size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is what is called the sum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of prefailure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I am not for failure, and I just know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know that I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more things at the same time, the more I write history, the more expectations are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high tone, the sum, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overloaded, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The totem stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single work.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people," My mom will not be there, but you can write my nanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The totem of the engine was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="650">I no longer loved my work. the engine was out of it.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did the same things as usual: the same titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a Titan sleeps not, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a preview Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I simply had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sum and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do, if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fades away?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "howl you, stupid author-titanium."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you do it, you're working to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, one loves to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates."</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">"and then my" "southern state waitress" "asks me a question."</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way to the outside, late turn and she says:" "mum, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I want to say no, when two things become aware of me:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she called me not" kitten. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no more "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am Titan bin and my buzz is betting, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mama, do you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters meet, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding, because my pain and panic, in loneliness and in the absence of humming, I can't do anything except to watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the land I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl is releasing in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that's not right away, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sum is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, barely there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sum."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the thing.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the sums of work, the Titanensummen, this is just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am when I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and TV hours and how dysfunctional my brain is, then I forgot what the actual sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sum is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sum is the stream that comes from lust for life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The true totem is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be completed, the expectation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real summing is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sum is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic from all guilt."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to listen to the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">There is no way to play with me as we work.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this concession is painful, because what kind of person would prefer to be a house?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we swiftly around in the garden, in front and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always attune to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sum of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we ever stop playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">"you can also say yes, if your child wants to play with you."</seg>
<seg id="741">"perhaps you consider me naive, for a daydream."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you probably have a right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or biscuit is replaced.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and talking my teenage daughter for about 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more it does not need."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece, even at a bad mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no clothes, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready to finish."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is necessary to feel the sums of having a place for peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it is not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure,"</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and save it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I fail and I siege. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" "stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in training, when I wanted to exceed myself more and more."</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the track why not treat yourself to 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sum came back in my spare time. the sum seems to return if I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, she fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sum, the sum is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The totem of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The totem of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of labor is part of me, but only a part. and I am so grateful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it's nice to me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more playing.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer is my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the land I create, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the canvases, the sum, the sums, the other, the right sum: the sum of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this sum, the more this unusual, lasting, naked and new feeling of life makes me wide. less titanium -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel this sum, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">I am a writer. I think of things I am getting to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is a job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamful.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "Yes" "to less work and to play more."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke or after an accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability for self healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions by means of various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"surely, they have heard of one of the most known, the" "deep brain stimulation". "thereby, one electrode deeply implanted in the brain to influence the neurons so that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson who suffered from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"neuromodulation, however, does not mean Neuro-Healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull trauma trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain weakens the brain and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, one must decrease the skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to let cells grow from a tissue return, it is similar to very small children who are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"it is necessary to find proper nutrition, temperature, moisture and environments to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">That is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it made Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"you may also know from the studies of biology that stem cells are immaculate cells, which can turn into every cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they are very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our grand-brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they preserved?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations."</seg>
<seg id="847">"however, this is not so safe."</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-lingual area, and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did."</seg>
<seg id="853">And then highlight colour in order to be able to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we recalled it at the tapping point of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we re-cantiate these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we have re-incarcerate the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario, we passed the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared, as if they had been removed, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added a violation and re-established exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells which have been re-incarnated.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we dyed in vitro and in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">"here, of course, we could not stop."</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had reached a stable level of skill, we were injured in the motor-sensor area in the motor cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen to people, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"the patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover some degree, just like the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey that spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now see, when we re-planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope I can show you soon how the human brain gives the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" I know somebody who can take this. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one has to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this kind of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: it is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a fast professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: take a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to choose the patients, perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, it is necessary to apply it to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">First you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it."</seg>
<seg id="900">"BG, thank you very much."</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as immutable favours.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Ylev from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have clearly demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy disappears with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup -- that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence austerity programs that were carried out in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my honest friends who told me that democracy would abolish if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, in common with me to believe that Lee Kuan Yev, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a wrong belief, we could save the democracy, but that we need a true and defensible democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"because without democracy, our societies are daring, our future düster and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of extravagance, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatened by our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain, who throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all know the debt mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognise his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy sparks and corporations, who are too anxious to invest in it, where it would be productive and produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past three months in the United States, in England and in the eurozone, 3.4 trillion dollars were invested in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, railroads, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until one compares it with the 5,1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, save the stock exchanges and raise the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin summit, which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result are stagnant wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand that would boost the pessimism of investors in which they do not invest in which they would not invest."</seg>
<seg id="925">"involuntarily, the circumstances lead to the fact that Oedipus kills him."</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all this unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop our lives and to finance especially all the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial to the rescue of the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course, the athenical democracy included too many."</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the athenical democracy on account of these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the crucial part of the athenical democracy was and is that they were involved in the working arms, and not only giving them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and crucial that they grant them the right to political co-determination with equal moods in questions of state interests."</seg>
<seg id="935">The athenic democracy has not held long ago --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which glows very bright, it is also quickly burned out."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, today's liberal democracies have not rooted their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the athenic democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible, and the democratic process was delimited into politics, while the economy -- the world of corporations -- became a democracy-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our democracies, since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two, the economy gradually submits politics and deprived them of it."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is important to be in the government today, and yet it is not in power because the power is disposed of by politics into the economy and the areas are separate."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores, that sustainably decimated the animals from which it nourishes itself, that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that has rivulsed politics so far that it is declining itself by the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is growing, political goods will be disposed of, the macroeconomic demand falls, and the managing directors of the corporations are too scary to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism distributes the" demos "[the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that's true, it is obvious that we need to bring the politics and the economy back together and it would be better if the" demos "retain control, as in ancient Athens, except for the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The teaching of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is that so long business and politics are separate areas, automation accelerates the twins, the wastefulness, and social conflicts lower, as it -- already very soon, as I believe -- will come in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we must reshape the economy and re-unite the areas of economy and politics, and ensure that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a pathogenic hyperautocracy that lets the film" "Matrix" "seem like a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is not, therefore, whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the" "matrix", "which is similar to that of" "star Trek", "in which machines are used to people and people put their energy into the research of the universe, or to indulge in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long talks the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it look like to have this "Star Trek" like utopia rather than the "Matrix" -similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in a nutshell."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies, please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital will follow you from one company to another, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income derived from capital and redeeming and the concept of wage labour is completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work therein, and employees working there that the company does not belong. no more exchange between capital and labour, no great gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately not a porous twin summit."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: please introduce briefly that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" cosmos "-- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the net income of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rar."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have, in particular, against the background of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is at the same time the secretary in which they preferred privileged persons, and Marxist because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awake in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and business is... Do we not do this, the technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers denotes a" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the world to the next, as we are currently experiencing it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant."</seg>
<seg id="986">"just like Hayek, that is why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that is why I am also perfect."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are well."</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not wirr you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a sort of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your talk, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of speakers you have clearly said what you think of the West's view of China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my talk, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays, -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain sense, if I can say this provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake in history.</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was very sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be seen in China now resembles the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China now pretending to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smelled tremendously to hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I suppose that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG:</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later for the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely to say goodbye to the complacency, and the permanent denial that a massive reduction in exploitation proceeded massively by the eurozone and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first suggestion that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, have still elected denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism, it might be a while to delay, but if the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you expect?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone looking back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a Minister of Finance, or any minister who is in office after 6 months, particularly in such a tense situation, he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they just wanted to bring our government down, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that went through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to concede that they had been a catastrophic programme in Greece for five years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the Troika of the lenders who imposed this policy was: "this was a colossal error.</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of talks, you seem to be still pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone vis-à-vis a person who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the eurozone does not survive.</seg>

<seg id="1038">"most have never heard of Roy Price, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog and describes herself on Twitter as" movies, TV, technology, tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and contents that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought branch."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't select any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">"this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the site, IMDB. the rating is from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows have received this review."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"will your show be valued at nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addicted, where after one has looked a season, your brain asks:" where are more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what goes off at the end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price doesn't worry about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to offer" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the average charge, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing so, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online, where they can watch everyone free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon out for nothing, do you access right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you can capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skip or check again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data to determine which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and this is the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom via four republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about the same time with another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organizing a competition, he and his team watched the existing data on Netflix viewers, so the ratings they give the shows, their course, which shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together they had a car, and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has thus landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what has happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work in everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it with very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"what you can expect is good television, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work so, this is something terrifying because we live in a time in which we take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions far beyond the television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the Multi-Health Systems company here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come in touch with it in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison here and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it's decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"medium-sized television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always generating the best results. that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most accomplished firms are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it could be predicated by data analysis outbreaks of flu, the awful way -- by analyzing the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked just fine, year around year until it suddenly no longer worked,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data from the most accomplished firms such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data streams directly into decisions of life -- at work, in legal enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people use inconceivable many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be distributed.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">First disassemble this problem into its parts so you can analyze the items; as a second you put the items together to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to resonate parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for that and we all own it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete, to then touch a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think Netflix was so successful, because they have used data and minds, where they belong also in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, what they otherwise would not have been capable of. but the decision on how to take all these parts, put together again and make a show like" House of Cards, "that was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, on the other hand, did so in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when they competed around TV ideas, then selecting" Alpha House "as show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" they tell us the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget that, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it's also called" "Magic 8 Ball". "it's amazing. for decisions using a Je- or No-issue you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." "highly likely" "-- right here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fuse it later with a technology demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I have made some decisions in my life, where I should have listened to the ball in retrospect."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"eventually, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data, it still pays off to make decisions, an expert in what you are doing, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
